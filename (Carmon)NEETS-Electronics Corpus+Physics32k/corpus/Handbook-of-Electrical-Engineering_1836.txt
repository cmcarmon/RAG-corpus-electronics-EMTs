The array pattern function reveals how selective a particular beamforming system is. In the case of a typical
array function shown in Eq. (17.9), the beamwidth, which is the width of the main lobe of the array pattern,
is  inversely  proportional  to  the  array  aperture.  Because  of  the  periodicity  of  the  array  pattern  function,  the
main lobe is repeated at intervals of 2p/D. These repetitive lobes are called grating lobes, whose existence may
be interpreted in terms of spatial frequency aliasing resulting from a sampling interval D due to the N receiving
sensors located at discrete points in space. If the spacing D between sensors satisÔ¨Åes
