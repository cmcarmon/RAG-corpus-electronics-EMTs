Oscillations are started by applying the proper magnetic field to the tube. The field value required is 
slightly higher than the critical value. In the split-anode tube, the critical value is the field value required 
to cause all the electrons to miss the plate when its halves are operating at the same potential. The 
alternating voltages impressed on the plates by the oscillations generated in the tank circuit will cause 
electron motion, such as that shown in figure 2-24, and current will flow. Since a very concentrated 
magnetic field is required for the negative-resistance magnetron oscillator, the length of the tube plate is 
limited to a few centimeters to keep the magnet at reasonable dimensions. In addition, a small diameter 
tube is required to make the magnetron operate efficiently at microwave frequencies. A heavy-walled 
plate is used to increase the radiating properties of the tube. Artificial cooling methods, such as forced-air 
or water-cooled systems, are used to obtain still greater dissipation in these high-output tubes.
