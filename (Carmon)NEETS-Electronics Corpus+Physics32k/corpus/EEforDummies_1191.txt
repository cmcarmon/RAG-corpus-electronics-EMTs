etting up to speed on electronics really pays off when you get to the 
point where you can actually build a project or two. In this chapter, 
you get to play with several fun, entertaining, and educational electronics 
gadgets that you can build in half an hour or less. I selected the proj-
ects for their high cool factor and their simplicity. Iâ€™ve kept parts 
to a minimum, and the most expensive project costs under 
$15 or so to build.
