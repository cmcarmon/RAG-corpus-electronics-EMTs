Article 4 of the Law on General Provisions (in effect since 1838) states that "The law has no retroactive effect".
Article 1 of Criminal Law states that no act is punishable without a pre-existing law, and that in the case an act was punishable but the law was changed after the criminal act the "most favorable" (to the suspect) of the two laws will apply.
In Civil Law there is no such provision.
