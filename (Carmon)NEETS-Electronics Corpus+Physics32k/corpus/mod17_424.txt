Signals received by the fax receiver are amplified and actuate a recording mechanism. This recorder 
makes a permanent recording (segment by segment) on paper. The paper is attached to a receiver drum 
similar to the one in the fax transmitter. The receiver drum rotates synchronously with the transmitter 
drum. Synchronization of the receiver and transmitter is done to reduce distortion. Synchronization is 
obtained by driving both receiver and transmitter drums with synchronous motors operating at the same 
speed. Drum rotation continues until the original picture is reproduced. The recording mechanism may 
reproduce the picture photographically by using a modulated light source shining on photographic paper 
or film. It may also reproduce directly by burning a white protective coating from specially prepared 
black recording paper.
