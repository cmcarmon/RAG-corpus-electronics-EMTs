The amount of power available in an active satellite is limited by the weight restrictions imposed on 
the satellite. Early communications satellites were limited to a few hundred pounds because of launch-
vehicle payload restraints. The only feasible power source is the inefficient solar cell. (Total power 
generation in the earlier satellites was less than 50 watts.) As you can see, the rf power output is severely 
limited; therefore, a relatively weak signal is transmitted by the satellite on the down link. The weak 
transmitted signal is often reduced by propagation losses. This results in a very weak signal being 
available at the earth terminals. The level of signals received from a satellite is comparable to the 
combination of external atmospheric noise and internal noise of standard receivers. Special techniques 
must be used to extract the desired information from the received signal. Large, high-gain antennas and 
special types of preamplifiers solve this problem but add complexity and size to the earth terminal. (The 
smallest terminal in the defense communication systems network has effectively an 18-foot antenna and 
weighs 19,500 pounds.) Development of more efficient power sources and relaxation of weight 
restrictions have permitted improved satellite performance and increased capacity.
