The two most dangerous electrical paths through the human body are hand‐
to‐hand and left hand to either foot. If electrical current passes from one 
hand to the other, on its way it passes through the heart. If current passes 
from the left hand to either foot, it passes through the heart as well as sev-
eral major organs.
