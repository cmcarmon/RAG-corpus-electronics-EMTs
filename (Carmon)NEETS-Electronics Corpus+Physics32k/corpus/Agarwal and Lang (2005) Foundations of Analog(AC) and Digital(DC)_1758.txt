A related observation concerns the long-time behavior of the circuit. We
have also seen in Chapter 10 that the transient behavior of a capacitor is to
act as an open circuit as t → ∞, while the corresponding transient behavior
of an inductor is to act as a short circuit. This behavior is also observed in
Figure 12.28, since vIN appears entirely across the capacitor as t → ∞, since
vC → V◦.
