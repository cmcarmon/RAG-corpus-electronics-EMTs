There are two kinds of fields; one is associated with voltage and the other with current. The field
associated with voltage is called the ELECTRIC (E) FIELD. It exerts a force on any electric charge
placed in it. The field associated with current is called a MAGNETIC (H) FIELD, because it tends to
exert a force on any magnetic pole placed in it. Figure 3-14 illustrates the way in which the E fields and H
fields tend to orient themselves between conductors of a typical two-wire transmission line. The
illustration shows a cross section of the transmission lines. The E field is represented by solid lines and
the H field by dotted lines. The arrows indicate the direction of the lines of force. Both fields normally
exist together and are spoken of collectively as the electromagnetic field.
