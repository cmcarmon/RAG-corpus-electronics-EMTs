The superheterodyne is the most popular receiver type. In a
superheterodyne receiver, the signals are offset downward by a
local oscillator. Ampliﬁcation and ﬁltering take place at a lower
frequency or intermediate frequency. This type of receiver has
the advantage of good sensitivity, high gain selectivity, and
reliability.
