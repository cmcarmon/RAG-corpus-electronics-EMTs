In our example (fig. 3-1), we summarized requisitions based on unit identification codes (UIC). We 
first sorted the input data file on the field that contains the UIC. We provided specifications to the RPG 
program to tell it to accumulate totals from the detail (individual) data records until the UIC changed. We 
then told it to print the total number of requisitions and total cost for that UIC. We did not have it print 
each detail record, although we could have. The UIC is called the control field. Each time the control field 
changes, there is a control break. Each time there is a control break, the program prints the summary 
information. After all records are read and processed, it prints a summary line (TOTALS) for all UICs. 
You can also use RPGs to generate a program to update data files.
