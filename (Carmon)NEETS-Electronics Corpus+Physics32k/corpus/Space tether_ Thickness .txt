For rotating tethers not significantly affected by gravity, the thickness also varies, and it can be shown that the area, A, is given as a function of r (the distance from the centre) as follows:

{\displaystyle A(r)={\frac {Mv^{2}}{TR}}\mathrm {e} ^{{\frac {\delta }{T}}{\frac {v^{2}}{2}}\left(1-{\frac {r^{2}}{R^{2}}}\right)}}

where R is the radius of tether, v is the velocity with respect to the centre, M is the tip mass,



δ


{\displaystyle \delta }
is the material density, and T is the design tensile strength (Young's modulus divided by safety factor).
