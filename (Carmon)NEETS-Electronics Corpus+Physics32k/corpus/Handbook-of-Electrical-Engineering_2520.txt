Example 1
A  transistor  is  to  be  biased  at  a  collector  current  of  1  mA  when  a  12-V  power  supply  is  applied.  Using  the
circuit of Fig. 24.27, determine the values of R1, R2, and RE if 3.4 V is to be dropped across RE and if the current
through R2 is to be 10 IBQ. Assume that for the transistor used, VBEQ = 0.6 V and hFE = 100.
