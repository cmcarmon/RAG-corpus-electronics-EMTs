4 This work was done as part of an AFOSR MURI project for determining
the effect of deliberate electromagnetic (EM) interference on digital and
computer systems; the interference pattern is expected to be a train of EM
pulses for some duration followed by a silent period, with this pattern
repeating at some frequency that is dependent on the power capability of the
interfering source. EM interference is also expected to cause multiple transient
faults, especially on off-chip wiring like memory busses.
