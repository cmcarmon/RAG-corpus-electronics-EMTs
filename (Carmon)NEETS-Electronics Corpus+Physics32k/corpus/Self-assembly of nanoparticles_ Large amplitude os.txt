Large amplitude oscillatory shear (LAOS) is most effective for particles that are 100 nm-1 Âµm in size. Hard and soft shears can order in steady shear. However, this assembly strongly relies on particle volume fraction, particle interaction potentials, polydisterity, and shear rate and strain. The large amount of directing factors can cause complications in directing self-assembly by LAOS. Diblock copolymer micells have been studied in regard to structuring nanoparticles in bulk.
