The principle of negative feedback is clearly illustrated in the operation of the inverting
ampliﬁer in Example 5.2.1, since negative feedback is used to keep the inverting terminal voltage
as close as possible to the noninverting terminal voltage. One way of viewing negative feedback
is to consider it as a self-balancing mechanism which allows the ampliﬁer to preserve zero
