complex, one must compute a large number of conditional density functions. Simulation can easily solve this
problem for most practical systems. A noise-free simulation is executed, and the value of the decision metric
is  recorded  in  a  data  ﬁle.  Once  the  simulation  is  complete,  this  information  can  be  used  to  reconstruct  the
conditional  and  ultimately  the  unconditional  error  rate.  This  method  generates  highly  accurate  estimates  of
the BER and makes very efﬁcient use of computer resources, but can only be used in the special cases where
one can analytically determine the conditional pdf.
