The build-up of film on the contact surfaces of a relay is another cause of relay trouble. Although
film will form on the contacts by the action of atmospheric and other gases, grease film is responsible for
a lot of contact trouble. Carbon build-up which is caused by the burning of a grease film or other
substance (during arcing), also can be troublesome. Carbon forms rings on the contact surfaces and as the
carbon rings build-up, the relay contacts are held open.
