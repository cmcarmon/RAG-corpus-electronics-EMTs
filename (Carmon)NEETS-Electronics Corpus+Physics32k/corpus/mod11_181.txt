The space-charge wheel rotates about the cathode at an angular velocity of 2 poles (anode segments) 
per cycle of the ac field. This phase relationship enables the concentration of electrons to continuously 
deliver energy to sustain the rf oscillations. Electrons emitted from the area of the cathode between the 
spokes are quickly returned to the cathode.
