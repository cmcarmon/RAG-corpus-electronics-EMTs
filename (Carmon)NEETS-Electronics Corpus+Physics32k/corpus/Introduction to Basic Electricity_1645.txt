A resistor may have a fifth band (Figure 13â€‘15). 
This band indicates the reliability of the resistor. It tells 
how many of the resistors (per thousand) will fail after 
100 hours of operation. Generally, when there are five 
bands on a resistor, the same amount of body color 
shows at each end. In this case, look for the tolerance 
band, position it on the right, and read the resistor as 
described previously.
