Multicontact switches (other than rotary switches, which will be covered later) are usually classified
by the number of POLES and number of THROWS. Poles are shown in schematics as those contacts
through which current enters the switch; they are connected to the movable contacts. Each pole may be
connected to another part of the circuit through the switch by "throwing" the switch (movable contacts) to
another position. This action provides an individual conduction path through the switch for each pole
connection. The number of THROWS indicates the number of different circuits that can be controlled by
each pole. By counting the number of points where current enters the switch (from the schematic symbol
or the switch itself), you can determine the number of poles. By counting the number of different points
each pole can connect with, you can determine the number of throws.
