Connecting batteries to circuits
You use a 9‐volt (PP3) battery clip (shown in Figure 12-4) to connect an indi-
vidual 9‐volt battery to a circuit. Battery clips snap onto the terminals of the 
battery (those snaps on the top of the battery are known as a PP3 connec-
tor); they contain black and red leads that you connect to your circuit. You 
strip the insulation from the ends of the black and red wires, and then con-
nect the leads (the bare ends) to your circuit. You can connect the leads to 
terminals, insert them into holes in a breadboard, or solder them directly to 
components. I discuss all these techniques in Chapter 15.
