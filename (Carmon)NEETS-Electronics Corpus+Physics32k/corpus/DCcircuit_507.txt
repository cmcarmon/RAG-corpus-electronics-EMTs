Eventually in this book I will lead you through the analysis of circuits without the use of
any numbers, that is, analyzing the effects of component failure in a circuit without knowing
exactly how many volts the battery produces, how many ohms of resistance is in each resistor,
etc. This section serves as an introductory step to that kind of analysis.
