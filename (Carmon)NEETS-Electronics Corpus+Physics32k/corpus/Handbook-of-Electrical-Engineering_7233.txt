However,  the  growth  of  decentralized  storage  and  computing  created  yet  another  problem—work  groups
needed to share information—and much of this information resided in individual hard disks. Furthermore,
despite  the  declining  costs  of  personal  computers  and  associated  technology,  it  was  and  still  is  considerably
expensive to “fully load” the workforce with all of the applications it needs. The ability to share applications
became desirable. It was these two trends which highlighted the need for LANs.
