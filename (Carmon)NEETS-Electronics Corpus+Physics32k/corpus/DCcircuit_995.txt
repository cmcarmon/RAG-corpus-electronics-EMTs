While the above rules are speciﬁc for a three mesh circuit, the rules may be extended to
smaller or larger meshes. The ﬁgure below illustrates the application of the rules. The three
currents are all drawn in the same direction, counterclockwise. One KVL equation is written
for each of the three loops. Note that there is no polarity drawn on the resistors. We do
not need it to determine the signs of the coefﬁcients. Though we do need to pay attention to
the polarity of the voltage source with respect to current direction. The I3counterclockwise
current traverses the 24V source from (+) to (-). This is a voltage rise for electron current ﬂow.
Therefore, the third equation right hand side is +24V.
