Introduction
Deﬁnition of Device Modeling
We use various terms such as device characterization, parameter extraction, optimization, and model ﬁtting
to address an important engineering task. In all of these, we start with a mathematical model that describes
the transistor behavior. The model has a number of parameters which are varied or adjusted to match the IV
(current-voltage)  characteristics  of  a  particular  transistor  or  set  of  transistors.  The  act  of  determining  the
appropriate set of model parameters is what we call device modeling. We then use the model with the particular
set of parameters that represent our transistors in a circuit simulator such as SPICE1 to simulate how circuits
with our kinds of transistors will behave. Usually the models are supplied by the circuit simulator we chose.
Occasionally we may want to modify these models or construct our own models. In this case we need access
to the circuit simulator model subroutines as well as the program that performs the device characterization.
