Generally, materials display either a flat R curve or a rising R curve. For a flat R curve, material resistance is constant with respect to crack extension. When the resistance curve is flat, it exhibits a critical value of energy release rate Gc. A material with a rising R curve, however, cannot be uniquely characterized with a single toughness value. A flawed structure fails when the driving force curve is tangent to the R curve, but this point of tangency depends on the shape of the driving force curve, which depends on the configuration of the structure. Materials with rising R curves are generally characterized by the value of G at the beginning of crack growth, but the precise moment of initiation is unclear. The R curve for an ideally brittle material is flat because the surface energy is a fixed property. Nonlinear behavior, like ductile fracture, can result in a rising R curve as the plastic zone at crack tip increases in size with extension. Falling R curves occur when a metal fails by cleavage. Cleavage propagation is unstable and very high strain rates are found near the crack tip. This suppresses plastic deformation.
