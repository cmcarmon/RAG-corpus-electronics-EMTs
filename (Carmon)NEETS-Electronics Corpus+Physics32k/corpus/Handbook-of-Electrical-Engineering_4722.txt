Using  these  so-called  stiffened  elastic  constants,  we  obtain  the  same  third-order  eigenvalue  equation,  Eq.
(48.3), and hence the velocities of each of the three modes and the corresponding mechanical displacement
components. The potential is obtained from Eq. (48.8). The velocities obtained for the piezoelectric material
are usually at most a few percent higher than would be obtained with the piezoelectricity ignored. The parameter
