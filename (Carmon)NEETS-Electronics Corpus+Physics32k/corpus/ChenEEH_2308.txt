ated line (open or short) plotted as a function of its length. The
half wavelength periodicity is evident. Depending on the line’s
electrical
the input reactance is either capacitive
(X < 0) or inductive (X > 0). This suggests that a discrete
capacitor or inductor can be constructed from an appropriate
length of shorted or open-circuited transmission line. In prac-
tice, at microwave frequencies, it is necessary to have a small
footprint and reduced parasitic effects for the element. This
precludes the use of conventional transmission lines. Instead,
for example, an RF inductor is made of a planar spiral etched
on a printed circuit board, and a miniature capacitor is con-
structed in parallel plate conﬁguration using a material with
high er and metallized pads for the contacts (see Wadell [1991]
in Appendix A for further reading).
