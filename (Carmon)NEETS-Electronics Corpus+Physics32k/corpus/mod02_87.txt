 As stated before, the basic unit of inductance (L) is the HENRY (H), named after Joseph Henry, the 
co-discoverer with Faraday of the principle of electromagnetic induction. An inductor has an inductance 
of 1 henry if an emf of 1 volt is induced in the inductor when the current through the inductor is changing 
at the rate of 1 ampere per second. The relationship between the induced voltage, the inductance, and the 
rate of change of current with respect to time is stated mathematically as:
