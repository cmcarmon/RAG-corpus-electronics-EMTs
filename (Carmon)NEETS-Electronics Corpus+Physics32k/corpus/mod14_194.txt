The OCTAL NUMBER SYSTEM is a base 8 system and is quite useful as a tool in the conversion
of binary numbers. This system works because 8 is an integral power of 2; that is, 23 = 8. The use of octal
numbers reduces the number of digits required to represent the binary equivalent of a decimal number.
