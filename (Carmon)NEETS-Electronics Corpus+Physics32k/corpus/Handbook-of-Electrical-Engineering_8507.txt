Execution of most operations within a computer takes place in the  arithmetic and logic unit (ALU) of a
processor. Consider a typical example. Suppose that two numbers located in the main memory are to be added,
and  the  sum  is  to  be  stored  back  into  the  memory.  Using  a  few  instructions,  each  consisting  of  a  few  basic
steps, determined by the control unit, the operands are Ô¨Årst fetched from the memory into the processor. They
are then added in the ALU, and the result is stored back in memory. Processors contain a number of high-speed
storage elements called registers, which are used for temporary storage of operands. Each register contains one
