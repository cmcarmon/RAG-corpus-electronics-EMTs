(b) To Ô¨Ånd the Norton equivalent, we modify the schematic in Fig. 4.53(a)
by replaying the probing current source with a probing voltage source
V1. The result is the schematic in Fig. 4.54(a). Again, in the DC Sweep
dialog  box,  we  select  Linear  for  the  Sweep  Type and  Voltage  Source
for the Sweep Var. Type. We enter V1 under Name box, 0 as Start Value,
1 as End Value, and 0.1 as Increment. Under the PSpice A/D Window,
we add trace I (V1) and obtain the plot in Fig. 4.54(b). From the plot,
we obtain
