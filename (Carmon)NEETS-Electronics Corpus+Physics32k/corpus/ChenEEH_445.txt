A generic small-signal diode-equivalent circuit (EC) is given in
Figure 5.4. Cd and the junction conductance Gd have been
deﬁned in equation 5.10 and Cj is given by equation 5.4. Rs is
the series resistance, which is a lumped representation of all
contributing components discussed before. The voltage vj
across the junction is smaller than the applied terminal voltage
v due to the voltage drop across Rs. In a realistic diode struc-
ture, additional parasitic elements have to be taken into ac-
count, such as a sidewall capacitance and—in integrated
circuits—a parasitic pn-junction that is connected to a differ-
ent terminal. For tunneling diodes, the effect of a negative
differential resistance is usually taken into account in the
small-signal EC by an inductance in series to Rs.
