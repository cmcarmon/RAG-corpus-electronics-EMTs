The first microbeam facilities delivered charged particles. A charged particle microbeam facility must meet the following basic requirements:
The beam spot size should be on the order of a few micrometres or smaller, corresponding to cellular or sub-cellular dimensions.
Irradiations of living cells should take place at atmospheric pressure.
Beam current must be reduced to levels such that targets may be irradiated with an exact number of particles with high reproducibility.
An imaging system is required to visualize and register cellular targets.
Cell positioning must have high spatial resolution and reproducibility in order that the ion beam hit the target with a high degree of accuracy and precision.
A particle detector with high efficiency must count the number of particles per target and switch off the beam after the desired number of particles have been delivered.
Environmental conditions (humidity, for example) for cells must be maintained such that cells are under little or no stress.
