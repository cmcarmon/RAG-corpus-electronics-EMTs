If we were to define the word computer, we would say a computer is an instrument for performing 
mathematical operations, such as addition, multiplication, division, subtraction, integration, vector 
resolution, coordinate conversion, and special function generation at very high speeds. But the usage of 
computers goes well beyond the mathematical-operations level.
