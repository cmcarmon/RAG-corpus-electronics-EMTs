To use a megger to check wiring insulation, connect one test lead to the insulation and the other test
lead to the conductor, after isolating the wiring from the equipment. Turn the hand crank until the slip
clutch just begins to slip and note the meter reading. Normal insulations should read infinity. Any small
resistance reading indicates the insulation is breaking down.
