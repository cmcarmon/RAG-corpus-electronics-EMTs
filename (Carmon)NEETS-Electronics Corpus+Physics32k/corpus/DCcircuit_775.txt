A close examination of this meter will reveal one ”common” jack for the black test lead and
three others for the red test lead. The jack into which the red lead is shown inserted is labeled
for voltage and resistance measurement, while the other two jacks are labeled for current (A,
mA, and µA) measurement. This is a wise design feature of the multimeter, requiring the user
to move a test lead plug from one jack to another in order to switch from the voltage measure-
ment to the current measurement function. It would be hazardous to have the meter set in
current measurement mode while connected across a signiﬁcant source of voltage because of
the low input resistance, and making it necessary to move a test lead plug rather than just
ﬂip the selector switch to a different position helps ensure that the meter doesn’t get set to
measure current unintentionally.
