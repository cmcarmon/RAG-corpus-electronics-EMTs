The token Passing Ring protocol uses two subﬁelds in the
frame to recognize whether the frame is copied successfully
by the destination and whether a duplicated address is
detected. When a frame is returned to the sender, the subﬁeld
C indicates that the frame is copied to the destination buffer,
and the subﬁeld A indicates if the duplicated address condition
has been detected. A destination station detects the duplicated
address condition when it ﬁnds out that some other station
already marks the C bit. Unlike CSMA/CD, Token Passing Ring
protocol provides the priority and reservation algorithms in
the protocol. The following steps outline the algorithm with
notations Pm, which is the priority of the message to transmit;
Pr, which is the priority of the token protocol; and Rr, which is
the receive reservation priority.
