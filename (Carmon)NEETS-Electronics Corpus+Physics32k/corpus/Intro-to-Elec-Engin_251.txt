(Note that the procedure is similar to that of Example 3.2.3.) The Thévenin resistance seen by the
capacitor for t > 0 is found by considering the circuit for t > 0 while setting all ideal sources to
zero, as shown in Figure E3.2.4(b).
The time constant of the capacitor voltage is τ = RThC = 6 × 5 = 30 s. The steady-state
value of the capacitor voltage for t > 0, vC, ss(t ), is found by replacing the capacitor by an open
circuit (since the source is dc in the circuit for t > 0), as shown in Figure E3.2.4(c).
