Vibrations can damage a mechanical system as a result of several processes, among which are:
the exceeding of characteristic instantaneous stress limits (yield stress, ultimate stress etc.)
the damage by fatigue following the application of a large number of cycles.
ERS is used according to the first criterion. The second is considered with the fatigue damage spectrum (FDS).
