One example of zero state response being used is in integrator and differentiator circuits. By examining a simple integrator circuit it can be demonstrated that when a function is put into a linear time-invariant (LTI) system, an output can be characterized by a superposition or sum of the Zero Input Response and the zero state response.
A system can be represented as




f
(
t
)



{\displaystyle f(t)\,}




y
(
t
)
=
y

)

f

)
.



{\displaystyle f(t).\ }
on the left and the output



y
(
t
)
.



{\displaystyle y(t).\ }
on the right.
The output



y
(
t
)
.



{\displaystyle y(t).\ }
can be separated into a zero input and a zero state solution with




y
(

)
=

{\displaystyle y(t_{0})\,}
and

This behavior constitutes a linear system. A linear system has an output that is a sum of distinct zero-input and zero-state components, each varying linearly, with the initial state of the system and the input of the system respectively.
The zero input response and zero state response are independent of each other and therefore each component can be computed independently of the other.
