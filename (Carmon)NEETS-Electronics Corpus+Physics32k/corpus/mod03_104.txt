The hot-wire meter movement deflection depends on the expansion of a high-resistance wire caused
by the heating effect of the wire itself as current flows through it. (See fig. 1-17.) A resistance wire is
stretched taut between the two meter terminals, with a thread attached at a right angle to the center of the
wire. A spring connected to the opposite end of the thread exerts a constant tension on the resistance wire.
Current flow heats the wire, causing it to expand. This motion is transferred to the meter pointer through
the thread and a pivot.
