Figure 115.3 provides an overview of the computational processes involved in
performing spectral analysis of the EEG, i.e., including computation of auto and
cross spectra
 [Bronzino, 1984]. It is to be noted that the power spectrum is the
autocorrellogram, i.e., the correlation of the signal with itself. As a result, the power
spectrum provides only magnitude information in the frequency domain; it does
not provide any data regarding phase. The power spectrum is computed by:
