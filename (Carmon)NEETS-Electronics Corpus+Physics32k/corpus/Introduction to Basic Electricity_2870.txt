How the transformer is wound determines whether 
it produces a phase	shift or not. When both the pri-
mary and secondary windings are wound in the same 
direction, there is no phase shift of the output signal 
with respect to the input signal. If the secondary wind-
ing is wound in the opposite direction to the primary 
winding, the output waveform will be shifted 180Â° 
from the input waveform and represents a phase shift. 
The application determines how important the phase 
shift is (Figure 27-5).
