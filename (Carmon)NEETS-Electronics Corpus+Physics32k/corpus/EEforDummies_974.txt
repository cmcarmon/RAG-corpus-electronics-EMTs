Many electronic systems, such as the radio‐receiver system shown in  
Figure 14-1, are represented in schematics by several stages of circuitry —  
even though the system really consists of one large, complex circuit. The 
schematic for such a system shows the sub‐circuits for each stage in a 
left‐to‐right progression (for instance, the tuner sub‐circuit on the left, the 
detector in the middle, and the amplifier on the right), with the output 
of the first stage feeding into the input of the second stage, and so forth. 
Organizing schematics in this way helps make complex circuits more 
 understandable.
