Transmission line constants, called distributed constants, are spread along the entire length of the
transmission line and cannot be distinguished separately. The amount of inductance, capacitance, and
resistance depends on the length of the line, the size of the conducting wires, the spacing between the
wires, and the dielectric (air or insulating medium) between the wires. The following paragraphs will be
useful to you as you study distributed constants on a transmission line.
