problem is solved by making the overcurrent relays directional.
By  this  is  meant  that  the  relays  will  respond  as  overcurrent
relays  only  if  the  fault  is  in  the  forward  direction  from  the
relays, i.e., in the direction in which their zone of protection
extends.  The  directionality  is  provided  by  making  the  relay
sensitive  to  the  phase  angle  between  the  fault  current  and  a
reference quantity, such as the line voltage at the relay location.
Other  reference  sources  are  also  possible,  including  currents
in the neutral of a transformer bank at the substation.
