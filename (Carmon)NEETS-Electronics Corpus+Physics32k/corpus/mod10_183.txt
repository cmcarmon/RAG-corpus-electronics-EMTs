The polarity of charges and the direction of the electric fields will reverse polarity and direction
periodically at the frequency of the voltage source. The electric field will build up from zero to maximum
in one direction and then collapse back to zero. Next, the field will build up to maximum in the opposite
direction and then collapse back to zero. This complete reversal occurs during a single cycle of the source
voltage. The HALF-WAVE DIPOLE ANTENNA (two separate rods in line as illustrated in figure 1-27)
is the fundamental element normally used as a starting point of reference in any discussion concerning the
radiation of electromagnetic energy into space. If rf energy from the ac generator (or transmitter) is
supplied to the element of an antenna, the voltage across the antenna lags the current by 90 degrees. The
antenna acts as if it were a capacitor.
