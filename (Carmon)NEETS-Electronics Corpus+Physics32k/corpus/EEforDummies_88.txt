To use a battery in a circuit, you connect one side of your load — for 
instance, a light bulb — to the negative terminal and the other side of your 
load to the positive terminal. (A terminal is just a piece of metal connected 
to an electrode to which you can hook up wires.) You’ve created a path that 
allows the charges to move, and electrons flow from the negative terminal, 
through the circuit, to the positive terminal. As they pass through the wire fil-
ament of the light bulb, some of the electrical energy supplied by the battery 
is converted to light and heat, causing the filament to glow and get warm.
