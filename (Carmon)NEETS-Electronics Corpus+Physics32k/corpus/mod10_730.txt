The directivity pattern resulting from the action of parasitic elements depends on two factors. These 
are (1) the tuning, determined by the length of the parasitic element; and (2) the spacing between the 
parasitic and driven elements. To a lesser degree, it also depends on the diameter of the parasitic element, 
since diameter has an effect on tuning.
