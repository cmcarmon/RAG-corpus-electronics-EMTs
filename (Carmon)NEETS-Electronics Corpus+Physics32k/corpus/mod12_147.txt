The sensitivity of the dynamic microphone is almost as high as that of the carbon type. It is 
lightweight and requires no external voltage. The dynamic microphone is rugged and can withstand the 
effects of vibration, temperature, and moisture. This microphone has a uniform response over a frequency 
range that extends from 40 to 15,000 hertz. The impedance is very low (generally 50 ohms or less). A 
transformer is required to match its impedance to that of the input of an af amplifier.
