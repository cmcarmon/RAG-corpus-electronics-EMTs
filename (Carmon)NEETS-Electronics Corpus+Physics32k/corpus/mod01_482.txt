In some electrical devices the wattage rating indicates the maximum power the device is designed to
use rather than the normal operating power. A 150-watt lamp, for example, uses 150 watts when operated
at the specified voltage printed on the bulb. In contrast, a device such as a resistor is not normally given a
voltage or a current rating. A resistor is given a power rating in watts and can be operated at any
combination of voltage and current as long as the power rating is not exceeded. In most circuits, the actual
power used by a resistor is considerably less than the power rating of the resistor because a 50% safety
factor is used. For example, if a resistor normally used 2 watts of power, a resistor with a power rating of
3 watts would be used.
