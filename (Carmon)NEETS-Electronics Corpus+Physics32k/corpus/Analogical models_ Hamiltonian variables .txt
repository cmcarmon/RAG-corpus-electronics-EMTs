The Hamiltonian variables, also called the energy variables, are those variables which when time differentiated are equal to the power conjugate variables. The Hamiltonian variables are so called because they are the variables which usually appear in Hamiltonian mechanics. The Hamiltonian variables in the electrical domain are charge (q) and flux linkage (λ) because,







d
λ


d
t



=
v


{\displaystyle {\frac {d\lambda }{dt}}=v}
(Faraday's law of induction) and,






d
q


d
t



=
i


{\displaystyle {\frac {dq}{dt}}=i}

In the translational mechanical domain the Hamiltonian variables are distance displacement (x) and momentum (p) because,







d
p


d
t



=
F


{\displaystyle {\frac {dp}{dt}}=F}
(Newton's second law of motion) and,






d
x


d
t



=
u


{\displaystyle {\frac {dx}{dt}}=u}

There is a corresponding relationship for other analogies and sets of variables. The Hamiltonian variables are also called the energy variables. The integrand of a power conjugate variable with respect to a Hamiltonian variable is a measure of energy. For instance,




∫
F
d
x


{\displaystyle \int Fdx}
and,



∫
u
d
p


{\displaystyle \int udp}

are both expressions of energy.
