Because of the reliability of semiconductor devices, servicing techniques developed for
transistorized equipment differ from those normally used for electron-tube circuits. Electron tubes are
usually considered to be the circuit component most susceptible to failure and are normally the first
components to be tested. Transistors, however, are capable of operating in excess of 30,000 hours at
maximum rating without failure. They are often soldered in the circuit in much the same manner as
resistors and capacitors. Therefore, they are NOT so quickly removed for testing as tubes.
