Quantization
Let Figure 15.3.1(a) illustrate a message f (t) with values between 0 and 7 V. A sequence of
exact samples taken at uniform intervals of time is shown: 1.60, 3.70, 4.75, 3.90, 3.45, and
5.85 V. Quantization consists of rounding exact sample values to the nearest of a set of discrete
amplitudes called quantum levels. Assuming the quantizer to have eight quantum levels (0, 1,
2, . . . , 7 V), a sequence of quantized samples (2, 4, 5, 4, 3, and 6 V) is shown in Figure 15.3.1(a).
Obviously, the scheme is not limited to messages with only nonnegative voltages. The quantizer
is said to be uniform when the step size between any two adjacent quantum levels is a constant,
denoted by Î´v volts. Quantizers with nonuniform step size are also designed for improved system
performance. An L-level quantizer can have even or odd L. A quantizer is said to be saturated or
overloaded when
