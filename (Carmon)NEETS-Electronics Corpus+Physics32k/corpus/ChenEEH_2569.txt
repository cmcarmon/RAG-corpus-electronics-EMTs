The integer number l ¼ 0, 1, 2, 3 refers to the number of half-
guided-wavelengths that ﬁt into a longitudinal section of a
waveguide. The values of p can be obtained from the zeros of
the Bessel functions and their derivatives for TM and TE
modes, respectively. In view of the resonant frequency, the
dominant mode is TM010 for d=a < 2, while the TE111 mode
becomes dominant for d=a > 2.
