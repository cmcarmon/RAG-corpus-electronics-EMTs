highest range of the ammeter; then you should switch progressively to lower ranges until a suitable
reading is obtained. Most ammeter scales indicate the current being measured in increasing values from
left to right. If you connect the meter without observing proper polarity, the pointer may be deflected
backwards (from right to left). This action often damages the meter movement. You should ensure that
the ammeter is always connected so that the current will flow into the negative terminal and out the
positive terminal. Figure 3-6 shows various circuit arrangements and the proper ammeter connection
methods to measure current in various portions of the circuit.
