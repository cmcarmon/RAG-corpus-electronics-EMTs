Parallel Transfer Disks
Some high-performance disk drives make it possible to read or write from multiple disk surfaces at the same
time. For example, the Cray DD-19 and DD-49 disks described in the second section have a parallel transfer
capability. The advantage is that much higher transfer rates can be achieved, but no assistance is provided for
seek or rotational latency. Thus transfer units are correspondingly larger in these systems.
