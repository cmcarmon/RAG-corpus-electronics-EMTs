In physics and engineering, a free body diagram (force diagram, or FBD) is a graphical illustration used to visualize the applied forces, movements, and resulting reactions on a body in a given condition. They depict a body or connected bodies with all of the applied forces and moments, as well as reactions, that act on that/those body(ies). The body may consist of multiple internal members, for example, a truss, or be a compact body such as a beam. A series of free bodies and other diagrams may be necessary to solve complex problems.
