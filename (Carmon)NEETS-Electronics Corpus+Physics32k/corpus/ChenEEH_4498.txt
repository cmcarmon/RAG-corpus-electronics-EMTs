terms of the cost cumulants. Cost cumulant control, which is
also called statistical control, views the optimization criterion
as a random variable and minimizes any cumulant of the
optimization criterion. Then LQG, MCV, and RS are all special
cases of cost cumulant control where in LQG the mean, in
MCV the variance, and in RS all cumulants of the cost func-
tion are optimized. This chapter provides the optimal control-
lers for the LQG, MCV, and RS methods. Finally, satellite
attitude control application using RS controller and building
control application using MCV controller are described.
