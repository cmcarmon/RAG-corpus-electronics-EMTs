(tones). A tuning fork, when struck, produces a pure tone of a specific frequency. This pure tone is
produced by regular vibrations of the source (tines of the tuning fork). On the other hand, scraping your
fingernails across a blackboard only creates noise, because the vibrations are irregular. Each individual
pipe of a pipe organ is similar to a tuning fork, and each pipe produces a tone of a specific frequency. But
sounding two or more pipes at the same time produces a complex waveform. A tone that closely imitates
any of the vowel sounds can be produced by selecting the proper pipes and sounding them at the same
time. Figure 1-15 illustrates the combining of two pure tones to make a COMPLEX WAVE.
