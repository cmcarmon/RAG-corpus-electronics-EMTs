Data Integrity
In general, during the design of a database schema several integrity constraints are identiﬁed. These constraints
may include the uniqueness of a key value, restrictions on the domain of an attribute name, and the ability of
an attribute to have a null value. A DBMS includes mechanisms with which integrity constraints can be speciﬁed.
Constraints  such  as  key  uniqueness  and  the  admissibility  of  null  values  can  be  speciﬁed  during  schema
deﬁnition. Also, more elaborate integrity constraints can be speciﬁed. For example, constraints can be imposed
