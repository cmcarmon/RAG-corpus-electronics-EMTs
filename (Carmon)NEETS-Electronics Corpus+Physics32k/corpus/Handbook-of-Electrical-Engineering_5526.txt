Static VAR compensators provide solutions to two types of compensation problems normally encountered
in  practical  power  systems  [Gyugyi  et al.,  1978].  The  ﬁrst  is  load  compensation,  where  the  requirements  are
usually to reduce or cancel the reactive power demand of large and ﬂuctuating industrial loads, such as electric
arc furnaces and rolling mills, and to balance the real power drawn from the ac supply lines. These types of
heavy industrial loads are normally concentrated in one plant and served from one network terminal, and thus
can be handled by a local compensator connected to the same terminal. The second type of compensation is
related to voltage support of transmission lines at a given terminal in response to disturbances of both load
and  generation.  The  voltage  support  is  achieved  by  rapid  control  of  the  SVC  reactance  and  thus  its  reactive
power output. The main objectives of dynamic VAR compensation are to increase the stability limit of the ac
power  system,  to  decrease  terminal  voltage  ﬂuctuations  during  load  variations,  and  to  limit  overvoltages
subsequent to large disturbances. SVCs are essentially thyristor-controlled reactive power devices.
