Resultant force and torque replaces the effects of a system of forces acting on the movement of a rigid body. An interesting special case is a torque-free resultant, which can be found as follows:
Vector addition is used to find the net force;
Use the equation to determine the point of application with zero torque:

The diagram opposite illustrates simple graphical methods for finding the line of application of the resultant force of simple planar systems:

", the net force obtained is translated so that its line of application passes through the common intersection point. With respect to that point all torques are zero, so the torque of the resultant force

R





{\displaystyle \scriptstyle {\vec {F}}_{R}}
is equal to the sum of the torques of the actual forces.
The illustration in the middle of the diagram shows two parallel actual forces. After vector addition "at the location of

{\displaystyle \scriptstyle {\vec {F}}_{2}}
", the net force is translated to the appropriate line of application, where it becomes the resultant force








F

R





{\displaystyle \scriptstyle {\vec {F}}_{R}}
. The procedure is based on decomposition of all forces into components for which the lines of application (pale dotted lines) intersect at one point (the so-called pole, arbitrarily set at the right side of the illustration). Then the arguments from the previous case are applied to the forces and their components to demonstrate the torque relationships.
The rightmost illustration shows a couple, two equal but opposite forces for which the amount of the net force is zero, but they produce the net torque

is the distance between their lines of application. Since there is no resultant force, this torque can be [is?] described as "pure" torque.
