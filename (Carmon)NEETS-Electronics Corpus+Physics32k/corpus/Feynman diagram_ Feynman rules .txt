The diagrams are drawn according to the Feynman rules, which depend upon the interaction Lagrangian. For the QED interaction Lagrangian

describing the interaction of a fermionic field ψ with a bosonic gauge field Aμ, the Feynman rules can be formulated in coordinate space as follows:
Each integration coordinate xj is represented by a point (sometimes called a vertex);
A bosonic propagator is represented by a wiggly line connecting two points;
A fermionic propagator is represented by a solid line connecting two points;
A bosonic field

is represented by a wiggly line attached to the point xi;
A fermionic field ψ(xi) is represented by a solid line attached to the point xi with an arrow toward the point;
An anti-fermionic field ψ(xi) is represented by a solid line attached to the point xi with an arrow away from the point;
