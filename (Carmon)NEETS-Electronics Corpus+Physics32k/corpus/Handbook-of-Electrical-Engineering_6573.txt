where P is the received optical power, r is the detector’s unampliﬁed responsivity, G is the detector gain if an
APD is used, n accounts for the excess noise of the APD (usually between 2 and 3), B is the receiver’s bandwidth,
k is Boltzmann’s constant (k = 1.38 · 10–23 J/K), e is the magnitude of the charge on an electron (1.6 · 10–19
coulomb),  T  is  the  receiver’s  temperature  in  degrees  kelvin,  ID  is  the  detector’s  dark  current,  and  RL  is  the
resistance of the load resistor that follows the photodetector.
