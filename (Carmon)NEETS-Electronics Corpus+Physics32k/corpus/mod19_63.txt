In this situation, the immediate administration of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) by a rescuer 
using correct procedures greatly increases the chances of a victim's survival. To be effective, CPR must 
be started within 4 minutes of the onset of cardiac arrest. CPR consists of external heart compression and 
artificial ventilation. This compression is performed on the outside of the chest, and the lungs are 
ventilated either by mouth-to-mouth or mouth-to-nose techniques. The victim should be lying on a firm 
surface.
