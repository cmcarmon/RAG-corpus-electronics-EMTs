In your studies, you will learn about modulation as it applies to radio-frequency communications. To 
modulate is to impress the characteristics (intelligence) of one waveform onto a second waveform by 
varying the amplitude, frequency, phase, or other characteristics of the second waveform. First, however, 
you will review the characteristics and generation of a sine wave. This review will help you to better 
understand the principles of modulation. Then, an important principle called HETERODYNING (mixing 
two frequencies across a nonlinear impedance) will be studied and applied to modulation. Nonlinear 
impedance will be discussed in the heterodyning section. You will also study several methods of 
modulating a radio-frequency carrier. You will come to a better understanding of the demodulation 
principle by studying the various circuits used to demodulate a modulated carrier.
