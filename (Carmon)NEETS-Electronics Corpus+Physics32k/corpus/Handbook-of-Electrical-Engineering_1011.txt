Most of the model parameters for BSIM3 have physical signiÔ¨Åcance so they are obtained in the spirit of the
parameters for the level 2 and 3 models. The incorporation of temperature dependence is also easier in BSIM3
because  the  parameters  are  more  physical. All  this,  coupled  with  the  fact  that  about  30  parameters  exist  for
BSIM3 as compared to over 100 for BSIM2, makes BSIM3 a logical choice for analog design. However, BSIM3
is evolving, and shortcomings to the model may still exist that may be corrected in later revisions.
