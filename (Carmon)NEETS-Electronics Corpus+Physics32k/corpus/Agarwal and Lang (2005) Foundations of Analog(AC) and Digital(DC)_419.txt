Let vc and vb denote the voltages at nodes c and b, respectively. To find vc, let us follow
the path g → f → c. Accordingly, there is a 1-V increase in potential from g to f, and a
further −2-V ‘‘increase’’ from f to c resulting in an accumulated potential of −1 V at c.
Thus vc = −1 V.
Similarly, because the potential at node b is 4 V higher than that at node c, we get
