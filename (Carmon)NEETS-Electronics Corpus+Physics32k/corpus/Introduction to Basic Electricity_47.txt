A	resistive	circuit	is	a	kind	of	circuit	that	consists	of	nothing	but	a	series	of
resistors	to	complete	the	combo	of	electric	current	and	voltage	source.	If	viewed	in
a	chart,	it	is	noticeable	that	the	power	waveform	is	always	positive;	it	is	suggestive
the	power	in	a	circuit	is	always	dissipated,	and	is	never	returned	to	the	original
source.
It	is	important	to	note	that	the	frequency	of	the	power	in	a	circuit	should	not	be
equal	to	the	frequency	of	the	electric	current	and	voltage.	If	possible,	the	frequency
of	the	power	should	be	twice	as	high	as	that	of	the	electric	current	and	voltage.
This	unequal	frequency	distribution	grants	constant	change	within	a	system.
Since	it	is	made	up	of	resistors	and	does	not	include	transistors	and	capacitors,	a
resistive	circuit	is	rather	easier	to	analyze.	Understanding	the	electric	flow	within
the	circuit	(whether	in	an	AC	or	DC	system)	requires	a	straightforward	technique.
Therefore,	determining	the	flow	of	the	current	in	a	resistive	circuit	is	simple;	by
adhering	to	the	formula,	calculating	the	figure	is	easy.
