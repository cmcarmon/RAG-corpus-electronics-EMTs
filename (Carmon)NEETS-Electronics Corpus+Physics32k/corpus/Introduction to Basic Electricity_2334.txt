The amount of energy stored in a capacitor is in 
proportion to the size of the capacitor. The capaci-
tors used in classrooms are usually small and deliver 
only a small shock if discharged through the body. If 
a capacitor is large and charged with a high voltage, 
however, the shock can be fatal. Charged capacitors 
should be treated like any other voltage source. Use 
a commercial shorting stick or a screwdriver with 
an insulated handle and a lead attached to discharge 
capacitors.
