The vertical power bipolar junction transistor (BJT) has a
four-layer structure of alternating p-type and n-type doping
as shown in Figure 7.4. The transistor has three terminals
labeled collector, base, and emitter. The need for a large off-
state blocking voltage and high on-state current-carrying cap-
ability is responsible for the changes in structure over the
logic-level counterpart. The transistor is commonly operated
in a common emitter mode. The steady-state static I–V char-
acteristics of the power BJT are shown in Figure 7.5. The BJT is
turned on by injecting current in the base terminal and is a
current-controlled device. This causes electrons
to ﬂow
from the emitter to collector. The maximum collector current
for a given base current is determined by the current gain,
