Solderless breadboards, also called prototyping boards or circuit breadboards, 
make it a snap to build (and dismantle) temporary circuits (see Figure 15-1). 
These reusable rectangular plastic boards contain several hundred square 
sockets, or contact holes, into which you plug your components (for instance, 
resistors, capacitors, diodes, transistors, and integrated circuits). Groups 
of contact holes are electrically connected by flexible metal strips running 
underneath the surface. You poke a wire or lead into a hole and it makes con-
tact with the underlying metal. By plugging in components in just the right 
way and running wires from your breadboard to your power supply, you can 
build a working circuit without permanently bonding components together.
