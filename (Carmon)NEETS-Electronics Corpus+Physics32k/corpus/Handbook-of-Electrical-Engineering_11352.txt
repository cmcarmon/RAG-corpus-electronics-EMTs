Computerized Tomography
The basic concept of computerized tomography can be described by consideration of Fig. 116.1. An x-ray source
is  passed  through  an  aperture  to  produce  a  fan-shaped  beam  that  passes  through  the  body  of  interest  with
absorption along approximately parallel lines. The natural logarithm of the detected intensity will be the integral
of the linear attenuation coefÔ¨Åcient of the object along the ray directed from the source to the detector element.
If the source and the detector array are synchronously rotated about a point within the object, a number of
