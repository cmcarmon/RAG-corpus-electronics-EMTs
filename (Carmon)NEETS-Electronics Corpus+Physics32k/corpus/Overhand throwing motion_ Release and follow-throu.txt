Where the ball is released depends on the distance of the thrower's target; a farther target requires a higher release point and the same applies conversely. The purpose of the follow-through is to decelerate the throwing arm. Once the projectile is released the throwing arm keeps moving across the body. This rapid deceleration is actually the most violent part of the throwing motion, as the greatest amount of joint loading occurs at this stage. For professional baseball pitchers the leg opposite the stride leg also steps forward and squares the pitcher with his target.
