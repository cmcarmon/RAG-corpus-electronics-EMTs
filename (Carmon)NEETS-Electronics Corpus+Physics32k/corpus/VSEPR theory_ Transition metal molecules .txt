Many transition metal compounds have unusual geometries, which can be ascribed to ligand bonding interaction with the d subshell and to absence of valence shell lone pairs. Gillespie suggested that this interaction can be weak or strong. Weak interaction is dealt with by the Kepert model, while strong interaction produces bonding pairs that also occupy the respective antipodal points of the sphere. This is similar to predictions based on sd hybrid orbitals using the VALBOND theory. The repulsion of these bidirectional bonding pairs leads to a different prediction of shapes.

The Kepert model cannot explain the formation of square planar complexes or distorted structures.
