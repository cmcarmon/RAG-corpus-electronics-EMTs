After you’ve read all the safety warnings in this 
chapter, you may want to review this simple 
checklist of minimal safety requirements before 
you get started on an electronics project. Better 
yet,  you  can  make  a  copy  of  this  checklist, 
laminate it, and post it at your workbench as a 
reminder of the simple steps that can ensure 
your safety — and the well‐being of your elec-
tronics projects.
