The equation for viscous resistance or linear drag is appropriate for objects or particles moving through a fluid at relatively slow speeds where there is no turbulence (i.e. low Reynolds number,

<
1


{\displaystyle R_{e}<1}
). Note that purely laminar flow only exists up to Re = 0.1 under this definition. In this case, the force of drag is approximately proportional to velocity. The equation for viscous resistance is:

v




{\displaystyle \mathbf {F} _{d}=-b\mathbf {v} \,}

where:







b


{\displaystyle \mathbf {} b}
is a constant that depends on the properties of the fluid and the dimensions of the object, and





v



{\displaystyle \mathbf {v} }
is the velocity of the object
When an object falls from rest, its velocity will be

For the special case of small spherical objects moving slowly through a viscous fluid (and thus at small Reynolds number), George Gabriel Stokes derived an expression for the drag constant:

{\displaystyle b=6\pi \eta r\,}

where:







r


{\displaystyle \mathbf {} r}
is the Stokes radius of the particle, and






η


{\displaystyle \mathbf {} \eta }
is the fluid viscosity.
The resulting expression for the drag is known as Stokes' drag:

For example, consider a small sphere with radius

= 0.5 micrometre (diameter = 1.0 µm) moving through water at a velocity






v


{\displaystyle \mathbf {} v}
of 10 µm/s. Using 10−3 Pa·s as the dynamic viscosity of water in SI units, we find a drag force of 0.09 pN. This is about the drag force that a bacterium experiences as it swims through water.
