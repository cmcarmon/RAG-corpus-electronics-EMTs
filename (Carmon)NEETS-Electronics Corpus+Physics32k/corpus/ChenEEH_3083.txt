ANSI/IEEE C57.12.00 deﬁnes routine and optional test and
testing procedures for power transformers. The following are
listed as routine tests for transformers larger than 501 kVA:
winding resistance, winding turns ratio, phase–relationship
tests, polarity, angular displacements, phase sequence, no-
load loss and exciting current, load loss and impedance volt-
age,
low-frequency dielectric tests (applied voltage and in-
duced voltage), and leak test on a transformer tank.
