Stroboscopes generally have a high- and low-range switch. The typical low range is from 600 to 
3,600 rpm, and the upper range is from 3,600 to 15,000 rpm; there is a slight overlap in ranges to ensure 
reliable frequency coverage. In view of the limitation imposed by flasher tube life, the stroboscope should 
always be operated at a flashing rate that is as low as possible, consistent with the rotational speed of the 
observed part. If you should be required to operate this instrument over a long period of time, use a 
submultiple of the fundamental synchronous speed. The pattern will remain just as stationary, and the 
tube life will be greatly extended. In addition, the quality of the light is better at the lower ranges than at 
the upper end of the scale. Sometimes you will encounter a rotating or vibrating device that is moving 
faster (or slower) than the measuring range of the stroboscope will accommodate. Although such speeds 
can still be measured, you must use the multiple or submultiple synchronism points.
