The technical system requirements documented in the System Specification stay on mission level:
System functions and performances
Orbit
Launch vehicle
etc.
whereas the non-technical system (task) requirements
Cost and progress reporting
Documentation maintenance
etc.
are contained in the statement of work.
The customer (requirements) specification is answered by the contractor by a design-to specification.
For example, the requirement "Columbus shall be launched by the Space Shuttle." is detailed in the contractor system specification "Columbus shall be a cylindrical pressurized module with max. length of 6.9 meters and 4.5 meters diameter as agreed in the Shuttle/Columbus ICD."
