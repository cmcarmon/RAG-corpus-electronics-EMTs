Two conditions must be met in a circuit for heterodyning to occur. First, at least two different 
frequencies must be applied to the circuit. Second, these signals must be applied to a nonlinear 
impedance. These two conditions will result in new frequencies (sum and difference) being produced. 
Any one of the frequencies can be selected by placing a frequency-selective device (such as a tuned tank 
circuit) in series with the nonlinear impedance in the circuit.
