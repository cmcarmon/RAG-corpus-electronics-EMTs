When the voltage across the grids is negative, as shown in figure 2-5B, electron 1 crossing the gap at 
that time is slowed. Figure 2-5C shows the potential across the gap at 0 volts; electron 2 is not affected. 
Electron 3 enters the gap (figure 2-5D) when the voltage across the gap is positive and its velocity is 
increased. The combined effect is shown in figure 2-5E. All of the electrons in the group have been 
bunched closer together.
