optical fibers. Fiber optic connectors sometimes resemble familiar electrical plugs and sockets. Systems
may also divide or combine optical signals between fibers. Fiber optic couplers distribute or combine
optical signals between fibers. Couplers can distribute an optical signal from a single fiber into several
fibers. Couplers may also combine optical signals from several fibers into one fiber.
