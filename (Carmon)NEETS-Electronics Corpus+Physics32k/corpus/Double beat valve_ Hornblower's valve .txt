It was invented around 1800 by Jonathan Hornblower. His valve is in the form of a hollow cylinder provided with two seats of nearly equal diameter, at A and B in the diagram. The cylinder is connected to the actuating rod by a web. The force required to lift the valve depends on the difference between diameters D and d: the smaller this difference can be made, the less the force necessary to open the valve. In Hornblower's valve, the steam flows past seat B only. In later developments of the valve, the central portion is waisted so that the flow can pass at A as well, so increasing the valve opening area for the same amount of lift.
