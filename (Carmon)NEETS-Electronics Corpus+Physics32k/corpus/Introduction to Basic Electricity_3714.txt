As the sine wave changes from the positive half 
cycle to the negative half cycle, diode D2 is cut off 
 because capacitor C2 holds diode D2 reverse biased. 
Capacitor C2 discharges through the load, holding the 
voltage across the load constant. Therefore, it also acts 
as a filter capacitor. Capacitor C2 recharges only during 
the positive cycle of the input signal, resulting in a rip-
ple frequency of 60 hertz (hence the name “half-wave 
voltage doubler”). One disadvantage of the half-wave 
voltage doubler is that it is difficult to filter because of 
the 60-hertz ripple frequency. Another disadvantage is 
that capacitor C2 must have a voltage rating of at least 
twice the peak value of the AC input signal.
