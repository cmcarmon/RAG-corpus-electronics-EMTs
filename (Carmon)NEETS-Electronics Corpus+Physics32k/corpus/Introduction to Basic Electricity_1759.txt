In 1827, George Ohm first observed Ohm’s	law, 
or  the  relationship  among  current,  voltage,  and 
 resistance. Ohm’s law states that the current in an elec-
tric circuit is directly proportional to the voltage and 
 inversely proportional to the resistance in a circuit. 
This may be expressed as follows:
