5The vector x is said to be a ﬁxed point of operator T if T x = x.
6The sequence {yn} is said to converge weakly to y if <yn – y, z > converges to zero for every z ˛  X as n becomes unbounded.
7The sequence {yn} is said to converge strongly to y if ** yn – y ** approaches zero as n becomes unbounded.
