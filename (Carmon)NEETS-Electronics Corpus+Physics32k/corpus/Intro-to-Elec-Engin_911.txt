The characteristics of most interest to power engineers are voltage regulation and efﬁciency. The
voltage regulation of a transformer is a measure of the change in the magnitude of the secondary
voltage as the current changes from no load to full load while the primary voltage is held ﬁxed.
This is deﬁned as
