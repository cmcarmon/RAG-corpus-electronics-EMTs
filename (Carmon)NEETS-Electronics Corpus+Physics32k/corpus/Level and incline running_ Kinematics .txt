Kinematics of running is concerned with describing the motion of the body and in particular the joint angles realized at the hip, knee, and ankle. In level running the hip reaches maximal flexion prior to the end of the swing phase, followed by extension as the leg moves to meet the ground. Throughout stance phase the hip is extending until toe-off to provide propulsion. Knee joint angle displays a biphasic plot. At initial ground contact the knee flexes to lower the body followed by extending to propel the body. Maximal extension is reached at toe-off, after which the knee again flexes to provide clearance. At the ankle maximal plantarflexion is reached at toe-off and is followed by dorsiflexion until mid-swing when the ankle of dorsiflexion remains nearly constant until initial ground contact is made and further dorsiflexion occurs to lower and support the body. In the second half of the stance phase the ankle begin rapid plantar flexion until toe-off.
A number of studies have been performed examining the kinematics of incline running. Swanson and Caldwell (2000) found greater joint flexion at all three joints during initial foot-strike. Also noted was an increase in extensor range of motion and angular velocity at all three joints during push off. Conversely, Klein et al. had found no changes in joint angles when running on an incline versus level surfaces. However, his subjects ran at a speed equal to anaerobic threshold (average of 3.5 meters/second) that was significantly slower than the subjects in Swanson and Caldwellâ€™s study (4.5 meters/second). Also, grade was 5% in contrast to 30%.
