In semiconductor materials, E(k) dependence is more complex
(see Figure 6.8). Near the lowest point of the conduction band,
the dependence of the electron energy on the wave vector can
still be approximated by a parabolic function similar to that for
an electron in free space (see equation 6.3 and Figure 6.8). The
curvature of this dependence, however, is usually quite differ-
ent from that for an electron in free space. Moreover, different
crystallographic directions are not equivalent, and this curva-
ture may depend on direction. These features can be accounted
for by introducing an inverse effective mass tensor with com-
ponents deÔ¨Åned as follows:
