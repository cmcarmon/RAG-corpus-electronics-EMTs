Nanophotonic coherent imagers (NCI) are image sensors that determine both the appearance and distance of an imaged scene at each pixel. It uses an array of LIDARs (scanning laser beams) to gather this information about size and distance, using an optical concept called coherence (wherein waves of the same frequency align perfectly.)
NCIs can capture 3D images of objects with sufficient accuracy to permit the creation of high resolution replicas using 3D printing technology.
The detection of both intensity and relative delay enables applications such as high-resolution 3D reflective and transmissive imaging as well as index contrast imaging.
