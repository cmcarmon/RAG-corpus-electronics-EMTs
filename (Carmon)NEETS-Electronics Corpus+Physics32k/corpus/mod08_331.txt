When an output signal is taken between the two output terminals of the amplifier (as shown by the
phantom connections, resistor, and signal), the combined output signal is twice as great in amplitude as
either signal at output number one or output number two. (This is because output number one and output
number two are 180 degrees out of phase with each other.) When the input signals are 180 degrees out of
phase, the amplitude of the combined output signal is equal to the amplitude of one input signal
multiplied by two times the gain of the amplifier.
