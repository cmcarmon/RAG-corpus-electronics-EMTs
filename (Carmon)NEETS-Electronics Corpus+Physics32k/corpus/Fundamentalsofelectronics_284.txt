We need to detail the exponential nonlinearity to determine how the circuit distorts the input voltage
waveform. We can of course numerically solve the circuit shown in Figure 3.47 to determine the output
voltage when the input is a sinusoid. To learn more, let’s express this equation graphically. We plot each
term as a function of vout for various values of the input voltage vin; where they intersect gives us the output
voltage. The left side, the current through the output resistor, does not vary itself with vin, and thus we
have a ﬁxed straight line. As for the right side, which expresses the diode’s v-i relation, the point at which
the curve crosses the vout axis gives us the value of vin. Clearly, the two curves will always intersect just once
for any value of vin, and for positive vin the intersection occurs at a value for vout smaller than vin. This
reduction is smaller if the straight line has a shallower slope, which corresponds to using a bigger output
resistor. For negative vin, the diode is reverse-biased and the output voltage equals −RI0.
