The horizontal and vertical position controls are 
also rotary controls, and they allow the electron beam 
to be positioned anywhere on the face of the CRT. 
 Initially, they are set so that the electron beam sweeps 
across the center of the CRT. They are then adjusted to 
place the electron beam in a position to measure am-
plitude and time by its placement on a graticule.
