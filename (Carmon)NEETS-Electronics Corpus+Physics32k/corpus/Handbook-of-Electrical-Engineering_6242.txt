Interlaced Scanning Fields
Because of the half-line offset for the start of the beam return to the top of the raster and for the start of the
second ﬁeld, the lines of the second ﬁeld lie in-between the lines of the ﬁrst ﬁeld. Thus, the lines of the two
are interlaced. The two interlaced ﬁelds constitute a single television frame. Figure 69.16 shows a frame scan
with interlacing of the lines of two ﬁelds.
