The frequency discriminator controls the varicap in this receiver. A varicap is used to keep the IF
stable. You may want to review varicap theory in chapter 3 of NEETS, Module 7, Introduction to Solid-
State Devices and Power Supplies at this point. The varicap application here produces an apparent
reactance, which is included in the oscillator frequency control circuitry. For example, let’s assume the IF
is 455 kilohertz and the local oscillator (lo) is tracking below the incoming station. When the lo output
decreases slightly in frequency, the IF will rise. This causes the output of the discriminator to increase the
capacitive reactance of the varicap, which increases the oscillator frequency to the desired value. Now
let’s assume the lo output increases. The IF will then decrease. This causes the discriminator output to
decrease the capacitive reactance of the varicap. This will cause the oscillator frequency to decrease.
