The parametric frequency converter operates in the same manner as the parametric amplifier except 
that the sideband frequencies are not reapplied to the varactor. Therefore, the output is one or both of the 
sideband frequencies and is not the same as the input frequency. The output frequency is determined by 
the cavity used as an output. For example, the idler cavity in figure 2-47 could be replaced by a cavity that 
is resonant at the upper-sideband frequency (22 gigahertz) to produce an upper-sideband parametric 
up-converter. Since input and output signals are at different frequencies, the parametric frequency 
converter does not require a ferrite circulator. However, a ferrite isolator is used to isolate the converter 
from changes in source impedance.
