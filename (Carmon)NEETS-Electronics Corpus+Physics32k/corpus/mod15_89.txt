Figure 1-14 illustrates a cross section of a synchro transmitter and shows the effective voltage 
induced in one stator coil as the rotor is turned to different positions. The turns ratios in synchros may 
vary widely, depending upon design and application, but there is commonly a 2.2:1 stepdown between the 
rotor and a single coil. Thus, when 115 volts is applied to the rotor, the highest value of effective voltage 
induced in any one stator coil is 52 volts. The maximum induced voltage occurs each time there is 
maximum magnetic coupling between the rotor and the stator coil (views A, C, and E). The effective 
voltage induced in the secondary winding is approximately equal to the product of the effective voltage 
on the primary, the secondary-to-primary turns ratio, and the magnetic coupling between primary and 
secondary. Therefore, because the primary voltage and the turns ratio are constant, it is commonly said 
that the secondary voltage varies with the angle between the rotor and the stator.
