Higher velocity airflow can be generated if more ions are generated by the ionization process; a greater density of ions would mean that a greater number of neutral molecules are pushed along. However the maximum voltage which can be applied to the electrodes is limited by the breakdown strength of the air â€“ too high a voltage would result in a spark, which is a sudden discharge of electrical energy (much like lightning), instead of a corona. To avoid this a larger number of electrodes are required. Again, finding the optimal geometry will be the key determinant of success, as too many electrodes too close together tend to diminish the corona effect.
