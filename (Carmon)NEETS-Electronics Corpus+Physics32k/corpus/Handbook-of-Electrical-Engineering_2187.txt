The literature in this ﬁeld is voluminous. We decided to limit the references to text books for an engineering
audience, with different levels of sophistication. Zurada is the most accessible text, Haykin the most compre-
hensive.  Kung  provides  interesting  applications  of  both  PCA  networks  and  nonlinear  signal  processing  and
system identiﬁcation. Bishop concentrates on the design of pattern classiﬁers.
