c i r c u i t The circuit shown in Figure 14.24 can be used as a metal detector. To
do so, the inductor is wound as a large flat coil. In the presence of nearby metal, the
inductance of the coil changes, and so vOUT changes as well. Suppose that we can
detect a 0.1-mV change in the amplitude of vOUT in the sinusoidal steady state. What
is the corresponding minimum detectable change in inductance, and how should the
frequency Ï‰ be chosen to maximize the sensitivity of the metal detector?
