The most precise is the global positioning system (GPS), a network of 24 satellites and a half-dozen ground
stations for monitoring and control. A vehicle derives its three-dimensional position and velocity from ranging
signals at 1.575 GHz received from four or more satellites (military users also receive 1.227 GHz). The former
Soviet Union deployed a similar system, called GLONASS. GPS offers better than 100-m ranging errors to civil
users  and  15-m  ranging  errors  to  military  users.  Simple  receivers  were  available  for  less  than  $300  in  1997.
They  are  used  on  highways,  in  low-rise  cities,  at  sea,  in  aircraft,  and  in  low-orbit  spacecraft.  GPS  provides
continuous  worldwide  navigation  for  the  ﬁrst  time  in  history.  It  will  make  dead  reckoning  unnecessary  on
many vehicles and will reduce the cost of most navigation systems. Figure 109.5 is an artist’s drawing of a GPS
Block 2F spacecraft, scheduled for launch in the year 2002.
