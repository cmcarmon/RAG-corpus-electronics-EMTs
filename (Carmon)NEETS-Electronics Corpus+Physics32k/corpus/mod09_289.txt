The Colpitts oscillator is very similar to the shunt-fed Hartley oscillator, except that two capacitors 
are used in the tank circuit instead of a tapped coil (figure 2-15). The Hartley oscillator has a tap between 
two coils, while the Colpitts has a tap between two capacitors. You can change the frequency of the 
Colpitts either by varying the inductance of the coil or by varying the capacitance of the two capacitors in 
the tank circuit. Notice that no coupling capacitor is used between the tank circuit and the base of Q1. 
Capacitors C1 and C2 of the tank circuit are in parallel with the input and the output interelement 
capacitance (capacitance between emitter, base, and collector) of the transistor. Thus the input and the 
output capacitive effect can be minimized on the tank circuit and better frequency stability can be 
obtained than with the Armstrong or the Hartley oscillator.
