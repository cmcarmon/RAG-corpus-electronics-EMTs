Node analysis as described here does not work for circuits that contain floating
independent voltage sources such as the one shown in Figure 3.20. A floating
independent voltage source is a voltage source that has neither terminal con-
nected to ground, neither directly nor through one or more other independent
voltage sources. The reason node analysis does not work is that the element
law for an independent voltage source does not relate its branch current to its
branch voltage. Therefore, it is not possible to complete Step 3 of node analysis
if the circuit contains a floating independent voltage source. In this case, it is
necessary to modify the node analysis slightly.
