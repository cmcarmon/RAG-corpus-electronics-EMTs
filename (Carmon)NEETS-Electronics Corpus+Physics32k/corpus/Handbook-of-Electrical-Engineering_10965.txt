The threshold current needed for excitation is highly dependent on its duration and waveshape. A common
format  for  representing  the  response  of  a  nerve  is  through  strength-duration  curves,  i.e.,  the  plot  of  the
threshold  of  excitation  versus  the  duration  of  the  stimulating  current.  We  can  determine  the  threshold  of
excitation by “titrating” the stimulus current between a threshold and no-threshold condition.
