The minimum gap between the roller and the housing determines the maximum squeeze applied on the tubing. The amount of squeeze applied to the tubing affects pumping performance and the tube life - more squeezing decreases the tubing life dramatically, while less squeezing can cause the pumped medium to slip back, especially in high pressure pumping, and decreases the efficiency of the pump dramatically and the high velocity of the slip back typically causes premature failure of the hose. Therefore, this amount of squeeze becomes an important design parameter.
The term "occlusion" is used to measure the amount of squeeze. It is either expressed as a percentage of twice the wall thickness, or as an absolute amount of the wall that is squeezed.
Let
y = occlusion
g = minimum gap between the roller and the housing
t = wall thickness of the tubing
Then
y = 2t - g (when expressed as the absolute amount of squeeze)
y = (2t - g) / (2t) Ã— 100 (when expressed as a percentage of twice the wall thickness)
The occlusion is typically 10 to 20%, with a higher occlusion for a softer tube material and a lower occlusion for a harder tube material.
Thus for a given pump, the most critical tubing dimension becomes the wall thickness. An interesting point here is that the inside diameter of the tubing is not an important design parameter for the suitability of the tubing for the pump. Therefore, it is common for more than one ID be used with a pump, as long as the wall thickness remains the same.
