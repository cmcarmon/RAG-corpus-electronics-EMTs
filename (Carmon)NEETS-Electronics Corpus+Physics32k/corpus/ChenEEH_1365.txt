The key idea in BSP is to decouple communication from
synchronization in the programming model. A parallel system
is described as a collection of processors, each with its own
local memory, and the processors are connected by a commu-
nication network capable of efÔ¨Åcient barrier synchronization.
A barrier is a method to separate two phases of a computation
to ensure that messages generated in the two phases are not
mixed together.
