It has been experimentally proven that an electron has a magnetic field about it along with an electric
field. The effectiveness of the magnetic field of an atom is determined by the number of electrons
spinning in each direction. If an atom has equal numbers of electrons spinning in opposite directions, the
magnetic fields surrounding the electrons cancel one another, and the atom is unmagnetized. However, if
more electrons spin in one direction than another, the atom is magnetized. An atom with an atomic
number of 26, such as iron, has 26 protons in the nucleus and 26 revolving electrons orbiting its nucleus.
If 13 electrons are spinning in a clockwise direction and 13 electrons are spinning in a counterclockwise
direction, the opposing magnetic fields will be neutralized. When more than 13 electrons spin in either
direction, the atom is magnetized. An example of a magnetized atom of iron is shown in figure 1-12.
