It is common in particle physics, where mass and energy are often interchanged, to use eV/c2, where eV (electronvolt) is the kinetic energy of an electron accelerated over one volt (1.6×10−19 joules), c is the speed of light in a vacuum (from E = mc2). This definition is intuitive for a linear particle accelerator when accelerating electrons.

1 amu = 931.46 MeV/c2

Even more common is to use a system of natural units with c set to 1, and simply use eV as a unit of mass.
