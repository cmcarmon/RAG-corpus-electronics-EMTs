In the preceding equation , q is the total amount of charge within the closed
surface. If we choose the closed surface to envelop the entire filament as depicted
in Figure A.8, then q will be the total charge within the enclosed volume. Let
us assume that the faces of the filament at the terminals x and y are the only
entry and exit points for the current, and that there is no charge outside the
element. It is clear from the preceding equation that the current into the element
will not equal the current out of the element in the presence of a time-varying
total charge within the element. Thus, it makes no sense to define a current
‘‘through’’ the element in the presence of a time-varying total internal charge.
