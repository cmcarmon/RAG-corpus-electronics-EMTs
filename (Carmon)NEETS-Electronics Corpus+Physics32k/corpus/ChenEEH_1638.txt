A direct extension of the JPEG standard to video compres-
sion known as motion JPEG (MJPEG) is obtained by the JPEG
encoding of each individual picture in a video sequence. This
approach is used when random access to each picture is essen-
tial, such as in video editing applications. The MJPEG com-
pressed video yields data rates in the range of 8 to 10 Mbps.
