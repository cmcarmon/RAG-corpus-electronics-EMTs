The swept-frequency technique can effectively determine the frequency response of an amplifier or 
filter and is useful in the alignment or bandwidth determination of an IF or rf stage. The test equipment 
permits direct visual readout on the crt of the spectrum analyzer. The spectrum analyzer can also be 
connected to an X-Y chart recorder if a permanent record or print is desired. Figure 5-29 shows a 
spectrum analyzer crt display of the frequency response of a multicoupler. The tracking generator used 
must be capable of sweeping the desired frequency range of the device under test.
