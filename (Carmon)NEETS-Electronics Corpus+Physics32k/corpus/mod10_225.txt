All the energy supplied to the induction field is returned to the antenna by the collapsing E and H 
fields. No energy from the induction field is radiated from the antenna. Therefore, the induction field is 
considered a local field and plays no part in the transmission of electromagnetic energy. The induction 
field represents only the stored energy in the antenna and is responsible only for the resonant effects that 
the antenna reflects to the generator.
