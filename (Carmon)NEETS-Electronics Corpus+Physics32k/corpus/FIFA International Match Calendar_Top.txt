The FIFA International Match Calendar (sometimes abbreviated as the FIFA Calendar) is an outline agreement between FIFA, the six continental football confederations, European Club Association and FIFPro.
The match calendar sets out which dates can be used for 'Official matches' and 'Friendly matches'. The current dates are five: late March, early June, early September, early October and early November. It also determines when international competitions such as the AFC Asian Cup, Copa Am√©rica, CONCACAF Gold Cup, UEFA European Championship, FIFA Confederations Cup and the FIFA World Cup can take place. The OFC Nations Cup is not listed on the international match calendar.
Official matches have a release period of 4 days, which means that players can take up to 4 days away from club duties to partake in national team duties. If a player participates in an official match on another continent than his club's, the release period is 5 days. Friendly matches are deemed less important and the release period is 48 hours.
FIFA insist that official and friendly matches should take precedence over domestic matches. However, they state that international friendlies that take place outside the designated dates do not.
