Dopant-Ion Control
As devices are made smaller, the precise positioning of dopant inside the device is critical. At high temperatures
during processing, dopant ions can move. For example, source and drain dopants can enter the channel region,
causing position dependence of threshold voltage. Similar problems occur in isolation structures that separate
one device from another [Pimbley et al., 1989; Einspruch and Gildenblat, 1989; Wolf, 1995].
