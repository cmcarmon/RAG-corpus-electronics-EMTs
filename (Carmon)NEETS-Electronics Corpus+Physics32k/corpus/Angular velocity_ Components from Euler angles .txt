The components of the angular velocity pseudovector were first calculated by Leonhard Euler using his Euler angles and an intermediate frame made out of the intermediate frames of the construction:
One axis of the reference frame (the precession axis)
The line of nodes of the moving frame respect the reference frame (nutation axis)
One axis of the moving frame (the intrinsic rotation axis)
Euler proved that the projections of the angular velocity pseudovector over these three axes was the derivative of its associated angle (which is equivalent to decomposing the instant rotation in three instantaneous Euler rotations). Therefore:

{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\omega }}={\dot {\alpha }}{\mathbf {u} }_{1}+{\dot {\beta }}{\mathbf {u} }_{2}+{\dot {\gamma }}{\mathbf {u} }_{3}}

This basis is not orthonormal and it is difficult to use, but now the velocity vector can be changed to the fixed frame or to the moving frame with just a change of bases. For example, changing to the mobile frame:

are unit vectors for the frame fixed in the moving body. This example has been made using the Z-X-Z convention for Euler angles.
