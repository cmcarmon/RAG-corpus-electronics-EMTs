From Fig. 4.12,  
 
Hence the power factor of a series a.c. circuit can 
be found from the cosine of the phase angle. 
 
Example 4.12 
 
A choke (a form of inductor) having an inductance 
of 150 mH and resistance of 250 F is connected to 
a 115 V 400 Hz a.c. supply. Determine the power 
factor of the choke and the current taken from the 
supply. 
 
Solution 
 
First we must find the reactance of the inductor,  
 
XL = 20 × 400 × 0.15 = 376.8 F
We can now determine the power factor from:
