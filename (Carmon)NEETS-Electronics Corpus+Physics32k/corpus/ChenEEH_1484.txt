With multiprocessors and computer networks in the early
1980s, operating systems began to manage the resources of
multiple computers at once. Two early examples are the StarOS
and Medusa operating systems for the CM* (pronounced ‘‘CM
star’’) machine, a multicomputer consisting of several dozen
individual computers linked by a special network (Jones et al.,
1979; Ousterhout et al., 1980). Established, single-machine
operating systems, such as UNIX and DEC’S VMS, evolved
to accommodate networks of computers. Such operating
systems typically support standards for accessing ﬁles on
remote servers from any machine in a network. SUN’s Net-
work File System (NFS) was one of the ﬁrst widely available
UNIX-based ﬁle systems that provided a single ﬁlename space
on top of a network of servers and workstations (Sandberg
et al., 1985). Carnegie-Mellon’s Andrew system provides a
UNIX-based network ﬁle system that spans more than 5,000
computers around the campus; it allows users to access ﬁles
without having to know their locations, and it improves per-
