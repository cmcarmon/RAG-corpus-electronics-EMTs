Pulse-amplitude modulation is the simplest form of pulse modulation. It is generated in much the
same manner as analog-amplitude modulation. The timing pulses are applied to a pulse amplifier in which
the gain is controlled by the modulating waveform. Since these variations in amplitude actually represent
the signal, this type of modulation is basically a form of AM. The only difference is that the signal is now
in the form of pulses. This means that pam has the same built-in weaknesses as any other AM signal -
high susceptibility to noise and interference. The reason for susceptibility to noise is that any interference
in the transmission path will either add to or subtract from any voltage already in the circuit (signal
voltage). Thus, the amplitude of the signal will be changed. Since the amplitude of the voltage represents
the signal, any unwanted change to the signal is considered a SIGNAL DISTORTION. For this reason,
pam is not often used. When pam is used, the pulse train is used to frequency modulate a carrier for
transmission. Techniques of pulse modulation other than pam have been developed to overcome problems
of noise interference. The following sections will discuss other types of pulse modulation.
