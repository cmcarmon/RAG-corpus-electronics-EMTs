The photosensitive materials most commonly used to produce a photoelectric voltage are various
compounds of silver oxide or copper oxide. A complete device which operates on the photoelectric
principle is referred to as a "photoelectric cell." There are many different sizes and types of photoelectric
cells in use, and each serves the special purpose for which it is designed. Nearly all, however, have some
of the basic features of the photoelectric cells shown in figure 1-22.
