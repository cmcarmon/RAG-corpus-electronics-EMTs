The ﬁltered visual and aural outputs are fed to a hybrid diplexer where the two signals are combined to feed
the antenna. For installations that require dual-antenna feedlines, a hybrid combiner with quadrature-phased
outputs  is  used.  Depending  upon  the  design  and  operating  power,  the  color-notch  ﬁlter,  aural  and  visual
harmonic ﬁlters, and diplexer may be combined into a single mechanical unit.
