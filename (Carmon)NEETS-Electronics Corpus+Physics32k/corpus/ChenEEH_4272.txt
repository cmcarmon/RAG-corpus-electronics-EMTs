One way of getting around this interference is to put a time
limit on the system. The system will be designed to receive,
treat, and process a signal within a certain time limit. After the
time limit has expired, the system ignores signals. The sensi-
tivity of the system depends on how far it processes the multi-
path frequencies. Even at
these
multipath signals cause problems.
