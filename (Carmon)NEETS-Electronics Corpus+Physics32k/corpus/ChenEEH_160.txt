Let us now consider any one of the above network functions
and denote it by the letter F. The function will be the ratio of
two polynomials in the variables s, N(s), and D(s). If we use a
root-Ô¨Ånding method, we can also get the poles, pi, and zeros,
zi. As a result, for a general network function, we can use one
of the two following forms:
