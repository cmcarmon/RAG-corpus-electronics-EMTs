The power delivered to the basic linear resistive, inductive, and capacitive elements is obtained by inserting
the  v-i  relationships  into  this  expression.  Then,  using  the  relationship  between  power  and  energy  (power  as
the time derivative of energy and energy, therefore, as the integral of power), the energy stored in the capacitor
and inductor is also obtained:
