. Declarative versus procedural: Declarative models de-
scribe relationships between entities. They are very general,
but can lead to complex and inefﬁcient reasoning algo-
rithms. Procedural models are more appropriate when the
knowledge contains a strong element of directionality.
They tend to be highly specialized to a certain task or
situation and can efﬁciently derive outputs for inputs.
