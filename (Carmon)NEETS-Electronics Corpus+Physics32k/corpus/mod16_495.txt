The DIFFERENTIAL VOLTMETER provides extremely accurate voltage measurements and is a
highly reliable piece of precision test equipment. Its general function is to compare an unknown voltage
with a known internal reference voltage and to indicate the difference in their values. The differential
voltmeter in common use in the Navy today is the model 893A (figure 4-14).
