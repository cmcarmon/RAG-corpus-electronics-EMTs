Some autoranging multimeters have a manual range override feature. The 
multimeter shown in the photo on the right in Figure 16-5 contains a button 
labeled Range which, when pressed, steps through five manual range options. 
You have to carefully interpret the display to determine which range youâ€™ve 
selected.
