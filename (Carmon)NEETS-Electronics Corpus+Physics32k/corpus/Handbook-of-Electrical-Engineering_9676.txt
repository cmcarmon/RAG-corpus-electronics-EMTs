Message authentication scheme: A scheme to generate keys so that signing messages and authenticating the
validity of signatures can be executed efﬁciently when knowing the key; but without the key, it is infeasible
to falsely authenticate a new message even when given authentication tags to messages of one’s choice.
NP-sets: The set S is in NP if there exists a polynomial-time recognizable binary relation RS and a polynomial
ᐉ so that x∈S if and only if there exists y so that |y| ≤ ᐉ(|x|) and (x, y) ∈ RS. Such a y is called an NP-
witness to x∈S.
