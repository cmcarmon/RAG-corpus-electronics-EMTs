This relation tells us that in 2Dt , a numerical value can propa-
D along the grid diagonal. We can show that

this upper bound on ~vvp is intuitively correct given the local
nature of the spatial differences used in the Yee algorithm.
Consider two nearest neighbor ﬁeld points Pi, j and Piþ1, jþ1
along a grid diagonal and how a sudden change at Pi, j could
be communicated to Piþ1, jþ1. Now, a basic principle is that the
Yee algorithm can communicate ﬁeld data only along Carte-
sian (x and y) grid lines and not along grid diagonals. Thus, at
the minimum, 1Dt would be needed to transfer any part of the
ﬁeld perturbation at Pi, j over a distance of 1D in the x direc-
tion to Piþ1, j. Then, a second Dt would be needed, at the
minimum, to transfer any part of the resulting ﬁeld pertur-
bation at Piþ1, j over a distance of 1D in the y direction to
reach Piþ1, jþ1. Because the distance between Pi, j and Piþ1, jþ1
D, the maximum effective velocity of signal transmission
is

D=2Dt . By this reasoning, we see
between the two points is

that ~vvp, max is an inherent property of the FDTD grid.
