Equation 11.37 provides a reasonable ﬁrst-order estimate of
the input impedance of the patch antenna near resonance.
Note that there are many other simple models that also provide
a ﬁrst-order estimate of the input impedance. Often, the de-
signer must either fabricate and perform measurements or
obtain a full-wave solution to the structure using an electro-
magnetic (EM) simulator to achieve accurate design data for
the antenna. This simple model, however, provides a useful
starting place for the design.
