pump, is a spring‚Äêloaded vacuum you can use to remove a solder joint 
or excess solder in your circuit. To use it, melt the solder that you want 
to remove, quickly position the solder sucker over the molten blob, and 
activate it to suck up the solder. Alternatively, you can use a solder (or 
desoldering) wick or braid, which is a flat, woven copper wire that you 
place over unwanted solder and apply heat to. When the solder reaches 
its melting point, it adheres to the copper wire, which you then remove 
and dispose of.
