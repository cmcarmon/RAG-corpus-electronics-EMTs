Through its instant communication V2X allows road safety applications such as (non-exhaustive list):
Forward collision warning
Lane change warning/blind spot warning
Emergency Electric Brake Light Warning
Intersection Movement Assist
Emergency Vehicle Approaching
Road Works Warning
Platooning
The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s (NHTSA) report “Vehicle-to-Vehicle Communications: Readiness of V2V Technology for Application“ lists the initial use cases envisioned for the US. European standardisation body ETSI and SAE published standards on what they see as use cases. Early use cases focus on road safety and efficiency.
In the medium term V2X is perceived as a key enabler for autonomous driving, assuming it would be allowed to intervene into the actual driving. In that case vehicles would be able to join platoons, the way HGVs do.
