When a physical object maintains the same density and is scaled up, its volume and mass are increased by the cube of the multiplier while its surface area only increases by the square of said multiplier. This would mean that when the larger version of the object is accelerated at the same rate as the original, more pressure would be exerted on the surface of the larger object.
Let us consider a simple example of a body of mass, M, having an acceleration, a, and surface area, A, of the surface upon which the accelerating force is acting. The force due to acceleration,



F
=
M
a


{\displaystyle F=Ma}
and the thrust pressure,



T
=


F
A


=
M


a
A




{\displaystyle T={\frac {F}{A}}=M{\frac {a}{A}}}
.
Now, let us consider the object be exaggerated by a multiplier factor = x so that it has a new mass,




M
′

=

x

3


M


{\displaystyle M'=x^{3}M}
, and the surface upon which the force is acting has a new surface area,




A
′

=

2


A


{\displaystyle A'=x^{2}A}
.
The new force due to acceleration




F

{\displaystyle F'=x^{3}Ma}
and the resulting thrust pressure,

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}T'&={\frac {F'}{A'}}\\&={\frac {x^{3}}{x^{2}}}\times M{\frac {a}{A}}\\&=x\times M{\frac {a}{A}}\\&=x\times T\\\end{aligned}}}

Thus, just scaling up the size of an object, keeping the same material of construction (density), and same acceleration, would increase the thrust by the same scaling factor. This would indicate that the object would have less ability to resist stress and would be more prone to collapse while accelerating.
This is why large vehicles perform poorly in crash tests and why there are limits to how high buildings can be built. Similarly, the larger an object is, the less other objects would resist its motion, causing its deceleration.
