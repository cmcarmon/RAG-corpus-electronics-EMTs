Figure 6.7 shows the secondary voltage  waveform 
together with the voltage developed across RL with 
and  without  C1 present. This gives rise to a small 
variation  in  the  d.c.  output  voltage  (known  as 
ripple).  Since  ripple  is  undesirable  we  must  take 
additional  precautions  to  reduce  it.  One  obvious 
method  of  reducing  the  amplitude  of  the  ripple  is
