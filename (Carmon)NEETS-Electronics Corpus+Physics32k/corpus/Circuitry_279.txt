Practical investigation  
 
Objective 
 
To  obtain 
transfer 
characteristic  and  small-signal  current  gain  for 
three different NPN bipolar junction transistors. 
 
Components and test equipment 
Breadboard,  digital  or  analogue  meters  with  d.c. 
current ranges, 9 V d.c. power supply (or battery), 
three  different  NPN 
transistors  (e.g.  2N3904, 
BC548,  BFY50,  2N2222),  test  leads,  connecting  
wire.
