which is a ﬁrst-order ordinary differential equation with constant coefﬁcients. Note that the highest
derivative in Equation (3.2.2) is of ﬁrst order, and the coefﬁcients 1 and R/L are independent of
time t. Equation (3.2.2) is also linear since the unknown i(t) and any of its derivatives are not
raised to a power other than unity or do not appear as products of each other. Let us then consider
a general form of a linear, ﬁrst-order ordinary differential equation with constant coefﬁcients,
