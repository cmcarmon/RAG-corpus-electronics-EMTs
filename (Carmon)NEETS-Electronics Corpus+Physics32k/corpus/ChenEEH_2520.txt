narrow-band matching scheme with very limited use because
of a low degree of ï¬‚exibility in the impedance choice and
matchable area on the Smith chart. The two-section trans-
former as shown in Figure 7.10(B) can overcome this problem
to some degree. Still, the useful bandwidth is relatively narrow
for most practical applications.
