Much of the ongoing research on main memory involves improving the bandwidth from the memory system
without greatly increasing the number of banks. Multiple banks are expensive, particularly with the large and
growing capacity of modern DRAM chips. Rambus [Rambus Inc., 1992] and Ramlink [IEEE Computer Society,
1993] are two such examples.
