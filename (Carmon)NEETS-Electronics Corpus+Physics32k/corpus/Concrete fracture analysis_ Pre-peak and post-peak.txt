If we plot stress (Pascal) vs. strain (percentage deformation) characteristics of a material, the maximum stress up to which the material can be loaded is known as peak value (




f

t




{\displaystyle f_{t}}
). The behaviour of concrete and steel can be compared to understand the difference in their fracture characteristics. For this a strain controlled loading of un-notched specimen of each materials can be done. From the observations we can draw these conclusions:
Pre-peak
Steel exhibits linear elastic response up to yield stress and strain approximately 0.1%. After that it undergoes plastic deformation due internal dislocations up to a strain corresponding to 25%.
Concrete exhibits linear response to a stress value: 0.6




f

t




{\displaystyle f_{t}}
(60% of peak stress), then after internal micro‑cracking induces plastic response up to peak stress value (




f

t




{\displaystyle f_{t}}
). This peak value is observed at a strain of approximately 0.01%.
Post-peak
Metals behaviour after peak value of stress is still a dilemma to scientists. After this peak value necking complicates the analysis and it is of no practical usefulness.
In post peak zone concrete exhibits additional strains. We can observe a localized crack and elastic unloading in this region. Also a strain cannot be properly defined at the crack, we may prefer a stress crack opening displacement (σ-COD) model for the purpose of analysis.
