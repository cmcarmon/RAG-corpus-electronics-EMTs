Many familiar physical systems that exhibit oscillatory behavior, such as clock
pendulums, automobile suspensions, tuned filters in radios, and inter-chip dig-
ital interconnections are predominantly second-order systems. That is, their
dynamics are well described by second-order differential equations. Second-
order systems contain two energy storage elements with independent states.
For example, a second-order circuit could contain two independent capacitors,
two independent inductors, or one capacitor and one inductor. In contrast, the
circuits studied in Chapter 10 contained only one energy storage element that
is, one capacitor or one inductor. Therefore, their dynamics were described by
first-order differential equations. As we shall see in this chapter, the dynamics
of first-order circuits and second-order circuits can be very different.
