Appendix: Books on MEMS
A great deal of information on the design, simulation, fabrica-
tion, packaging, testing, and applications for MEMS is avail-
able.
Information can be found in journals, conference
proceedings, and on the World Wide Web. In the past several
years many books on MEMS have been published. They are
listed in this Appendix. It is possible to group them by subject.
This is complicated by the fact that some books cover several
main subdivisions of MEMS. Hence, we content ourselves to
list them chronologically by the year of their appearance.
