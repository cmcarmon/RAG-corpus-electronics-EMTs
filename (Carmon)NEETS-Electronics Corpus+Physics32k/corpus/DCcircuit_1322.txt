This is called the normal magnetization curve, or B-H curve, for any particular material.
Notice how the ﬂux density for any of the above materials (cast iron, cast steel, and sheet
steel) levels off with increasing amounts of ﬁeld intensity. This effect is known as saturation.
When there is little applied magnetic force (low H), only a few atoms are in alignment, and
the rest are easily aligned with additional force. However, as more ﬂux gets crammed into
the same cross-sectional area of a ferromagnetic material, fewer atoms are available within
that material to align their electrons with additional force, and so it takes more and more
force (H) to get less and less ”help” from the material in creating more ﬂux density (B). To
put this in economic terms, we’re seeing a case of diminishing returns (B) on our investment
(H). Saturation is a phenomenon limited to iron-core electromagnets. Air-core electromagnets
don’t saturate, but on the other hand they don’t produce nearly as much magnetic ﬂux as a
ferromagnetic core for the same number of wire turns and current.
