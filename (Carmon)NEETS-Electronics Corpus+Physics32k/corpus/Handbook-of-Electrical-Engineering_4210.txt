frequency of the search radar and the higher frequency desired for the tracking radar. The degree of signature
measurement implemented to support such functions as noncooperative target identiÔ¨Åcation depends on the
resolution capability of the radar as well as the operational user requirements. Multiple-function radar design
represents a compromise among these different requirements. However, implementation constraints, multiple-
target handling requirements, and reaction time requirements often dictate the use of phased array radar systems
integrating search, track, and characterization functions.
