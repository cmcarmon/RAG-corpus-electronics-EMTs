In physics, the perpendicular axis theorem (or plane figure theorem) can be used to determine the moment of inertia of a rigid object that lies entirely within a plane, about an axis perpendicular to the plane, given the moments of inertia of the object about two perpendicular axes lying within the plane. The axes must all pass through a single point in the plane.
Define perpendicular axes



x


{\displaystyle x}
,



y


{\displaystyle y}
, and



z


{\displaystyle z}
(which meet at origin



O


{\displaystyle O}
) so that the body lies in the



x
y


{\displaystyle xy}
plane, and the



z


{\displaystyle z}
axis is perpendicular to the plane of the body. Let Ix, Iy and Iz be moments of inertia about axis x, y, z respectively, the perpendicular axis theorem states that





I

z


=

I

x


+

I

y




{\displaystyle I_{z}=I_{x}+I_{y}}

This rule can be applied with the parallel axis theorem and the stretch rule to find moments of inertia for a variety of shapes.
If a planar object (or prism, by the stretch rule) has rotational symmetry such that




I

x




{\displaystyle I_{x}}
and




I

y




{\displaystyle I_{y}}
are equal, then the perpendicular axes theorem provides the useful relationship:





I

{\displaystyle I_{z}=2I_{x}=2I_{y}}
