1.1.6 A beam containing two types of charged particles
is moving from A to B. Particles of type I with
charge +3q, and those of type II with charge
−2q (where −q is the charge of an electron given
by −1.6 × 10
−19 C) ﬂow at rates of 5 × 1015/s
and 10× 1015/s, respectively. Evaluate the current
ﬂowing in the direction from B to A.
1.1.7 A charge q(t ) = 50+ 1.0t C ﬂows into an electric
