Figure 3-12 shows a typical ratio detector. The input tank capacitor (C1) and the primary of
transformer T1 (L1) are tuned to the center frequency of the fm signal to be demodulated. The secondary
winding of T1 (L2) and capacitor C2 also form a tank circuit tuned to the center frequency. Tertiary
(third) winding L3 provides additional inductive coupling which reduces the loading effect of the
secondary on the primary circuit. Diodes CR1 and CR2 rectify the signal from the secondary tank.
Capacitor C5 and resistors R1 and R2 set the operating level of the detector. Capacitors C3 and C4
determine the amplitude and polarity of the output. Resistor R3 limits the peak diode current and
furnishes a dc return path for the rectified signal. The output of the detector is taken from the common
connection between C3 and C4. Resistor RL is the load resistor. R5, C6, and C7 form a low-pass filter to
the output.
