Now, we have continuity from the Source, to the newly-made connection, down, to the right,
and up to the Destination. This is analogous to putting a ”tee” ﬁtting in one of the capped-off
pipes and directing water through a new segment of pipe to its destination. Please take note
that the broken segment of wire on the right hand side has no electrons ﬂowing through it,
because it is no longer part of a complete path from Source to Destination.
