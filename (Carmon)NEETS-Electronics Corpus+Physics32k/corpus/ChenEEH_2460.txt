The above substitutions also lead to a simple relationship
between the complex input impedances of the complementary
antennas. If Zsl is the complex input impedance as seen across
the input of an arbitrary slot antenna and Zcd is that of its
complementary dipole antenna, then using the substitutions
prescribed in Babinetâ€™s principle, one can show:
