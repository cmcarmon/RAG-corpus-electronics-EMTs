If you touch the unconnected lead of the 100 kΩ resistor (without closing the 
circuit), you may see the LED light up briefly and go out (especially if you 
shuffle your feet on a carpet first). That’s because you’ve built up a minute 
amount of charge on your finger, and when you touch the resistor, the charge 
flows into the base of the first transistor and is amplified enough by the 
Darlington pair to light the LED. (If the nominal gain, hFE, of your transistors is 
100, the total gain of the Darlington pair is 100 100 10 000
.) After the charge 
has dissipated, the LED goes out. (Note that if you use an antistatic wrist 
strap when you touch the resistor, the LED will not light.)
