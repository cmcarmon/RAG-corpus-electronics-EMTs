(14.3.9)
where Na = GkTaB is the output noise power caused only by the ampliﬁer, G is the power gain
of the ampliﬁer, and B is the bandwidth of the ampliﬁer. Note that the ampliﬁer noise Na is added
to the ampliﬁed source noise to yield the output power in Equation (14.3.9). If T = T0 (i.e., room
∼= Na, and the ampliﬁer noise dominates the source noise, which is a
temperature), then Nout
common occurrence. When Ta >> T0, the ampliﬁer is very noisy, although not physically hot.
