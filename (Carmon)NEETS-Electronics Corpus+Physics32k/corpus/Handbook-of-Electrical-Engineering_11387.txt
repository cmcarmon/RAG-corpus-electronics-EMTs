for a wave propagating in the positive x direction, where p is the pressure (or one of the other parameters listed
above), P is its amplitude, w is the angular frequency, and w = 2pf where f is the frequency in hertz, k is the
propagation constant and k = w/c where c is the propagation speed, a is the attenuation coefﬁcient, and t is
the time. The wave can experience signiﬁcant attenuation, as represented by the exponential decay of amplitude
with  distance,  during  propagation  in  tissues.  The  attenuation  coefﬁcient  varies  greatly  among  tissues  [Goss
et al., 1978, 1980; Haney and O’Brien, 1986] but is low for most body ﬂuids, much higher for solid tissues, and
very high for bone and lung (see Table 116.1). The skin depth is the distance that the wave can propagate before
being attenuated to e–1 of its original amplitude and is thus simply the inverse of the attenuation coefﬁcient.
