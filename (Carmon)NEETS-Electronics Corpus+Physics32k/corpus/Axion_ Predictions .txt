One theory of axions relevant to cosmology had predicted that they would have no electric charge, a very small mass in the range from 10âˆ’6 to 1 eV/c2, and very low interaction cross-sections for strong and weak forces. Because of their properties, axions would interact only minimally with ordinary matter. Axions would also change to and from photons in magnetic fields.
