The maximum value of gm is obtained when VGS = 0 (IDS = IDSS) and is given by gm(VGS = 0) = gm0 = 2ID S /(–VP).
Small-Signal AC Voltage Gain
Let’s consider the CS ampliﬁer circuit of Fig. 24.13. The input ac signal is
applied between gate and source, and the output ac voltage is taken between
drain and source. Thus the source electrode of this triode device is common
to input and output, hence the designation of this JFET conﬁguration as a
CS ampliﬁer.
