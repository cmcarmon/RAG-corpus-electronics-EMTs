In a pump, cavitation will first occur at the inlet of the impeller. Denoting the inlet by i, the NPSHA at this point is defined as:






NPSH

{\displaystyle {\text{NPSH}}_{A}=\left({\frac {p_{i}}{\rho g}}+{\frac {V_{i}^{2}}{2g}}\right)-{\frac {p_{v}}{\rho g}}}

where




p

i




{\displaystyle p_{i}}
is the absolute pressure at the inlet,




V

i




{\displaystyle V_{i}}
is the average velocity at the inlet,



ρ


{\displaystyle \rho }
is the fluid density,



g


{\displaystyle g}
is the acceleration of gravity and




p

v




{\displaystyle p_{v}}
is the vapor pressure of the fluid. Note that it is equivalent to the sum of both the static and dynamic heads – that is, the stagnation head – from which one deducts the head corresponding to the equilibrium vapor pressure, hence "net positive suction head".
Applying the first law of thermodynamics for control volumes enclosing the suction free surface 0 and the pump inlet i, under the assumption that the kinetic energy at 0 is negligible, that the fluid is inviscid, and that the fluid density is constant:

{\displaystyle {\frac {p_{0}}{\rho g}}+z_{0}={\frac {p_{i}}{\rho g}}+{\frac {V_{i}^{2}}{2g}}+z_{i}+h_{f}}

Using the above application of Bernoulli to eliminate the velocity term and local pressure terms in the definition of NPSHA:

This is the standard expression for the available NPSH at point. Cavitation will occur at the point i when the available NPSH is less than the NPSH required to prevent cavitation (NPSHR). For simple impeller systems, NPSHR can be derived theoretically, but very often it is determined empirically. Note NPSHAand NPSHR are in absolute units and usually expressed in "m abs" not "psia".
Experimentally, NPSHR is often defined as the NPSH3, the point at which the head output of the pump decreases by 3 % at a given flow due to reduced hydraulic performance. On multi-stage pumps this is limited to a 3 % drop in the first stage head.
