OPERATION BELOW RESONANCE.â€”When the input frequency is lower than the center
frequency, the current and voltage phase relationships change. When the tuned circuit is operated at a
frequency lower than resonance, the capacitive reactance increases and the inductive reactance decreases.
Below resonance the tank acts like a capacitor and the secondary current leads primary tank voltage ep.
This change to a leading secondary current rotates the vectors in a counterclockwise direction. From the
vector diagram you should see that e2 is brought nearer in phase with ep, while el is shifted further out of
phase with ep. The vector sum of ep and e2 is larger than that of e and e1. Diode CR2 conducts more than
diode CR1 below the center frequency. The voltage drop across R4 is larger than that across R3 and the
output across both is negative.
