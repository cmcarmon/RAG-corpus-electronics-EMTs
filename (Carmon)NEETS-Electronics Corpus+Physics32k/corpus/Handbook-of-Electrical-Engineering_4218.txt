The  signal  processor  is  often  optimized  to  perform  the  repetitive  complex  multiply-and-add  operations
pulse compression
associated with the fast Fourier transform (FFT). FFT processing is used for implementing 
via  fast  convolution  and  for  Doppler  ﬁltering.  Fast  convolution  consists  of  taking  the  FFT  of  the  digitized
receiver output, multiplying it by the stored FFT of the desired ﬁlter function, and then taking the inverse FFT
