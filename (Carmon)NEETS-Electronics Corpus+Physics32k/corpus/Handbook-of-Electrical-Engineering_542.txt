Limiters  
are  named  for  their  ability  to  limit  voltage  excursions  at  the  output  of  a  circuit  whose  input  may
undergo unrestricted variations. They are also called  clipping circuits  because waveforms having rounded peaks
that exceed the limit(s) imposed by such circuits appear, after limiting, to have their peaks ﬂattened, or “clipped”
off. Limiters may be designed to clip positive voltages at a certain level, negative voltages at a different level, or
to do both. The simplest types consist simply of diodes and dc voltage sources, while more elaborate designs
incorporate operational ampliﬁers.
