Space
Only the trivial isometry group C1 leaves the whole space fixed.
Plane
Cs with respect to a plane leaves that plane fixed.
Line
Isometry groups leaving a line fixed are isometries which in every plane perpendicular to that line have common 2D point groups in two dimensions with respect to the point of intersection of the line and the planes.
Cn ( n > 1 ) and Cnv ( n > 1 )
cylindrical symmetry without reflection symmetry in a plane perpendicular to the axis
cases in which the symmetry group is an infinite subset of that of cylindrical symmetry

Point
All other point groups in three dimensions
No fixed points
The isometry group contains translations or a screw operation.
