This is actually a case of current-derived negative feedback, and it successfully holds the collector current
near the quiescent value IQ. Furthermore, it does so in spite of different transistors with different values of hFE
being used and in spite of temperature variations. Actually, VBE itself falls with temperature at about â€“2.2 mV/(cid:176)C
for constant IC , and the circuit will compensate for this, too. The degree of success of the negative feedback in
holding IQ constant is called the bias stability.
