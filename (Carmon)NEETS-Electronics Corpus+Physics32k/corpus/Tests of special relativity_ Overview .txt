Eventually, Albert Einstein (1905) drew the conclusion that established theories and facts known at that time only form a logical coherent system when the concepts of space and time are subjected to a fundamental revision. For instance:
Maxwell-Lorentz's electrodynamics (independence of the speed of light from the speed of the source),
the negative aether drift experiments (no preferred reference frame),
Moving magnet and conductor problem (only relative motion is relevant),
the Fizeau experiment and the aberration of light (both implying modified velocity addition and no complete aether drag).
The result is special relativity theory, which is based on the constancy of the speed of light in all inertial frames of reference and the principle of relativity. Here, the Lorentz transformation is no longer a mere collection of auxiliary hypotheses but reflects a fundamental Lorentz symmetry and forms the basis of successful theories such as Quantum electrodynamics. Special relativity offers a large number of testable predictions, such as:
