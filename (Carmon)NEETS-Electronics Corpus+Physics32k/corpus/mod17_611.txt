Figure 5-18 shows the ends of the crystal or glass tube laser with light waves reflecting back and 
forth between two mirrored surfaces. One mirror is only partially reflective, and light energy is 
transmitted through it to form the light beam. You will find that power sources for lasers include flash 
tubes or, in the case of diode-type lasers, dc power supplies.
