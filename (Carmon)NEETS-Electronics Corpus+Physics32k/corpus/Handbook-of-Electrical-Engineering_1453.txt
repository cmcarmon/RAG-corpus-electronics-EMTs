in terms of these basic units, and a language model which speciÔ¨Åes allowable sequences of vocabulary items.
The acoustic models, and in some cases the language model and lexicon, are learned from a set of representative
training data. These components are discussed in greater detail in the remainder of this chapter, as are the two
recognition paradigms most frequently employed in speech recognition: dynamic time warping and hidden
Markov models.
