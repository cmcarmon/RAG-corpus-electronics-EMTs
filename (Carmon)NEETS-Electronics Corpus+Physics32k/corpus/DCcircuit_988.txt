â€¢ (3) Write KVL equations for each loop of the circuit, substituting the product IR for E
in each resistor term of the equation. Where two mesh currents intersect through a
component, express the current as the algebraic sum of those two mesh currents (i.e. I1
+ I2) if the currents go in the same direction through that component. If not, express the
current as the difference (i.e. I1 - I2).
