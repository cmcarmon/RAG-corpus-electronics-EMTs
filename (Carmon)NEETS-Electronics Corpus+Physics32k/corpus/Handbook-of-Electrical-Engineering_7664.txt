DRAMs  and  SRAMs  differ  little  in  their  applications.  DRAMs  are  distinguished  from  SRAMs  in  that  no
bistable electronic circuit internal to the storage cell maintains the information. Instead DRAM information is
stored “dynamically” as charge on a capacitor. All modern designs feature one ﬁeld-effect transistor (FET) to
access the information for both reading and writing and a thin ﬁlm capacitor for information storage. SRAMs
maintain their bistability, so long as power is applied, by a cross-coupled pair of inverters within each storage
cell. Almost always two additional transistors serve to access the internal nodes for reading and writing. Most
modern cell designs are CMOS, with two P-channel and four N-channel FETs.
