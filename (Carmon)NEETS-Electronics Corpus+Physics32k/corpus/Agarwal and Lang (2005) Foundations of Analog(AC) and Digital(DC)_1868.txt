Figure 13.5 shows a sketch of the input cosine and the output response
with the various magnitudes and phases marked. Notice that the complex
amplitude Vc carries both the amplitude and phase information of the
response (|Vc| and âˆ Vc respectively) in an easily accessible manner. Thus,
our analysis can stop at Equation 13.16.
