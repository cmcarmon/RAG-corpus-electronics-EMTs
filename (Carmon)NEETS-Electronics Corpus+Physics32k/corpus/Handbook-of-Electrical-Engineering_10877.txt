the packing and unpacking routines that usually accompany the toolbox code. For example, the packed state-
space  model  might  have  a  function 
  to  unpack  it  into  separate
components as shown in Fig. 112.9. The advantage is that once packed, the state-space model 
 can be used
in processing as if it was the single system object it represents. To see this, compare the code for simulation
and  analysis  of  a  system  given  in  Fig.  112.10(a)  with  the  MATLAB  Control  System  Toolbox  code  given  in
Fig. 112.10(b).
