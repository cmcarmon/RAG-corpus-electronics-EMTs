Professor Hunt began writing a textbook in Physical Acoustics in 1948. That book was never published; instead, two of its chapters became books that, because of their focused content, continue to be used in courses today.
The first was Electroacoustics, published in 1954. Among other innovations, Hunt proposed novel scalar forms of Lorenz' law and Ampere's law that permit efficient circuit analysis of electrodynamic transducers. This was done by proposing that, just as the constant j=sqrt(-1) is used to denote 90-degree temporal phase shift, an operator k=sqrt(-1) can be used to denote 90-degree spatial phase shift.
The second was "Origins in Acoustics," a posthumously-published history of acoustics from the time of Pythagoras to the 20th century.
