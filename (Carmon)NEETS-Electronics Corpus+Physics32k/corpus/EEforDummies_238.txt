ICs, which I discuss in Chapter 11, are nothing more than a bunch of tiny 
 circuits that work together to perform a function so commonly desired that 
it’s worthwhile to mass‐produce the circuit and package it in a protective 
case with leads (the centipede legs) that enable access to the circuit inside.
