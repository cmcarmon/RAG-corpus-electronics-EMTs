The waveforms in Figure 16.14 have been drawn for the case where the
capacitor discharges appreciably during each half-cycle. This case was chosen
for clarity rather than functionality. When the circuit is used as a DC restorer in
a television set, the RC time constant would normally be chosen to be much
longer than the period of the input wave. In such designs, the output wave
has the same shape as the input wave, except that the waveform is shifted so
as to be always positive. The most negative value of the input voltage is now
clamped to 0 V.
