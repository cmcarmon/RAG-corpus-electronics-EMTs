For SMP systems, the operating system is required to schedule
multiple tasks for execution on multiple processors and to
allocate resources to support such execution. The scheduling
and resources allocation should take into account the need for
load balancing. Since scheduling can be performed by any pro-
cessor, there should be a mechanism to avoid or resolve conﬂicts.
The same or different parts of the operating system can be
executed by many processors, so control information (e.g.,
operating system tables), storage management (e.g., paging
facilities), and synchronization between processors need to be
carefully managed to avoid deadlock or invalid operations.
Furthermore, the operating system should contribute to failure
management—for instance, processor failure should lead to
graceful degradation in services and performance.
