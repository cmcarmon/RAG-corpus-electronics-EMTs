Thermophotovoltaic (TPV) is the title given to a process of generating electric power by photovoltaic conversion
of the energy radiated from a thermal source. The source of energy can be a hydrocarbon or hydrogen burner,
concentrated solar energy, radioisotope or nuclear reactor heating the emitter to an operating temperature in
the range of 1000°C to 1800°C. Two signiﬁcant attributes of TPV systems, relative to photovoltaic solar energy
conversion, are that the source is in close proximity to the cell and thus delivers a high power density and that
the emission spectrum lies in the infrared. TPV cells share many design features with concentrator solar cells,
but are generally made from semiconductors with smaller bandgaps in order to achieve peak response better
matched  to  the  spectrum  of  the  emitter.  Silicon  devices,  however,  are  still  viable  for  systems  with  emitter
temperatures in the upper end of the above range. The ﬁnal component essential for high conversion efﬁciency
is some mechanism for controlling the ﬂux of sub-bandgap photons such that their energy is not lost. This can
be achieved with either selective emission or optical systems to return unused energy to the emitter. Theoret-
ically, TPV systems could achieve conversion efﬁciencies approaching 30%, far higher than any other candidates
for energy conversion in this temperature range. In the near term, a system efﬁciency of 10% is a practical goal.
System design must balance the conversion efﬁciency and power density from the PV converter. This important
trade-off will be described later.
