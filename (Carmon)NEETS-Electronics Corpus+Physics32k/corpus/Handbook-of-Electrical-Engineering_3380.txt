Applications
Many  useful  systems  have  been  demonstrated  using  LiNbO3-based  integrated  optic  devices.  These  system
applications can be grouped into four broad categories: telecommunications, instrumentation, signal processing,
and sensors. In some cases only a single integrated optic device is used, while in other applications a multi-
function component is required.
