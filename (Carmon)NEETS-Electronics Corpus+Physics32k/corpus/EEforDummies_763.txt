By piggybacking multiple 4017 ICs, you can count up tens, hundreds, thou-
sands, and so forth. Pin 12 is high when the count is 0 to 4 and low when the 
count is 5 to 9, so it looks like a trigger signal that changes from low to high 
at one‐tenth the rate of the count. If you feed the output of pin 12 into the 
trigger input (pin 14) of another decade counter, that second counter will 
count up tens. By feeding the second counter’s pin‐12 output into pin 14 of 
a third counter, you can count up hundreds. With enough 4017 ICs, you may 
even be able to tally the national debt!
