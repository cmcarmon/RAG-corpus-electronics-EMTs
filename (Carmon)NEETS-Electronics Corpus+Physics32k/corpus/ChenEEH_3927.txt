where Ni is a sequence of iid zero-mean Gaussian random
variables with variance s2. In practice, this formulation can
be considered as one of estimating a DC signal embedded in
white Gaussian noise. The issue here is to estimate the
strength, i.e., the magnitude, of the DC signal based on the a
set of observations xi, i ¼ 1, 2, , K. The log-likelihood
function as deﬁned in equation 6.22 is given by:
