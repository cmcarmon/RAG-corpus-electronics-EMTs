In this section, we identify and analyze the requirements that a
distributed multimedia application may enforce on the com-
munication network. Due to the vastness of this ﬁeld, we do
not claim that this list is exhaustive, but we have tried to
include all the important aspects (from our view point) that
have signiﬁcantly impacted the enhancements to the basic
Internet architecture and its associated protocols. In Sections
7.3 and 7.4, we further explore these aspects and give readers a
sense of understanding of the efforts made to help the Internet
deal with the challenges posed by such applications.
