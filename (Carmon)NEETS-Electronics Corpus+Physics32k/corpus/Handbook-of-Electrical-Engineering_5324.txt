Response of distribution systems to high penetrations of DG is not yet fully understood. Also, the nature of
the response will depend on the DG technology involved. However, there are some general areas of potential
impacts common to most of the technologies: (i) voltage ï¬‚icker, imbalance, regulation, etc.; (ii) power quality;
