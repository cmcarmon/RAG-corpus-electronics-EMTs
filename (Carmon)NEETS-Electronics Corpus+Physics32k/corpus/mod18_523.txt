Liquid-cooling systems consist of a sea water or a chilled (fresh) water section that cools the distilled 
water circulating through the electronic equipment. The main components of cooling systems are piping, 
valves, regulators, heat exchangers, strainers, circulating pumps, expansion tanks, gages, and 
demineralizers. Other specialized components are sometimes necessary to monitor cooling water to the 
electronic equipment.
