Power meter measurements are conducted on individual optical fiber cables installed on board ship.
The installed optical fiber cable must have connectors or terminations on both ends to make the
measurement. If the installed optical fiber cable does not have connectors or terminations on both ends, an
OTDR should be used to evaluate the cable. If the cable is too short for evaluation with an OTDR, cable
continuity can be verified using a flashlight.
