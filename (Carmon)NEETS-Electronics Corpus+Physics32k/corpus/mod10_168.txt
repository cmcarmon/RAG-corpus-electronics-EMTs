Frequency affects both sound and light. A certain range of sound frequencies produces sensations
that you can hear. A slow vibration (low frequency) in sound gives the sensation of a low note. A more
rapid sound vibration (higher frequency) produces a higher note. Likewise, a certain range of light
frequencies produces sensations that you can see. Violet light is produced at the high-frequency end of the
light spectrum, while red light is produced at the low-frequency end of the light spectrum. A change in
frequency of sound waves causes an audible sensation—a difference in pitch. A change in the frequency
of a light wave causes a visual sensation—a difference in color.
