Instruments
 are the means for monitoring or measuring physical variables. The basic elements of an instru-
measurand, m
(
t
), shown as time-
mentation application are shown in Fig. 108.1. A physical system produces a 
(
s
t
),  that  is  then  processed  by  an
varying,  which  is  transformed  by  a 
t
(
i
).  Producing  meaningful  information  from
instrument  to  yield  the  desired  output  information  variable, 
physical variables requires conversion and processing. Electronic instruments require that physical variables be
  and  signal
converted  to  electrical  signals  through  a  process  of 
processing
