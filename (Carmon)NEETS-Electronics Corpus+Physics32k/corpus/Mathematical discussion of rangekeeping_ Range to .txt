Early in World War II, the range to the target was measured by optical rangefinders. Though some night operations were conducted using searchlights and star shells, in general optical rangefinders were limited to daytime operation. During the latter part of World War II, radar was used to determine the range to the target. Radar proved to be more accurate  than the optical rangefinders (at least under operational conditions) and was the preferred way to determine target range during both night and day.
