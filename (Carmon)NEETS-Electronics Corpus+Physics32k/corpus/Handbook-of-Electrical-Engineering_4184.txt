Measured and Calculated Lightning-Induced Voltages on Overhead Wires
Several experiments have been carried out to test the coupling theory [e.g., Georgiadis et al., 1992; Rubinstein
et al., 1994; Barker et al. 1996]. The basic strategy is the same in each experiment: to measure the lightning
electric and magnetic ﬁelds in the vicinity of an instrumented overhead line while simultaneously measuring
the voltages induced on the line, the measured ﬁelds then being used as inputs to a computer program written
to solve Eqs. (40.17) through (40.19) and the computer-calculated voltage waveforms being compared with the
measured voltage waveforms. The following discussion illustrates the types of voltage waveforms induced on
overhead wires by lightning beyond a few kilometers and the degree of agreement that has been obtained in
the coupling-model calculations. Examples of voltages induced on a 450-m overhead line about 10 m above
the  ground  are  shown  in  Fig. 40.25.  Each  line  end  was  either  terminated  in  its  characteristic  impedance  or
