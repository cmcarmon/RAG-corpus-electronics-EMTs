will  be  equal  to  BVout  (less  the  small  forward 
voltage  drop  of  the  switching  diode,  D).  The 
average current through the inductor, IL , is equal to 
the  load  current,  Iout. Note  that  a  small  amount  of 
ripple voltage appears superimposed on the steady 
output  voltage,  Vout. This  ripple  voltage  can  be 
reduced  by  using  a  relatively  large  value  for  the 
capacitor, C. 
 
In  order  to  control  the  voltage  delivered  to  the 
load, Vout, it is simply necessary to adjust the ratio 
of  on  to  off  time  of  the  switch.  A  larger  ratio  of 
‘on’ to ‘off’ time (i.e. a larger duty  cycle or mark 
to  space  ratio) produces a greater output voltage, 
and vice versa. 
 
In  a  practical  switched  mode  power  supply,  the 
witch, S1, is replaced by a semiconductor switching 
device  (i.e.  a  bipolar  switching  transistor  or  a 
MOSFET device). The switching device must have 
a low ‘on’ resistance and a high ‘off’ resistance and 
must be capable of switching from the ‘on’ state to 
the ‘off’ state in a very short time. 
  Regardless of whether it is a bipolar transistor or 
a MOSFET, the switching device is controlled by a 
train  of  rectangular  pulses  applied  to  its  base  or 
gate terminal. The output voltage can be controlled 
by varying the width of the pulses in this train. In a 
practical  switched  mode  power  supply,  a  closed-
loop feedback path is employed in which the output 
voltage is sensed and fed back to the control input 
of  a  pulse  generator.  The  result  is  pulse  width 
modulation  (PWM) of  the  pulse  train  to  the 
switching device. This pulse width modulation can 
be achieved using a handful of discrete components 
or, more usually, is based on a dedicated switched 
mode controller chip. 
  The  job  of  controlling  a  switched  mode  power 
supply is an ideal task for an integrated circuit and
