form as the characteristic polynomial in the homogeneous solution,
(see Chapter 10, Equation 10.9 for example) so the value of s in the
homogeneous solution could have been found from this denominator
without any formal solution of the homogeneous equation. That this is
a general result can be shown by examining the two derivations.
