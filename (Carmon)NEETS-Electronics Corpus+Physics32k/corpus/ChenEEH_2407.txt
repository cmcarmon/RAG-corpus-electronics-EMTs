The ^rri is the polarization unit vector of the incident wave. Like
the radiating polarization unit vector ^rr, the incident polariza-
tion unit vector ^rri may be transformed to a new coordinate
i, ^ff0
system (^uu0
i) aligned with the major and minor axes of the
incident polarization ellipse, respectively. The angle between
the ^uu and ^uu0
