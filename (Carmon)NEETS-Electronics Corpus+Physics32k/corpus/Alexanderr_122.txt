since it is assumed to have zero potential. A reference node is indicated
by any of the three symbols in Fig. 3.1. The type of ground in Fig. 3.1(c)
is called a chassis ground and is used in devices where the case, enclo-
sure,  or  chassis  acts  as  a  reference  point  for  all  circuits.  When  the
potential of the earth is used as reference, we use the earth ground in
Fig. 3.1(a) or (b). We shall always use the symbol in Fig. 3.1(b).
