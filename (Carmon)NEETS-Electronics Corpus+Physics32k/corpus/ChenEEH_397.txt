A further small problem exists because the output voltage
in the RLC circuit of Figure 4.7(A) is taken at the capacitor
node. In the active circuit, this node (V1 in Figure 4.7(C)), is
not an op-amp output and may not be loaded without dis-
turbing the ﬁlter parameters. A solution is readily obtained.
The voltage Vout in Figure 4.7(C) is evidently proportional to
V1 because V2 ¼ V1: Vout=V1 ¼ 1 þ R4=RL ¼ 2. Therefore,
