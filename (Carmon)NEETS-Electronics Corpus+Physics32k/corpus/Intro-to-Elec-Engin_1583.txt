Systems is a term used in many Ô¨Åelds of study: economics, ecology, social and physical
sciences. The catchword is used to describe an assemblage of components, subsystems, and
interfaces arranged or existing in such a fashion as to perform a function or functions in order to
achieve a goal. Control refers to the function or purpose of the system we wish to discuss. Control
is almost always realized not by a single component, such as a transistor, resistor, or motor, but
by an entire system of components and interfaces.
