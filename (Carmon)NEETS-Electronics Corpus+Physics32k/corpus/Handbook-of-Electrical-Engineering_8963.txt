Light Beam Interruption. This is a fairly straightforward technology that requires a matrix of light sources
and detectors facing each other in the X and Y directions. When the beams from the X and Y light sources are
interrupted, this is sensed by the facing light detectors and the signals are sent to the controller. The light beams
