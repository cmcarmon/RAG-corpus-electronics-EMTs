The signal processing enhancement of pulse-Doppler allows small high-speed objects to be detected in close proximity to large slow moving reflectors. To achieve this, the transmitter must be coherent and should produce low phase noise during the detection interval, and the receiver must have large instantaneous dynamic range.
Pulse-Doppler signal processing detailed explanation
Pulse-Doppler signal processing also includes ambiguity resolution to identify true range and velocity.
Ambiguity resolution detailed explanation
The received signals from multiple PRF are compared to determine true range using the range ambiguity resolution process.
Range ambiguity resolution detailed explanation
The received signals are also compared using the frequency ambiguity resolution process.
