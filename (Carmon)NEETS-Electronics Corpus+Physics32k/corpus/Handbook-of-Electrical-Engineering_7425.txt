Most passive telemeters are essentially an inductance and a capacitance coupled as a resonant circuit. Either
of these components may be pressure sensitive or temperature sensitive. A nearby magnetic coil coupled to this
circuit can, by means of a varying frequency, determine the resonant point of the telemeter, which can then be
a function of the temperature or pressure being measured.
