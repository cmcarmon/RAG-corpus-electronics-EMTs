A person who has stopped breathing is not necessarily dead, but is in immediate danger. Life is
dependent upon oxygen, which is breathed into the lungs and then carried by the blood to every body cell.
Since body cells cannot store oxygen, and since the blood can hold only a limited amount (and that only
for a short time), death will surely result from continued lack of breathing.
