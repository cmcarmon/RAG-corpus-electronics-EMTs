FIGURE 113.8 Model response to continuous sinusoidal stimulation at 500 Hz. The lower panel depicts the response to
a stimulus current set at threshold level (IT) for a single-cycle stimulus. Upper panels show responses for stimulation 20 and
50%  above  the  single-cycle  threshold.  (Source:  J.  P.  Reilly, V.  T.  Freeman,  and  W.  D.  Larkin, “Sensory  effects  of  transient
