While the L1-C2 network greatly reduces ac ripple it has little effect on dc. You should recall that an 
inductor offers no reactance to dc. The only opposition to current flow is the resistance of the wire in the 
choke. Generally, this resistance is very low and the dc voltage drop across the coil is minimal. Thus, the 
LC filter overcomes the disadvantages of the RC filter.
