Boyle macromodel: A SPICE computer model for an op amp. Developed by G.R. Boyle in 1974.
Equivalent noise current (ENI): A noise current source that is effectively in parallel with either the nonin-
verting  input  terminal  (ENI+)  or  the  inverting  input  terminal  (ENIâ€“)  and  represents  the  total  noise
contributed by the op amp if either input terminal is open circuited.
