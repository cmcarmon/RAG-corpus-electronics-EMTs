(3.4.2)
and the phase shift becomes −45° at that cutoff frequency, as shown in Figure 3.4.2. The power
delivered to the circuit, at this frequency, is one-half the maximum power. As a consequence, ωCO
is also called the half-power point, or half-power angular frequency. We see that this ﬁlter circuit
of Figure 3.4.1 is indeed a low-pass ﬁlter because any input signal components at ω << ωCO are
passed to the output with virtually unchanged amplitude and phase, whereas any components
at ω >> ωCO have greatly reduced output amplitudes. ωCO roughly divides the passband
(region of transmitted frequencies) from the stopband (region of high attenuation). The range
of transmitted frequencies is known as the bandwidth. Note that in Figure 3.4.1 the low-pass
ﬁltering properties come from the fact that the capacitor is an open circuit for ω = 0 but becomes
a short circuit for ω → ∞ and “shorts out” any high-frequency voltage components across the
output.
