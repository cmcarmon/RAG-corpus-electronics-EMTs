Thin Oxides
According to Eq. (24.53), thinner oxides allow shorter devices and therefore higher packing densities for devices.
In  addition,  driving  ability  is  increased,  shortening  response  times  for  capacitive  loads,  and  output  resistance
and transconductance are increased. There are some basic limitations upon how thin the oxide can be made.
For instance, there is a maximum oxide ﬁeld that the insulator can withstand. It is thought that the intrinsic
breakdown voltage of SiO2 is of the order of 107 V/cm, a ﬁeld that can support » 221013 charges/cm2, a large
enough  value  to  make  this  ﬁeld  limitation  secondary.  Unfortunately,  as  they  are  presently  manufactured,  the
intrinsic breakdown of MOSFET oxides is much less likely to limit ﬁelds than defect-related leakage or breakdown,
and control of these defects has limited reduction of oxide thicknesses in manufacture to about 5 nm to date.
If defect-related problems could be avoided, the thinnest useful oxide would probably be about 3 nm, limited
by direct tunneling of channel carriers to the gate. This tunneling limit is not well established, and also is subject
to  oxide-defect  enhancement  due  to  tunneling  through  intermediate  defect  levels.  Thus,  the  manufacture  of
thin oxides is a very active area of exploration.
