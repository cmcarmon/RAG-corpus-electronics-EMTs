Comparison of Bipolar Transistor and MESFET Noise Figures
In  low-noise  applications,  GaAs  MESFETs  are  generally  preferred  to  Si  bipolar  transistors.  The  MESFET
demonstrates a lower noise ﬁgure than the bipolar transistor throughout the microwave frequency range, and
the  advantage  increases  with  frequency.  This  advantage  is  demonstrated  by  a  comparison  of  the  expressions
for the minimum noise ﬁgure for the two devices. The bipolar transistor has a minimum noise ﬁgure that can
be expressed as
