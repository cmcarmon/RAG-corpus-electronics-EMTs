However, if the diode is reversed as shown in view B of figure 1-21, a negative output voltage would
be obtained. This is because the current would be flowing from the top of RL toward the bottom, making
the output at the top of RL  negative with respect to the bottom or ground. Because current flows in this
circuit only during half of the input cycle, it is called a half-wave rectifier.
