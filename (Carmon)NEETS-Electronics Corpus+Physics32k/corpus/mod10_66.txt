The two types of wave motion, transverse and longitudinal, have many of the same characteristics,
such as frequency, amplitude, and wavelength. Another important characteristic that these two types of
wave motion share is VELOCITY. Velocity of propagation is the rate at which the disturbance travels
through the medium, or the velocity with which the crest of the wave moves along. The velocity of the
wave depends both on the type of wave (light, sound, or radio) and type of medium (air, water, or metal).
If longitudinal waves are plotted as a graph, they appear as transverse waves. This fact is illustrated in
figure 1-8.
