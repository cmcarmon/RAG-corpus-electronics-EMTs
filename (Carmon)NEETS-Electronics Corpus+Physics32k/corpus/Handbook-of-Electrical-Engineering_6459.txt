In the case of our intercept problem, even though we have lowered the power spectral density of the transmitted
signal so that it falls below the noise ﬂoor, we have not lowered its power (i.e., we have merely spread its power
over a wider frequency range). Thus, if the radiometer integrates over a sufﬁciently long period of time, it will
eventually determine the presence of the transmitted signal buried in the noise. The key point, of course, is
that the use of the spreading makes the interceptor’s task much more difﬁcult, since he has no knowledge of
the spreading code and, thus, cannot despread the signal.
