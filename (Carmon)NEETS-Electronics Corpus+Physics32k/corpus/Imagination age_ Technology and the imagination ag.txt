Key to the idea that imagination is becoming the key commodity of our time is a confidence that Virtual Reality technology, like Oculus Rift and HoloLens will emerge to take much of the place of the current text and graphic dominated Internet. This will provide a 3-D Internet where imagination and creativity over information and search will be key talents to creating user experience and value.
The concept is not limited to just virtual reality. Charlie Magee states that the technology that will develop during the imagination age would include:
The best bet is on a hybrid breakthrough created by the meshing of nanotechnology, computer science (including artificial intelligence), biotechnology (including biochemistry, biopsychology, etc.), and virtual reality.
In The Singularity is Near Raymond Kurzweil states that future combination of AI, nano-technology, and biotechnology will create a world where anything that can be imagined will be possible, raising the importance of imagination as the key mode of human thinking.
