Unlike stationary normal shockwaves, moving normal shockwaves are more commonly available in physical situations. For example, a blunt object entering into the atmosphere faces a shock that comes through the medium of a non-moving gas. The fundamental problem that comes through moving normal shockwaves is the moment of a normal shockwave through motionless gas. The viewpoint of the moving shockwaves characterizes it as a moving or non-moving shock wave. The example of an object entering into the atmosphere depicts an object traveling in the opposite direction of the shockwave resulting in a moving shockwave, but if the object was launching into space, riding on top of the shockwave, it would appear to be a stationary shockwave. The relations and comparisons along with speed and shock ratios of moving and stationary shockwaves can be calculated through extensive formulas.
