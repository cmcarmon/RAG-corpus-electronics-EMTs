Starting in 1984, the IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications (JSAC) initiated the publication of
a sequence of issues devoted speciﬁcally to the subject of computer-aided design and analysis of communication
systems. A brief study of the contents of these issues tells much about the rapid development of the discipline.
The ﬁrst issue, published in January 1984 [Balaban et al., 1984], emphasizes communication links, although
there are a number of papers devoted to networks. The portion devoted to links contained a large collection
of papers devoted to simulation packages.
