As  well  as  their  application  as  a  general-purpose 
amplifying  device,  operational  amplifiers  have  a 
number of other uses, including voltage followers, 
differentiators, 
and 
summing amplifiers. We shall conclude this section 
by taking a brief look at each of these applications. 
 
Voltage followers 
 
A voltage follower using an operational amplifier is 
shown  in  Fig.  8.11.  This  circuit  is  essentially  an 
inverting amplifier in which 100% of the output is 
fed back to the input. The result is an amplifier that 
has a voltage gain of 1 (i.e. unity), a very high input 
resistance  and  a  very  high  output  resistance.  This 
stage is often referred to as a buffer and is used for 
matching  a  high-impedance  circuit  to  a  low-
impedance circuit.  
  Typical  input  and  output  waveforms  for  a 
voltage  follower  are  shown  in  Fig.  8.12.  Notice 
how  the  input  and  output  waveforms  are  both  in-
phase (they rise and fall together) and that they are 
identical in amplitude. 
 
Differentiators 
 
A differentiator  using  an  operational  amplifier  is 
shown  in  Fig.  8.13.  A  differentiator  produces  an 
output  voltage  that  is  equivalent  to  the  rate  of 
change of its input. This may sound a little complex 
but  it  simply  means  that,  if  the  input  voltage
