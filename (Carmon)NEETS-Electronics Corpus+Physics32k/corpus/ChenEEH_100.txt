Circuit Matrix
Consider a circuit C in a connected directed graph G with n
vertices and m edges. This circuit can be traversed in one of two
directions, clockwise or counterclockwise. The direction chosen
for traversing C is called the orientation of C. If an edge
e ¼ (vi, vj) directed from vi to vj is in C, and if vi appears
before vj in traversing C in the direction speciﬁed by the orien-
tation of C, then the orientation agrees with the orientation of e.
The circuit matrix Bc ¼ [bij] of G has m columns, one for
each edge, and has one row for each circuit in G. The element
bij is deﬁned as follows:
