a direct wave and a ground-reﬂected wave. These two waves act in canceling their average signal strengths
and result in excessive pathloss at the receiver.
Multipath fading:
 Due to the human-made environment in which mobile units travel, the instantaneous
signal sent from the base station is reﬂected back and forth from buildings and other ground objects
before  arriving  at  the  mobile  unit  and  causes  signal  fading  received  in  the  time  domain.  This  signal
fading causes an increase in the bit error rate (BER) and in the degradation of voice quality.
Human-made noise:
 The antenna height of mobile units is usually low. Therefore, human-made industrial
noise,  automotive  ignition  noise,  etc.  are  very  easily  received  by  the  mobile  unit.  This  noise  will  raise
the noise ﬂoor and impact system performance.
Dispersive  medium: 
Due  to  the  human-made  environment  and  the  low  antenna  height  of  the  mobile
unit,  the  signal  after  bouncing  back  and  forth  from  the  human-made  structures  produces  multiple
reﬂected waves which arrive at the mobile unit at different times. One impulse sent from the base station
propagating through the medium becomes multiple reﬂected impulses received at different times at the
mobile unit. This medium is called a dispersive medium. First the dispersive medium does not affect
the  analog  voice  channel,  but  does  affect  the  data  channels.  Second,  the  medium  becomes  effective
depending  on  the  transmission  symbol  rate  of  the  system.  The  dispersive  medium  will  impact  the
reception performance when the transmission rate is over 20 kbps. Third, the dispersive medium becomes
more effective in urban areas than in suburban areas.
