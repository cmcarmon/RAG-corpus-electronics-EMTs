On the other hand, static shocks from certain electronic components can 
be harmful. The capacitor, an electronic component that stores energy in 
an electric field, is designed to hold a static charge. Most capacitors in elec-
tronic circuits store a very minute amount of charge for extremely short 
periods of time, but some capacitors, such as those used in bulky power sup-
plies, can store near‐lethal doses for several minutes — or even hours.
