Failure-to-follow distortion: Can occur during demodulation of an amplitude-modulated signal by a peak
detector circuit. If the capacitance of the low-pass RC Ô¨Ålter of the peak detector is large, then the output
fails to follow the envelope of the input signal, resulting in failure-to-follow distortion.
