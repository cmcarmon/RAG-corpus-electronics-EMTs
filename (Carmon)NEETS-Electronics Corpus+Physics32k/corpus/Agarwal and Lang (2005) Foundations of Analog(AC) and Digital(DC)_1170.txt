Computing the output resistance needs more work. As depicted in Figure 8.40, let us
turn off the independent sources, apply a small test voltage vtest at the output terminal
and measure the corresponding current itest. The output resistance will be given by
rout = vtest/itest.
In order to compute rout, we apply KCL at node a shown in Figure 8.40. The dependent
source current ids depends on vgs, and vgs equals âˆ’vtest. Therefore, we have
