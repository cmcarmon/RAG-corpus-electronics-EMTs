The fidelity of a receiver is its ability to accurately reproduce, in its output, the signal that appears at
its input. You will usually find the broader the band passed by frequency selection circuits, the greater
your fidelity. You may measure fidelity by modulating an input frequency with a series of audio
frequencies; you then plot the output measurements at each step against the audio input frequencies. The
resulting curve will show the limits of reproduction.
