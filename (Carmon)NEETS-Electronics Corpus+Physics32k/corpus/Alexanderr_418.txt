1. The behavior of such a network is captured by the idea of damping,
which is the gradual loss of the initial stored energy, as evidenced by
the continuous decrease in the amplitude of the response. The damp-
ing effect is due to the presence of resistance R. The damping factor

is  not  only  undamped  but  also  oscillatory. The  circuit  is  said  to  be
loss-less, because the dissipating or damping element (R) is absent.
By adjusting the value of R, the response may be made undamped,
overdamped, critically damped, or underdamped.
