In the circular restricted three-body problem two heavy masses orbit each other at constant radial distance and angular velocity, and a particle of negligible mass is affected by their gravity. By shifting to a rotating coordinate system where the masses are stationary a centrifugal force is introduced. Energy and momentum are not conserved separately in this coordinate system, but the Jacobi integral remains constant:

. That is, the particle will not be able to cross over this surface (since the squared velocity would have to become negative). This is the zero-velocity surface of the problem.
Note that this means zero velocity in the rotating frame: in a non-rotating frame the particle is seen as rotating with the other bodies. The surface also only predicts what regions cannot be entered, not the shape of the trajectory within the surface.
