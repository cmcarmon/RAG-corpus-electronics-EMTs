Various tools such as the Functional Reach Test (FRT) and Limits Of Stability (LOS) test have been used to assess LoS.
FRT: This is the conventional test used to assess balance and LoS in the forward direction. FRT is inexpensive and easy to use. The drawback of this test is that it assess balance issues in a standing posture where the feet are in a static position and measures LoS only in the forward direction.
LOS: This is a more sophisticated tool than FRT used to measure balance under multi-directional conditions. The subject is asked to stand on force plates and intentionally shift his body weight in the cued direction.
