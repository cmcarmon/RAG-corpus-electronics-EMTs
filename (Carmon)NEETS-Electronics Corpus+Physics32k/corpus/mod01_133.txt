A more modern theory of magnetism is based on the electron spin principle. From the study of
atomic structure it is known that all matter is composed of vast quantities of atoms, each atom containing
one or more orbital electrons. The electrons are considered to orbit in various shells and subshells
depending upon their distance from the nucleus. The structure of the atom has previously been compared
to the solar system, wherein the electrons orbiting the nucleus correspond to the planets orbiting the sun.
Along with its orbital motion about the sun, each planet also revolves on its axis. It is believed that the
electron also revolves on its axis as it orbits the nucleus of an atom.
