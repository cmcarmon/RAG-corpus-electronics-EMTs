matrices of dimension n  n do form an algebra equation
although it is not commutative. How the associated operations
are deﬁned in this algebra along with interesting and import-
ant characteristics, are illustrated in some detail. This discus-
sion provides a ﬁrm foundation for an understanding of
algebra for the engineer. Concluding this chapter are examples
of other types of algebras and applications of interest to the
control engineer.
