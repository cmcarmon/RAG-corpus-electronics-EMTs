Lastly, DCMOS circuits cannot be cascaded; they have to
be interleaved by inverting functions for proper operation,
a solution provided by Domino logic circuits. In addition,
Domino circuits are noninverting in nature and cannot
implement all functions. All these problems have aided in ruling
out the use of DCMOS and favoring the use of SCMOS style.
Another approach to design low-power circuits is to use
complementary-pass-transistor logic (CPL) or transmission
gate theory. CPL features low-power consumption and a
reduced number of transistors. In addition, certain functions
are more efÔ¨Åciently implemented using this family, such as
XOR gates and MUXs. One major drawback of this family is
the weak driving capability with reduced swing outputs, which
limits the number of CPL stages that can be cascaded.
