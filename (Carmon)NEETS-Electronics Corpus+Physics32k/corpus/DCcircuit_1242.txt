Normally, electrons cannot enter a conductor unless there is a path for an equal amount
of electrons to exit (remember the marble-in-tube analogy?). This is why conductors must be
connected together in a circular path (a circuit) for continuous current to occur. Oddly enough,
however, extra electrons can be ”squeezed” into a conductor without a path to exit if an electric
ﬁeld is allowed to develop in space relative to another conductor. The number of extra free
electrons added to the conductor (or free electrons taken away) is directly proportional to the
amount of ﬁeld ﬂux between the two conductors.
