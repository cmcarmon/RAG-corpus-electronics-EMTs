It  is  often  the  case  that  a  particular  point  in  the  communication  network,  either  a  processing  node  or  a
trunk, is the primary source of delay. In this case, this point is usually singled out for analysis, and a simple
model is invoked to analyze the performance at that point. The results of this analysis, combined with results
of other analyses, result in a proﬁle of overall system performance. In this case, the key aspect of the analysis
is to choose an appropriate model for the isolated analysis. In this way, a simpliﬁed analysis leading to useful
results can be performed, and this can lead to an improved network design.
