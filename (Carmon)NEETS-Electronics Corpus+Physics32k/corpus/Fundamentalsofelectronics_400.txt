Figure 4.9: The encoding of signals via the Fourier spectrum is shown over three “periods.” In this ex-
ample, only the third and fourth harmonics are used, as shown by the spectral magnitudes corresponding
to each T -second interval plotted below the waveforms. Can you determine the phase of the harmonics
from the waveform?
