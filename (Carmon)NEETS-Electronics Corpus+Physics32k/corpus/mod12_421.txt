The detection of AM signals ordinarily is accomplished by means of a diode rectifier, which may be
either a vacuum tube or a semiconductor diode. The basic detector circuit is shown in its simplest form in
view (A) of figure 3-5. Views (B), (C), and  (D) show the circuit waveforms. The demodulator must meet
three requirements: (1) It must be sensitive to the type of modulation applied at the input, (2) it must be
nonlinear, and (3) it must provide filtering. Remember that the AM waveform appears like the diagram of
view (B) and the amplitude variations of the peaks represent the original audio signal, but  no modulating
signal frequencies exist in this waveform. The waveform contains only three rf frequencies: (1) the
carrier frequency, (2) the sum frequency, and (3) the difference frequency. The modulating intelligence is
contained in the difference between these frequencies. The vector addition of these frequencies provides
the modulation envelope which approximates the original modulating waveform. It is this modulation
envelope that the DIODE DETECTORS use to reproduce the original modulating frequencies.
