Magnetic Recording Heads
Early recording heads consisted of toroids of magnetically soft ferrites, such as NiZn-ferrite and MnZn-ferrite,
with a few turns of wire around them. For high-density recording applications, however, ferrite can no longer
be used, because the saturation magnetization of ferrite is limited to about 400 kA/m. Saturation of the pole
tips of a ferrite head begins to occur when the deep gap ﬁeld in the head approaches one-half the saturation
magnetization  of  the  ferrite.  Because  the  ﬁelds  seen  by  a  medium  are  one-half  to  one-quarter  the  deep  gap
ﬁeld, media with coercivities above about 80 kA/m cannot be reliably written with a ferrite head. High-density
thin-ﬁlm disk media, metal particle media, and metal evaporated media, therefore, cannot be written with a
ferrite head.
