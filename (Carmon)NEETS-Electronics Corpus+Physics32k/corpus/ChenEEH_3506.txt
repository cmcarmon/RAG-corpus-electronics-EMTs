In some applications, both speech and visual information
may be jointly processed (Chen, 2001; Strobel et al., 2001).
This joint processing is referred to as multimedia or multi-
modal signal processing where data of multiple media like text,
audio,
images, and video are processed in an integrated
manner, and interaction among the different media or modal-
ities is investigated and exploited. Person recognition and
authentication systems that have recently acquired increased
importance in security and surveillance applications can be
made more reliable by combining inputs from different
modalities, such as voice and visual information.
