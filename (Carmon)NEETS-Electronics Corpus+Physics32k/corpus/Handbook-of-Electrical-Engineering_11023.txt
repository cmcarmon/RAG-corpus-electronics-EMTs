The  EMG  is  also  used  to  diagnose  some  degenerative  muscle  and  related  nerve  disorders.  Myotonia  is  a
degenerative disease of muscle ﬁbers in which the muscle relaxes poorly. Insertion of the needle electrode elicits
an intense burst of insertion potentials that sound like a thunderstorm in the loudspeaker. A similar response
is obtained by tapping the muscle. When relaxation does occur, there is electrical silence. Voluntary contraction
produces normal action potentials along with shorter-duration action potentials from the diseased muscle ﬁbers.
Myasthenia  gravis  is  a  disease  in  which  there  is  impairment  of  transmission  of  acetylcholine  across  the
myoneural  junctions  to  the  muscle  ﬁbers.  As  a  result,  muscle  contraction  cannot  be  sustained.  Because  the
muscle ﬁbers are normally innervated, there are no ﬁbrillation potentials. With voluntary contraction, normal
action potentials occur, and if the disease is severe, the action potentials decrease in frequency as the force of
contraction decreases and soon sustained muscle contraction cannot be maintained.
