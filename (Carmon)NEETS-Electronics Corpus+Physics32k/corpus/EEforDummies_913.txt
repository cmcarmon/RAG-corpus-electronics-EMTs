Circuit‐building starter kit
You need an assortment of discrete electronic components (those with two 
or three individual leads), a few ICs, several batteries, and lots of wire to 
connect things. Some components, such as resistors and capacitors, come 
in packages of ten or more pieces. You’ll be happy to know that these compo-
nents are inexpensive (cheap, even); it’ll cost you one or two weeks’ worth of 
lattes to stock up.
