Either check or have someone check all guys, cables, rails, and ladders around your work area for rf 
shock dangers. Use working aloft "chits" and safety harnesses for your own safety. Signing a "working 
aloft chit" signifies that all equipment is in a nonradiating status. The person who signs the chit should 
ensure that no rf danger exists in areas where you or other personnel will be working.
