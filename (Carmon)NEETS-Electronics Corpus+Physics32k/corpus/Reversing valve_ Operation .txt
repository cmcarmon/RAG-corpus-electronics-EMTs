The reversing valve has two states, relaxed and energized. The energized state is typically achieved by applying 24 volts AC, which is commonly used in HVAC. The heat pump can be designed by the manufacturer to produce cooling or heating with the reversing valve in the relaxed state. When the reversing valve is energized, it will produce the opposite conditioning. In other words, a reversing valve installed in such a way as to produce cooling when relaxed will produce heating when energized. Likewise, a reversing valve installed to produce heating when relaxed will produce cooling when energized.
