FDTD and related space-grid time-domain techniques are
direct solution methods for Maxwell’s curl equations. These
methods employ no potentials. Rather, they are based on
volumetric sampling of the unknown electric and magnetic
ﬁelds in and surrounding the structure of interest over a period
of time. The sampling in space is at subwavelength resolution
set by the user to properly sample the highest near-ﬁeld spatial
