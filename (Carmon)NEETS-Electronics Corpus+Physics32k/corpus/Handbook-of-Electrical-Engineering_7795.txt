The number of marks on any given track in this scheme is independent of the track radius; in fact, the number
is the same for all tracks, since the period of revolution of the disk and the clock cycle uniquely determine the
total number of marks on any individual track. Multiplying the number of usable tracks N with the capacity
per track, we obtain for the usable disk capacity
