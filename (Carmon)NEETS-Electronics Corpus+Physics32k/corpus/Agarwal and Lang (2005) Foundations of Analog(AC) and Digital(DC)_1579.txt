a) Assuming that the effect of connecting the oscilloscope to the circuit under test is
to add R2 and C2 as shown in Figure 10.122, find and sketch the step response
that will be observed at vB in this circuit. Discuss the errors introduced by the
scope by comparing your result to what would be observed if the scope were ideal
(R2 → ∞, C2 → 0.) Assume zero initial state.
