As shown in figure 2-39, the typical thyratron modulator is very similar to the spark-gap modulator.
It consists of a power source (Eb), a circuit for storing energy (L2, C2, C3, C4, and C5), a circuit for
discharging the storage circuit (V2), and a pulse transformer (T1). In addition this circuit has a damping
diode (V1) to prevent reverse-polarity signals from being applied to the plate of V2 which could cause V2
to breakdown.
