A transducer may generate an electrical signal by varying one of the following: voltage,
current, resistance, capacitance, self-inductance, mutual-inductance, VP N , VZ, hf e or gm The
most fundamental transducers respond to temperature, electromagnetic radiation intensity,
force, displacement or chemical concentration. If coupled to the time domain these devices
can be used to measure any physical or chemical quantity. Examples of input transducers
