Design Considerations for the Common Emitter Ampliﬁer
Equation (28.12) underscores a serious shortcoming of the canonical common emitter conﬁguration. In par-
ticular, since the internal emitter resistance of a BJT is small, the low frequency voltage gain is sensitive to the
processing  uncertainties  that  accompany  the  numerical  value  of  the  small  signal  beta.  The  problem  can  be
rectiﬁed  at  the  price  of  a  diminished  voltage  gain  magnitude  by  inserting  an emitter  degeneration  resistance,
REE,  in  series  with  the  emitter  lead,  as  shown  in  Fig. 28.15(a).  Since  REE  appears  in  series  with  the  internal
emitter resistance, Re , as suggested in Fig. 28.15(b), the impact of emitter degeneration can be assessed analyt-
ically  by  replacing  Re  in  Eqs. (28.12)  through  (28.28)  by  the  resistance  sum  (Re +  REE).  For  sufﬁciently  large
RE E, such that
