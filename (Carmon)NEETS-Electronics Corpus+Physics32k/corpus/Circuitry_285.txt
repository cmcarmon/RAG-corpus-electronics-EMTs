5.24  Sketch  a  circuit  diagram  showing  a  test 
circuit for obtaining the characteristics of a 
 
 
PNP BJT. Label your diagram clearly and 
indicate the polarity of all supplies and test 
 
 
meters. 
5.25  Sketch  a  circuit  diagram  showing  a  test 
 
circuit for obtaining the characteristics of a 
P-channel  JFET.  Label  your  diagram 
 
clearly  and  indicate  the  polarity  of  all 
 
 
supplies and test meters. 
5.26  Sketch  a  circuit  showing  how  a  thyristor 
 
can be used to control the current through 
a  resistive 
 
load.  Label  your  diagram 
clearly and explain briefly how the circuit 
 
 
is triggered.
