t
+
φ
)


{\displaystyle \psi (x,t)=A\cos(kx-\omega t+\varphi )}

where:
x is position,
t is time,




ψ


{\displaystyle \psi }
(a function of x and t) is the disturbance describing the wave (for example, for an ocean wave,



ψ


{\displaystyle \psi }
would be the excess height of the water, or for a sound wave,



ψ


{\displaystyle \psi }
would be the excess air pressure).
A is the amplitude of the wave (the peak magnitude of the oscillation),




φ


{\displaystyle \varphi }
is a "phase offset" describing how two waves can be out of sync with each other,




ω


{\displaystyle \omega }
is the temporal angular frequency of the wave, describing how many oscillations it completes per unit of time, and related to the period



T


{\displaystyle T}
by the equation



ω
=
2

T


{\displaystyle \omega =2\pi /T}

k


{\displaystyle k}
is the spatial angular frequency (wavenumber) of the wave, describing how many oscillations it completes per unit of space, and related to the wavelength by the equation
