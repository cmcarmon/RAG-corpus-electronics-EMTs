If an external B-field is present and the conductor is not at rest but moving at velocity v, then an extra term must be added to account for the current induced by the Lorentz force on the charge carriers.

{\displaystyle \mathbf {J} =\sigma (\mathbf {E} +\mathbf {v} \times \mathbf {B} )}

In the rest frame of the moving conductor this term drops out because v= 0. There is no contradiction because the electric field in the rest frame differs from the E-field in the lab frame: E′ = E + v×B. Electric and magnetic fields are relative, see Lorentz transformation.
If the current J is alternating because the applied voltage or E-field varies in time, then reactance must be added to resistance to account for self-inductance, see electrical impedance. The reactance may be strong if the frequency is high or the conductor is coiled.
