When Equation (14.2.8) is not satisﬁed, spectral overlap occurs, thereby causing unwanted
spurious components in the ﬁltered output. In particular, if any component of x(t) originally at

order to prevent aliasing, one can process the signal x(t) through a low-pass ﬁlter with bandwidth
Bp ≤ fs /2 prior to sampling.
