it into small particles; each of the particles still retains its original identifying properties of sugar. The
only thing that changed was the physical size of the sugar. If we continue this subdividing process by
grinding the sugar into a fine power, the results are the same. Even dissolving sugar in water does not
change its identifying properties, in spite of the fact that the particles of sugar are now too small to be
seen even with a microscope. Eventually, we end up with a quantity of sugar that cannot be further
divided without its ceasing to be sugar. This quantity is known as a molecule of sugar. If the molecule is
further divided, it is found to consist of three simpler kinds of matter: carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.
These simpler forms are called elements. Therefore, since elements consist of atoms, then a molecule of
sugar is made up of atoms of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.
