▶✓ Work your way around each IC, starting from pin 1, inserting the 
 components that connect to each pin. Then insert any additional 
 components to complete the circuit. Use needle‐nose pliers to bend 
leads and wires to a 90‐degree angle and to insert them into the sockets, 
keeping leads and wires as close to the board as possible to prevent 
them from getting knocked loose.
