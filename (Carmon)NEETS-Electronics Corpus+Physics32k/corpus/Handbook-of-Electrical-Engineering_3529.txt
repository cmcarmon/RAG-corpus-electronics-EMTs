Resource allocation associates behaviors with hardware computational units, and scheduling determines the
order in which behaviors execute. Behaviors that are mutually exclusive can potentially share computational
resources.  Allocation  is  performed  using  a  variety  of  graph  clique  covering  or  node  coloring  algorithms.
Allocation and scheduling are interdependent, and different synthesis strategies perform allocation and sched-
uling different ways. Sometimes scheduling is performed ﬁrst, followed by allocation; sometimes allocation is
performed ﬁrst, followed by scheduling; and sometimes allocation and scheduling are interleaved.
