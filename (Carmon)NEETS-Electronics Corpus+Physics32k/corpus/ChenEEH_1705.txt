Feature-Based Modeling
Most of the focus on the problems of content-based video
indexing from the signal processing community concern the
modeling of visual content by using low-level features. Since
video is formed by a collection of images, most of the tech-
niques that model visual content rely on extracting image-like
features from the video sequence. Visual features can be ex-
tracted from keyframes or the sequence of frames after the
video sequence has been segmented into shots. This section
analyzes different low-level features used to represent the visual
content of a video shot.
