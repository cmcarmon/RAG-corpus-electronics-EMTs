In a series-connected multiterminal dc system (Fig. 61.11), all converters operate at the same current. One
converter sets the current that will be common to all converters in the system. Except for the converter that
sets the current, the remaining converters operate in voltage control mode (constant ﬁring angle or constant
extinction angle). The converters operate almost independently without requirement for high-speed commu-
nication between them. The power output of a non-current-controlling converter is varied by varying its voltage.
At all times, the sum of the voltages across the rectiﬁer stations must be larger than the sum of voltages across
the  inverter  stations.  Disadvantages  of  a  series-connected  system  are  (1)  reduced  efﬁciency  because  full  line
insulation is not used at all times and (2) operation at higher ﬁring angles will lead to high converter losses
and higher reactive power requirements from the ac system.
