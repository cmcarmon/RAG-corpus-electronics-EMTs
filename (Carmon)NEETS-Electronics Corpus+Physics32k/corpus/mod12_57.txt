The WAVELENGTH of a sine wave is determined by its physical length. During the period a wave 
is being generated, its leading edge is moving away from the source at 300,000,000 meters per second. 
The physical length of the sine wave is determined by the amount of time it takes to complete one full 
cycle. This wavelength is an important factor in determining the size of equipments used to generate and 
transmit radio frequencies.
