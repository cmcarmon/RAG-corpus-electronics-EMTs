A difference of potential can exist between two points, or bodies, only if they have different charges.
In other words, there is no difference in potential between two bodies if both have a deficiency of
electrons to the same degree. If, however, one body is deficient of 6 coulombs (representing 6 volts), and
the other is deficient by 12 coulombs (representing 12 volts), there is a difference of potential of 6 volts.
The body with the greater deficiency is positive with respect to the other.
