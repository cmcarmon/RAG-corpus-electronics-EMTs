at  the  steering  direction.  Consequently,  a  signal  tends  to  be  regarded  as  an  unwanted  interference  and  is,
therefore, suppressed in the beamformed output unless it is almost exactly aligned with the steering direction.
Therefore, it is desirable to broaden the signal acceptance angle while at the same time preserving the optimum
beamformerâ€™s ability to reject noise and interference outside this region of angles. One way of achieving this
is by the application of the principle of superdirectivity.
