 are used for conversions that must take place over a long period of time, such as
digital  voltmeter  applications  or  sensor  applications  such  as  thermocouples.  The  integrating  A/D  converter
produces a digital code that represents the average of the signal over time. Noise is reduced by means of the
signal averaging, or integration. Dual-slope integration is accomplished by a counter that advances while an
 This is compared to another count sequence
input voltage charges a capacitor in a speciÔ¨Åed time interval, 
 The ratio
that advances while a reference voltage discharges across the same capacitor in a time interval, 
of the charging count value to the discharging count value is proportional to the ration of the input voltage to
the reference voltage. Hence, the integrating converter provides a digital code that is a measure of the input
voltage averaged over time. The conversion accuracy is independent of the capacitor and the clock frequency
since  they  affect  both  the  charging  and  discharging  operations.  The  charging  period,  T,  is  selected  to  be  the
