Intersection of the Root Loci with the Imaginary Axis. The points where the root loci intersect the imaginary
axis (if there is any) in the s plane, and the corresponding values of K, may be determined by means of the
Routh-Hurwitz  stability  criterion  [Kuo,  1991a].  The  root  locus  program  can  also  be  used  on  a  computer  to
give the intersects.
