Consider the situation in which there are now two particles in nearby circular polar orbits of the earth at radius



r


{\displaystyle r}
and speed



v


{\displaystyle v}
.
The particles execute simple harmonic motion about the earth and with respect to each other. They are at their maximum distance from each other as they cross the equator. Their trajectories intersect at the poles.
Imagine we have a spacecraft co-moving with one of the particles. The ceiling of the craft, the







z

´





{\displaystyle {\acute {\mathbf {z} }}}
direction, coincides with the




r



{\displaystyle \mathbf {r} }
direction. The front of the craft is in the







x

´





{\displaystyle {\acute {\mathbf {x} }}}
direction, and the







y

´





{\displaystyle {\acute {\mathbf {y} }}}
direction is to the left of the craft. The spacecraft is small compared with the size of the orbit so that the local frame is a local Lorentz frame. The 4-separation of the two particles is given by

μ




{\displaystyle {\acute {x}}^{\mu }}
. In the local frame of the spacecraft the geodesic equation is given by
