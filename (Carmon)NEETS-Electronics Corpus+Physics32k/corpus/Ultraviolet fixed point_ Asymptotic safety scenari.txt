Steven Weinberg has proposed that the problematic UV divergences appearing in quantum theories of gravity may be cured by means of a nontrivial UV fixed point. Such an asymptotically safe theory is renormalizable in a nonperturbative sense, and due to the fixed point physical quantities are free from divergences. As yet, a general proof for the existence of the fixed point is still lacking, but there is mounting evidence for this scenario.
