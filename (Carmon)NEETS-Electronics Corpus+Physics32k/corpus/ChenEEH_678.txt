Next, a brief literature overview is presented of some inter-
esting evolutions of current and future stand-alone RAM
memory circuit organizations in different contexts. In particu-
lar, three different ‘‘directions’’ will be highlighted describing
the apparent targets of memory vendors. They differ namely in
terms of their mostly emphasized cost functions: power, speed,
or density. Some of these directions can be combined, but
several of them are noncompatible. One conclusion of this
literature study is that the main emphasis in almost all direc-
tions is on the access structure and not on the way the actual
