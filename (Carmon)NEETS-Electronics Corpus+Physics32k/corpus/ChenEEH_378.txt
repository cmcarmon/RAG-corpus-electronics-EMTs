where a ﬁrst-order term (i.e., k2j ¼ 0) will appear if m is odd.
The roots of Nm(s) are the transmission zeros of T(s) and may
lie anywhere in the s plane. Thus, the signs of kij are unre-
stricted. For example, k1j ¼ 0 for transmission zeros on the jv
axis. Assuming now m ¼ n, the following is true:
