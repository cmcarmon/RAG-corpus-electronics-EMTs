The choice of parameters can be based also upon the ease of analysis. For example, Table 3.3 shows that “T”
networks lend themselves to easy evaluation of the z parameters, while y parameters can be easily evaluated for
“P” networks. Table 3.3 summarizes other suggested uses and selections of network parameters for a few speciﬁc
cases. When electric circuits are interconnected, a judicious choice of parameters can simplify the calculations
to ﬁnd the overall parameter description for the interconnected networks. For example, Table 3.3 shows that
the z parameters for series-connected networks are simply the sum of the z parameters of the individual circuits
(see Ruston et al., [1966] for derivations of the parameters for some of the interconnected networks). The bold
entries imply 2 · 2 matrices containing the four parameters. For example,
