Shift registers are constructed of flip-flops wired 
together. Flip-flops have all the functions necessary for 
a register: They can be reset, preset, toggled, or steered 
to a 1 or 0 level. Figure 44-24 shows a basic shift regis-
ter constructed from four flip-flops. It is called a 4-bit 
shift register because it consists of four binary storage 
elements. A significant feature of the shift register is 
that it can move data to the right or left a number of bit 
positions. This is equivalent to multiplying or divid-
ing a number by a specific factor. The data are shifted
