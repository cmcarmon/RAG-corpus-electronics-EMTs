To understand how the unique grid construction of a variable-mu tube works, we will first examine
the grid operation of a conventional tube during cutoff. Look at figure 2-7. Here, you see a diagram of a
conventional sharp-cutoff triode with zero volts applied to the control grid. In view A, the majority of the
electrostatic lines of force leave the positive plate (+) and travel unhindered between the evenly spaced
grid wires to the negative cathode (-). Electrons emitted by the cathode travel along these lines from the
cathode, through the grid spacings, to the plate.
