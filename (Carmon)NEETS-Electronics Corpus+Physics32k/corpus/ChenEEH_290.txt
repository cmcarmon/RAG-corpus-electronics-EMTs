The effect of series resistance is to degrade output voltage levels
(push them away from the rails). Series resistance can be present
in the supply rail and/or the ground rail. Each series resistance
has a different effect on the output characteristics. Ground rail
resistance degrades VOL and supply rail resistance degrades VOH .
For example, consider the CMOS inverter shown in Figure
2.6(A) that includes a ground resistance Rseries. The output
voltage, VO, can be modeled [see Figure 2.6(B)] as a resistorâ€“
divider network such that:
