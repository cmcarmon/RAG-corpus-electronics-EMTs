The worm-like chain model (WLC) takes the energy required to bend a molecule into account. The variables are the same except that




L

p





{\displaystyle L_{p}\,}
, the persistence length, replaces



b



{\displaystyle b\,}
. Then, the force follows this equation:

{\displaystyle F\approx {\frac {k_{B}T}{L_{p}}}\left({\frac {1}{4\left(1-{\frac {r}{L_{c}}}\right)^{2}}}-{\frac {1}{4}}+{\frac {r}{L_{c}}}\right)\,}

Therefore, when there is no distance between chain ends (r=0), the force required to do so is zero, and to fully extend the polymer chain (



r
=

L

c





{\displaystyle r=L_{c}\,}
), an infinite force is required, which is intuitive. Graphically, the force begins at the origin and initially increases linearly with



r



{\displaystyle r\,}
. The force then plateaus but eventually increases again and approaches infinity as the chain length approaches
