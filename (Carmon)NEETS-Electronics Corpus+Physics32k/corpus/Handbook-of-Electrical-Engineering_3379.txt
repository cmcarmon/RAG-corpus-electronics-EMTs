The typical LiNbO3 device is packaged in a metallic case with optical ﬁber pigtails connected at both ends.
Electrical connections are provided by RF connectors or pins, which are common in the electronics industry.
If  hermetically  sealed  packages  are  desired,  then  the  optical  ﬁber  pigtails  must  be  hermetically  sealed  to  the
metallic package.
