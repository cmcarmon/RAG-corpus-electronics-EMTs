What we want to know is for what value of gain, K, and at what frequency, w, will the denominator of the
transfer function (12.9) become zero. Or, when will KGH = –1, meaning, when will the magnitude of KGH
equal 1 with a phase angle of –180 degrees? These parameters can be determined easily with a Bode diagram.
Construct a Bode diagram for KGH of the system, look at the frequency where the phase angle equals –180
degrees, and look up at the magnitude plot. If it is smaller than 1.0, then the system is stable. If it is larger than
1.0, then the system is unstable. Bode diagram techniques are discussed in Chapter 11.
