The battery keeps pushing electrons onto one plate (and pulling electrons 
off the other plate) until the voltage drop across the capacitor plates is equal 
to the battery voltage. At this equilibrium point, there is no voltage differen-
tial between the battery and the capacitor, so there’s no push for electrons 
to flow from the battery to the capacitor. The capacitor stops charging, and 
electrons stop moving through the circuit — and the light bulb goes out.
