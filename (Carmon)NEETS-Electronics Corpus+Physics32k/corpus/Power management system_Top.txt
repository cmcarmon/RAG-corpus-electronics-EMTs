On marine vessels the Power Management System PMS is in charge of controlling the electrical system. Its task is to make sure that the electrical system is safe and efficient. If the power consumption is larger than the power production capacity, load shedding is used to avoid blackout. Other features could be to automatic start and stop consumers (e.g., diesel generators) as the load varies.
