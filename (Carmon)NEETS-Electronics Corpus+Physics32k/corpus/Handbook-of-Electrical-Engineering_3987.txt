The decreasing electron velocity with electric ﬁeld characteristic for compound semiconductors such as GaAs
and InP makes possible active two-terminal devices called transferred electron devices (TEDs) or Gunn diodes.
The negative slope of the velocity versus electric ﬁeld characteristic implies a decreasing current with increasing
voltage. That is, the device has a negative resistance. When a properly sized piece of these materials is biased
and placed in a resonant cavity, the device will be unstable up to very high frequencies. By proper selection of
embedding impedances oscillators or ampliﬁers can be constructed.
