If  you  ever  see  references  to  the  voltage  at 
a  single  point  in  a  circuit,  it  is  always  with 
respect to the voltage at another point in the  
circuit  â€”  usually  the  reference  ground,  or 
common ground (often simply called ground), 
the point in the circuit that is (arbitrarily) said 
to be at 0 volts. Often, the negative terminal of 
a battery is used as the reference ground, and 
all voltages throughout the circuit are measured 
with respect to that reference point.
An analogy that may help you understand that 
voltage  measurement  is  distance  measure-
