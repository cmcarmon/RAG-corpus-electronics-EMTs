The stress-strain constitutive relation for linear materials is commonly known as Hooke's law. In its simplest form, the law defines the spring constant (or elasticity constant) k in a scalar equation, stating the tensile/compressive force is proportional to the extended (or contracted) displacement x:





F

i


=
−
k

x

i





{\displaystyle F_{i}=-kx_{i}\,}

meaning the material responds linearly. Equivalently, in terms of the stress σ, Young's modulus E, and strain ε (dimensionless):




σ
=
E

ε



{\displaystyle \sigma =E\,\varepsilon \,}

In general, forces which deform solids can be normal to a surface of the material (normal forces), or tangential (shear forces), this can be described mathematically using the stress tensor:

{\displaystyle \sigma _{ij}=C_{ijkl}\,\varepsilon _{kl}\,\rightleftharpoons \,\varepsilon _{ij}=S_{ijkl}\,\sigma _{kl}\,}

where C is the elasticity tensor and S is the compliance tensor
