The pole pieces (marked N and S) provide the magnetic field. The pole pieces are shaped and 
positioned as shown to concentrate the magnetic field as close as possible to the wire loop. The loop of 
wire that rotates through the field is called the ARMATURE. The ends of the armature loop are connected 
to rings called SLIP RINGS. They rotate with the armature. The brushes, usually made of carbon, with 
wires attached to them, ride against the rings. The generated voltage appears across these brushes.
