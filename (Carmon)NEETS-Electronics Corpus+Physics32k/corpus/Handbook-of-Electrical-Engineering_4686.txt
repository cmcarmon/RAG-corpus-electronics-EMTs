Single-phase unidirectional transducers (SPUDT) use spatial offsets between mechanical electrode reﬂections
and  electrical  regeneration  to  launch  a  SAW  in  one  direction.  A  reﬂecting  structure  may  be  made  of  metal
electrodes,  dielectric  strips,  or  grooved  reﬂectors  which  are  properly  placed  within  a  transduction  structure.
Under  proper  design  and  electrical  matching  conditions,  the  mechanical  reﬂections  can  exactly  cancel  the
electrical regeneration in one direction of the wave over a moderate band of frequencies. This is schematically
illustrated in Fig. 47.10 which shows a reﬂector structure and a transduction structure merged to form a SPUDT.
The transducer needs to be properly matched to the load for optimum operation. The mechanical reﬂections
can be controlled by modifying the width, position, or height of the individual reﬂector. The regenerated SAW
is primarily controlled by the electrical matching to the load of the transduction structure. SPUDT ﬁlters have
