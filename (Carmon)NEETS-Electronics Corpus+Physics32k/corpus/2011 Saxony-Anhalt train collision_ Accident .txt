The local passenger train with about 45 to 50 passengers on board was approaching the end of a single-track section at approximately 100 km/h (62 mph), where it collided head-on in very foggy conditions with the freight train, which was travelling at about 80 km/h (50 mph). Both trains had reduced their speeds prior to impact â€“ while the freight train slowed only marginally to 68 km/h (42 mph), an emergency brake application on the passenger train had slowed it down from 98 to 66 km/h (61 to 41 mph). The impact derailed the passenger train, which fell on its side next to the track. The front part of the passenger train was crushed. The freight train ran on for another 500 metres (1,600 ft) before coming to a halt.
Subsequent investigations showed that the freight train had most likely passed a signal at danger, as well as the preceding distant signal giving advance warning of the stop signal ahead. The line had been on the list for installation of the PZB automatic train protection system for years, but at the time of the accident this had not been carried out and there were only visual signals. When the freight train ran through the points, which were already set for the passenger train, the signalman in the signal box at Hordorf was alerted. He testified that he immediately radioed an instruction to stop via Zugbahnfunk but got no response until after the collision, which occurred just seconds later.
Since many people were severely injured, it was considered likely that the death toll could rise in the immediate aftermath of the incident. The nine killed passengers had lived in the Harz region; the driver of the passenger train, who was also killed, came from Mecklenburg.
