Observe further that the restrictions in Figure 6.46 imply that a non-
inverting device such as a buffer or an AND gate must convert an input low to
high transition of the form VIL → VIH to an output low to high transition of
the form VOL (or lower) → VOH (or higher). This scenario is depicted by the
arrows in Figure 6.46. The same situation is described using input and output
waveforms in Figure 6.47. It is clear from the figures that a static discipline
