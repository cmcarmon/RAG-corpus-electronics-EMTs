The color triangle formes
by velocity vector u,c,w call 'triangle velocity" this is an important role in old academic, this rule was helpful to detail Eq.(1) become Eq.(2) and wide explained how the pump works.





c

1





{\displaystyle c_{1}\,}
and




c

2





{\displaystyle c_{2}\,}
are the absolute velocities at the inlet and outlet respectively.





w

1





{\displaystyle w_{1}\,}
and




w

2





{\displaystyle w_{2}\,}
are the relative velocities at the inlet and outlet respectively.





u

1





{\displaystyle u_{1}\,}
and




u

2





{\displaystyle u_{2}\,}
are the velocities of the blade at the inlet and outlet respectively.




Ï‰


{\displaystyle \omega }
is angular velocity.
Fig 1 shows triangle velocity of backward curved vanes impeller ; it's illustrate rather clearly energy add to the flow (shown in vector c) inversely change upon flow rate Q (shown in vector cm).
