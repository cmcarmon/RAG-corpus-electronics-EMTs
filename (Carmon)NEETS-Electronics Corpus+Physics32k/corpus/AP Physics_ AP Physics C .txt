The College Board offers two courses in the AP Physics C suite, each equivalent to a semester-length calculus-based college course for majors in physical science or engineering:
AP Physics C: Mechanics studies Newtonian mechanics, with units on kinematics; Newtonâ€™s laws of motion; work, energy, and power; systems of particles and linear momentum; circular motion and rotation; and oscillations and gravitation.
AP Physics C: Electricity and Magnetism studies electricity and magnetism, covering electrostatics; conductors, capacitors, and dielectrics; electric circuits; magnetic fields; and electromagnetism.
The two AP Physics C courses can be combined to make a unified Physics C course that prepares for both exams.
