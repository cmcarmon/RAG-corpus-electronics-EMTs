In order to integrate computer-aided circuit analysis, two types of programs have been
introduced in this text: A circuit simulator PSpice and a math solver MATLAB. Our purpose
here is not to teach students how to use speciﬁc software packages, but to help them develop
an analysis style that includes the intelligent use of computer tools. After all, these tools are
an intrinsic part of the engineering environment, which can signiﬁcantly enhance the student’s
understanding of circuit phenomena.
