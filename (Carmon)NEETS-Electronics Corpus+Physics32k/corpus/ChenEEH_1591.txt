Given a ﬁxed reasoning method, the process of searching
through alternative solutions can be affected through the
structuring and ordering of the rules in implementations. For
example, in production systems, a rule of the form ‘‘if p and q
and r then s’’ may be interpreted in backward chaining as a
procedure of four steps: to do s, ﬁrst do p, then do q, then do
r. Although the procedural interpretation of rules reduces the
advantages of declarative representation, it can be used to
reﬂect more efﬁcient heuristic solution strategies. For instance,
the premises of a rule may be ordered so that the one that is
most likely to fail or is easiest to be satisﬁed will be tried ﬁrst.
