Skew Parameter Files
This  chapter  discussed  obtaining  model  parameters  for  a  single  wafer,  usually  one  that  has  been  chosen  to
represent a typical wafer for the technology being characterized. The parameter values obtained from this wafer
correspond to a typical case. Circuit designers also want to simulate circuits with parameter values representing
the extremes of process variation, the so-called fast and slow corners, or skew parameter Ô¨Åles. These represent
the best and worst case of the process variation over time.
