Thermomagnetic process: The process of recording and erasure in magneto-optical media, involving local
heating of the medium by a focused laser beam, followed by the formation or annihilation of a reverse-
magnetized domain. The successful completion of the process usually requires an external magnetic Ô¨Åeld
to assist the reversal of the magnetization.
