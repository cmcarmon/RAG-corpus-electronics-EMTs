Generators
Three-phase synchronous generators produce the overwhelm-
ing majority of electricity in modern power systems. Syn-
chronous machines operate by applying a dc excitation to a
rotor that, when mechanically rotated, induces a voltage in the
armature windings due to changing ﬂux linkage. The per phase
ﬂux for a balanced connection can be written as:
