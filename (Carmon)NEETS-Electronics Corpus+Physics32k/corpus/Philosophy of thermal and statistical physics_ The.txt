In simplest terms, the First Law states that the internal energy level of an isolated system is a constant. In the context of a non-isolated system, this law requires that when there is a change in energy when going from one equilibrium state to another, that change is equal to the heat transfer into the system minus the work done by the system. Hence energy in minus energy out equals the change in energy.
The understanding of the First Law embodied in classical physics can be summarized by the saying: "Energy can be neither created nor destroyed."
Because of the:
Mass-energy equivalence that is a consequence of special relativity (famously summarised for particles at rest by the equation E=mc2.);
Standard Model of particle physics;
Spontaneous emergence of elementary particles out of the vacuum, as explained by quantum theory, and the equally spontaneous decay of single particles and the mutual annihilation of particles and anti-particles,
the above classical version of the First Law must be amended as follows:
"The total energy of the universe, including the energy equivalent of all baryons, bosons, and leptons in the universe, is constant for all time."
