of a constant voltage source, a linear resistor, and an exponen-
tial diode is shown in Figure 5.4. Circuit equations can be
solved using a graphical method. The solution is the circuit’s
dc operating point, found as the intersection of the diode
characteristics and the ‘‘load line.’’ The load line is obtained
by applying Kirchhoff ’s voltage law to the single circuit’s
loop.
