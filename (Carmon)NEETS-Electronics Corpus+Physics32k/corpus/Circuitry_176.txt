Practical investigation  
 
Objective 
 
To  investigate  the  charge  and  discharge  of  a 
capacitor.  
 
Components and test equipment 
Breadboard, 9V DC power source (either a PP9 9V 
battery or an AC mains adapter with a 9V 400mA 
output), digital multimeter with test leads, resistors 
of 100 kF, 220 kF and 47 kF, capacitor of 1,000 
µF, insulated wire links (various lengths), assorted 
crocodile  leads,  short  lengths  of  black,  red,  and 
green insulated solid wire. A watch or clock with a 
seconds display will also be required for timing.  
 
Procedure 
 
Connect  the  charging  circuit  shown  in  Fig.  3.40 
with  R = 100  kF and  C = 1,000  µF.  Place  a 
temporary  shorting  link  across  the  capacitor.  Set 
the  meter  to  the  20  V  DC  range  and  remove  the 
shorting  link.  Measure  and  record  the  capacitor 
voltage at 25 s intervals over the range 0 to 250 s 
after removing the shorting link. Record your result 
in  a  table  showing  capacitor  voltage  against  time. 
Repeat with R = 220 kF and R = 47 kF.
