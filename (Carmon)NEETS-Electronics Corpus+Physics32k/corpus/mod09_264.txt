View (C) is the feedback network which uses L1 (the collector load) as the primary and L2 as the 
secondary winding of a coupling transformer to provide a 180-degree phase shift. Variable resistor R1 
controls the amount of current through L1. When R1 is adjusted for maximum resistance, most of the 
current flows through L1. The transformer now couples a maximum signal which represents a large 
feedback amplitude into the tank circuit (L2, C1). If R1 is adjusted for a smaller resistance, less current
