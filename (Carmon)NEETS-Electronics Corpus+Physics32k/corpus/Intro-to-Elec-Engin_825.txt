Along with increases in load growth, there have been continuing increases in the size of
generating units and in steam temperatures and pressure, leading to savings in fuel costs and
overall operating costs. Ac transmission voltages in the United States have also been rising
steadily: 115, 138, 161, 230, 345, 500, and now 765 kV. Ultrahigh voltages (UHV) above 1000
kV are now being studied. Some of the reasons for increased transmission voltages are:
