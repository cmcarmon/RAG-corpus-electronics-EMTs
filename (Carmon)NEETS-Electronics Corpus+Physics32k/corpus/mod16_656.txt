An oscilloscope can be used for several different types of measurements, such as time, phase,
frequency, and amplitude of observed waveforms. Earlier in this chapter, you learned that the
oscilloscope is most often used to study the shapes of waveforms when the performance of equipment is
being checked. The patterns on the scope are compared with the signals that should appear at test points
(according to the technical manual for the equipment under test). You can then determine if the
equipment is operating according to peak performance standards.
