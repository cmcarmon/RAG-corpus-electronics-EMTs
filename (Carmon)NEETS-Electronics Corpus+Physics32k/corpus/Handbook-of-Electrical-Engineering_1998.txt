Implementation of a Finite Impulse Response Filter with the TMS320C30
Consider  again  the  convolution  equation,  Eq.  (18.1),  which  represents  an  FIR  ﬁlter.  Table  18.2  shows  the
TMS320C30 memory organization used for the coefﬁcients and the input samples. Initially, all the input samples
can  be  set  to  zero.  The  newest  sample  x(n),  at  time  n,  can  be  retrieved  from  an  ADC  using  the  following
instructions:
