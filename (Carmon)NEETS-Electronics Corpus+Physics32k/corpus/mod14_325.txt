Now let’s subtract 102 from 112 using the adder/subtracter circuit. The minuend (112) is input on the
A terminals, and the subtrahend (102) is input on the B terminals. In the subtract mode, a 1 from the
control circuit is input to each of the X-OR gates and to the C0 carry input. By applying a 1 to each of the
X-OR gates, you find the output will be the complement of the subtrahend input at B1 and B2. Since B1 is
a 0, the output of X-OR 1 will be 1. The input B2 to X-OR 2 will be inverted to a 0. The HIGH input to C0
acts as a carry from a previous circuit. The combination of the X-OR gates and the HIGH at C0 produces
the R’s complement of the subtrahend. The full adders add the minuend and the R’s complement of the
subtrahend and produce the difference. The output of C2 is not used. The outputs of S2 and S1 are 0 and 1,
respectively, indicating a difference of 012. Therefore, 112 minus 102 equals 012.
