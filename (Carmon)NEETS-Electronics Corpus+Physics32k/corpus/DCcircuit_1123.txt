To date, the most successful fuel cells constructed are those which run on hydrogen and oxy-
gen, although much research has been done on cells using hydrocarbon fuels. While ”burning”
hydrogen, a fuel cell’s only waste byproducts are water and a small amount of heat. When op-
erating on carbon-containing fuels, carbon dioxide is also released as a byproduct. Because the
operating temperature of modern fuel cells is far below that of normal combustion, no oxides
of nitrogen (NOx) are formed, making it far less polluting, all other factors being equal.
