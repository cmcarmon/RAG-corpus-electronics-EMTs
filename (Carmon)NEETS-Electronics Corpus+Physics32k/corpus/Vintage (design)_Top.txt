In terms of design, "vintage" generally refers to any manmade object or objects that are around fifteen years old or older. A manmade object less than fifteen years old is referred to as "used" or "secondhand".
There can be debate over whether or not an item is vintage. Some vintage enthusiasts may say something as young as thirteen years old is vintage, whereas others (such as the e-commerce website Etsy) would say an item would have to be at least twenty years old for it to be considered vintage; however there is no legal definition of vintage when describing manmade objects.
The terms "retro", "vintage", and "antique" are sometimes used interchangeably and therefore can cause confusion as to what is really meant. The term "retro" (also known as "vintage inspired") refers to new manmade objects that are designed to resemble other manmade objects that are at least 15 years old or older. "Vintage" refers to the original (old) manmade objects the new designs are based on. So in simple terms, new manmade objects that look old are called "retro" and manmade objects that look old because they are old are called "vintage". "Antique" on the other hand simply refers to manmade objects that are 100 years old or older, although there can be debate about that as well; however, in most areas the legal definition of an antique is a manmade object that is at least a century old.
