The same type of constant expression can be found and removed with a global perspective, typically from within
loops. A simple example is the best way to describe how they can be removed and to offer some caveats when the
compiler cannot see the global picture. The following example code updates each element in the vector by adding
the  Ô¨Årst  element  scaled  by  a  constant  y. An  observation  shows  that  the  subexpression,  vector[0]  *  y,  is  constant
throughout all executions of the loop. An obvious improvement in code is to calculate the product of vector[0] *
y outside of the loop and store its value in a temporary variable. This is done in the second example.
