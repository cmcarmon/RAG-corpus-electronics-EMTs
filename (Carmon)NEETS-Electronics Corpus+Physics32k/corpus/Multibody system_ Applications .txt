While single bodies or parts of a mechanical system are studied in detail with finite element methods, the behavior of the whole multibody system is usually studied with multibody system methods within the following areas:
Aerospace engineering (helicopter, landing gears, behavior of machines under different gravity conditions)
Biomechanics
Combustion engine, gears and transmissions, chain drive, belt drive
Dynamic simulation* Vehicle simulation (vehicle dynamics, rapid prototyping of vehicles, improvement of stability, comfort optimization, improvement of efficiency, ...)
Hoist, conveyor, paper mill
Military applications
Particle simulation (granular media, sand, molecules)
Physics engine
Robotics
