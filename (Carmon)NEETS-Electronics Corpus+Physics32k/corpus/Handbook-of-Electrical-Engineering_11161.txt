where [H
] is the activity of the hydrogen ions in solution, a quantity that is related to the concentration of
the  hydrogen  ions.  This  sensor  only  works  in  an  aqueous  environment.  It  consists  of  an  inner  chamber
containing  an  electrolytic  solution  of  known  pH  and  an  outer  solution  with  an  unknown  pH  that  is  to  be
measured. The membrane consists of a specially formulated glass that will in essence allow hydrogen ions to
pass in either direction but will not pass other chemical species. If the concentration of hydrogen ions in the
external solution is greater than that in the internal solution, there will be a gradient forcing hydrogen ions to
diffuse through the membrane into the internal solution. This will cause the internal solution to have a greater
positive charge than the external solution so that an electrical potential and, hence, an electric ﬁeld will exist
across  the  membrane.  This  ﬁeld  will  counteract  the  diffusion  of  hydrogen  ions  due  to  the  concentration
difference  and  so  an  equilibrium  will  be  eventually  established.  The  potential  across  the  membrane  at  this
equilibrium  condition  will  be  related  to  the  hydrogen  ion  concentration  difference  (or  more  accurately  the
activity difference) between the inner and outer solutions. This potential is given by the Nernst equation
