The Describing Function Method
The describing function method, abbreviated as DF, was developed in several countries in the 1940s [Atherton,
1982],  to  answer  the  question: “What  are  the  necessary  and  sufﬁcient  conditions  for  the  nonlinear  feedback
system of Fig. 100.42 to be stable?” The problem still remains unanswered for a system with static nonlinearity,
n(x), and linear plant G(s). All of the original investigators found limit cycles in control systems and observed
that, in many instances with structures such as Fig. 100.42, the wave form of the oscillation at the input to the
nonlinearity was almost sinusoidal. If, for example, the nonlinearity in Fig. 100.42 is an ideal relay, that is has
an on-off characteristic, so that an odd symmetrical input wave form will produce a square wave at its output,
the output of G(s) will be almost sinusoidal when G(s) is a low pass ﬁlter which attenuates the higher harmonics
in the square wave much more than the fundamental. It was, therefore, proposed that the nonlinearity should
be represented by its gain to a sinusoid and that the conditions for sustaining a sinusoidal limit cycle be evaluated
to assess the stability of the feedback loop. Because of the nonlinearity, this gain in response to a sinusoid is a
function of the amplitude of the sinusoid and is known as the describing function. Because describing function
methods can be used other than for a single sinusoidal input, the technique is referred to as the single sinusoidal
DF or sinusoidal DF.
