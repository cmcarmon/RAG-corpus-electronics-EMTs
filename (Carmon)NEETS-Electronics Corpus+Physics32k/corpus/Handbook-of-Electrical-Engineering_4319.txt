Wave Equation for Dielectric Materials
Only certain discrete angles, instead of all acceptance angles less than the maximum acceptance angle, lead to
guided  propagation  in  lightwave  waveguides.  Hence,  ray  theory  is  inadequate,  and  wave  theory  is  necessary,
for analysis of light propagation in optical waveguides.
