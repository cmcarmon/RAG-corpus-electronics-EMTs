In the past 15 years, the electronics industry has seen a tremendous surge in the development of new semicon-
ductor materials, novel devices, and circuits. For the designer to bring these circuits or devices to the market
in a timely fashion, he or she must have design tools capable of predicting the device behavior in a variety of
circuit  conÔ¨Ågurations  and  environmental  conditions.  Equivalent  circuit  models  and  semiconductor  device
simulators represent such design tools.
