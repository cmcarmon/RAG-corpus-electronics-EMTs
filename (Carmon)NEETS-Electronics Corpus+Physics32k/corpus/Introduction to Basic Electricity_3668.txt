It should be realized that the filter capacitor places 
additional stress on the diodes used in the rectifier 
circuit. A half-wave rectifier and a full-wave recti-
fier, each followed by a filter capacitor, are shown in 
 FigureÂ 36-18. The capacitor charges to the peak value 
of the secondary voltage and holds this value through-
out the input cycle. When the diode becomes reverse 
biased, it shuts off, and a maximum negative voltage 
is felt on the anode of the diode. The filter capacitor 
holds a maximum positive voltage on the cathode of 
the diode. The difference of potential across the diode 
is twice the peak value of the secondary. The diode 
must be selected to withstand this voltage.
