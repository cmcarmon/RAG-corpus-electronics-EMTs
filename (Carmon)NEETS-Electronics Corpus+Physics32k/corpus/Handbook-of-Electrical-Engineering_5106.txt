MSW-Based Guided-Wave Magnetooptic Bragg Cell
When a ferrimagnet is placed in a sufﬁciently large externally applied dc magnetic ﬁeld, H0, the ferrimagnetic
materials become magnetically saturated to produce a saturation magnetization 4pMS. Under this condition,
each individual magnetic dipole will precess in resonance with frequency fres = gH0 where g  is the gyromagnetic
ratio  (g  =  2.8  MHz/Oe).  However,  due  to  the  dipole–dipole  coupling  and  quantum  mechanical  exchange
coupling,  the  collective  interactions  among  neighboring  magnetic  dipole  moments  produce  a  continuum
spectrum  of  precession  modes  or  spin  waves  at  frequency  bands  near  fres.  Exchange-free  spin  wave  spectra
obtained under the magnetostatic approximation are known as magnetostatic waves (MSWs) [Ishak, 1988]. In
essence, MSWs are relatively slow propagating, dispersive, magnetically dominated electromagnetic (EM) waves
which  exist  in  biased  ferrites  at  microwave  frequencies  (2–20  GHz).  In  a  ferrimagnetic  ﬁlm  with  a  ﬁnite
thickness, such as a YIG thin ﬁlm epitaxially grown on a nonmagnetic substrate such as GGG, MSW modes
are  classiﬁed  into  three  types:  magnetostatic  surface  wave  (MSSW),  magnetostatic  forward  volume  wave
(MSFVW),  and  magnetostatic  backward  volume  wave  (MSBVW),  depending  on  the  orientation  of  the  dc
magnetic  ﬁeld  with  respect  to  the  ﬁlm  plane  and  the  propagation  direction  of  the  MSW.  At  a  constant  dc
magnetic ﬁeld, each type of mode only exists in a certain frequency band. An important feature of MSW is
that these frequency bands can be simply tuned by changing the dc magnetic ﬁeld.
