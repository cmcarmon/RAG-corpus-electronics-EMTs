Up to this point, four of the most important electrical quantities have been discussed. These are
voltage (E), current (I), resistance (R), and power (P). You must understand the relationships which exist
among these quantities because they are used throughout your study of electricity. In the preceding
paragraphs, P was expressed in terms of alternate pairs of the other three basic quantities E, I, and R. In
practice, you should be able to express any one of these quantities in terms of any two of the others.
