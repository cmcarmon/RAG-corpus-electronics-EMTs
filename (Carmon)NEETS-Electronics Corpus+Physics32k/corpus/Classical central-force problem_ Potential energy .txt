A central force is always a conservative force; the magnitude F(r) of a central force can always be expressed as the derivative of a time-independent potential energy function U(r)

{\displaystyle F(r)=-{\frac {dU}{dr}}}

Thus, the total energy of the particle—the sum of its kinetic energy and its potential energy U—is a constant; energy is said to be conserved. To show this, it suffices that the work W done by the force depends only on initial and final positions, not on the path taken between them.

{\displaystyle W=\int _{\mathbf {r} _{1}}^{\mathbf {r} _{2}}\mathbf {F} \cdot d\mathbf {r} =\int _{\mathbf {r} _{1}}^{\mathbf {r} _{2}}F(r){\hat {\mathbf {r} }}\cdot d\mathbf {r} =\int _{r_{1}}^{r_{2}}Fdr=U(r_{1})-U(r_{2})}

Equivalently, it suffices that the curl of the force field F is zero; using the formula for the curl in spherical coordinates,

{\displaystyle \nabla \times \mathbf {F} ={\frac {1}{r\sin \theta }}\left({\frac {\partial F}{\partial \varphi }}\right){\hat {\boldsymbol {\theta }}}-{\frac {1}{r}}\left({\frac {\partial F}{\partial \theta }}\right){\hat {\boldsymbol {\varphi }}}=0}

because the partial derivatives are zero for a central force; the magnitude F does not depend on the angular spherical coordinates θ and φ.
Since the scalar potential V(r) depends only on the distance r to the origin, it has spherical symmetry. In this respect, the central-force problem is analogous to the Schwarzschild geodesics in general relativity and to the quantum mechanical treatments of particles in potentials of spherical symmetry.
