Although  we  have  derived  an  approximate  model  of  an  actual  source,  another  equivalent  form  may  be
obtained.  This  alternative  form  is  shown  in  Fig.  2.9(c)  and  consists  of  the  parallel  combination  of  an  ideal
independent current source,  IS = V S/RS, and the same resistance,  RS, used in the previous model. Although it
may seem strange to model an automobile battery using a current source, the model is completely equivalent
to the series voltage source–resistor model of Fig. 2.9(b) at the output terminals a–b. This is shown by writing
Kirchhoff ’s current law at the upper node to give
