A crystal microphone has a high impedance and does not require an external voltage source. It can 
be connected directly into the input circuit of a high-gain amplifier. However, because its output is low, 
several stages of high-gain amplification are required. Crystal microphones are delicate and must be 
handled with care. Exposure to temperatures above 52 degrees Celsius (125 degrees Fahrenheit) may 
permanently damage the crystal unit. Crystals are also soluble in water and other liquids and must be 
protected from moisture and excessive humidity.
