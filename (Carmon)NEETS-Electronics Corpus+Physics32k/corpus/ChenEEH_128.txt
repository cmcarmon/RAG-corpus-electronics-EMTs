where all conductances and constants arising in the formula-
tion are stored in the matrix G and all capacitor and inductor
values are stored in the matrix C. In addition, the connection
of the input source to the circuit is in d, the vector of nodal
voltages and some branch currents needed for MNA is v(t),
and the initial condition vector is v0.
