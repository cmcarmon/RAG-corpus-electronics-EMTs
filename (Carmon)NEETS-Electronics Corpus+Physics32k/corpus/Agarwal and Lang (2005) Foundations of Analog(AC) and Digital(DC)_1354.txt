This problem examines in more detail why energy is lost when
the switch in Figure 9.71 closes. To do so, we examine the transient that occurs during
the closure of the switch. In preparation for this, let t = 0 be the time at which the
switch first begins to close, and let t = T be the time at which the circuit reaches steady
state. The charges on the two capacitors prior to switch closure are given to be Q1
and Q2.
Further, let q1(t) be any function defined over the interval 0 ≤ t ≤ T such that
