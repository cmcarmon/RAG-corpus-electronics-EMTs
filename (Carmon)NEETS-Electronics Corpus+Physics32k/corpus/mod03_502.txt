Figure 3-15 is used to explain the method of using an ohmmeter to check a switch. Figure 3-15(A)
shows the toggle positions and schematic diagrams for the three switch positions. Figure 3-15(B) shows
the ohmmeter connections used to check the switch while the toggle is in position 1. Figure 3-15(C) is a
table showing the switch position, ohmmeter connection, and correct ohmmeter reading for those
conditions.
