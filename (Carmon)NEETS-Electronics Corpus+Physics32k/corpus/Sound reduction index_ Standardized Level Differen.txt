Similar to the normalized level difference, this index corrects the measured difference to a standardized reverberation time. For dwellings, the standard reverberation time used is 0.5 seconds, for other larger spaces longer reverberation times will be used. 0.5 seconds is often cited as approximately average for a medium-sized, carpeted and furnished living room. Due to not requiring detailed and accurate knowledge of the dimensions of the test rooms, this index is easier to obtain, and arguably of slightly more relevance.
Once the difference level or sound reduction index is obtained, the weighted value may be obtained from the corrected spectrum as described above from the reference curve.
