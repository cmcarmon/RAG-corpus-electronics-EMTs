In the circuit in Figure 10.77, R1 = 1 k, R2 = 2 k, and
e x e r c i s e 10.16
C = 3 ÂµF. Assume initial rest conditions (zero initial state), and assume that v1 has a
6-volt step at t = 0. Find v2(t) for t > 0. Sketch and label.
e x e r c i s e 10.17 Consider the circuit shown in Figure 10.78. Sketch and label
vO(t) for i1(t) a step as shown in Figure 10.79. Assume vO = 0 for t < 0.
