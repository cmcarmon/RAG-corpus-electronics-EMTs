The battery polarities, of course, remain as they were according to their symbology (short
end negative, long end positive). It is OK if the polarity of a resistor’s voltage drop doesn’t
match with the polarity of the nearest battery, so long as the resistor voltage polarity is cor-
rectly based on the assumed direction of current through it. In some cases we may discover
that current will be forced backwards through a battery, causing this very effect. The impor-
tant thing to remember here is to base all your resistor polarities and subsequent calculations
on the directions of current(s) initially assumed. As stated earlier, if your assumption happens
to be incorrect, it will be apparent once the equations have been solved (by means of a negative
solution). The magnitude of the solution, however, will still be correct.
