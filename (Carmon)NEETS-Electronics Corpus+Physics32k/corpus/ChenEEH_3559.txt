Sampling refers to the process of obtaining a discrete-time
signal by extracting values of a continuous-time signal at
predetermined instants that are usually equally spaced. This
process maps a function with an uncountably inÔ¨Ånite domain
to a function with a countable domain. One would like the
mapping to be such as to allow an exact recovery of the
continuous-time signal from the sampled signal. The condi-
tions that allow a continuous-time signal to be reconstructed
from its samples can be obtained from examining the signal
Fourier transform. The main requirements are that
