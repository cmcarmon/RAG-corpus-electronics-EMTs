Now, letâ€™s vary the resistance and observe how the output is affected in figure 2-23. As the resistance
reaches a value greater than 10 times XC, the phase difference between input and output is nearly 0
degrees. For all practical purposes, the circuit is resistive. As the resistance is decreased to 1/10 the value
of X
