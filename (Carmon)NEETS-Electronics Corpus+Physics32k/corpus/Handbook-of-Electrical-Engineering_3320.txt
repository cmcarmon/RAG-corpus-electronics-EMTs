Photomultiplier Tubes
Photomultiplier  tubes  are  the  most  sensitive  light  sensors,  especially  for  visible  radiation.  Figure 31.12  is  a
schematic showing the electrical circuit used to bias it and form the output voltage signal. Light is incident on
the photocathode, and the resulting photoelectrons are accelerated to a series of dynodes to generate secondary
electrons and through this electron multiplication amplify the signal. Gains of 108 can be achieved with only
minor degradation of the linearity and speed of vacuum photodiodes. The spectral response is governed by
the emission properties of the photocathode.
