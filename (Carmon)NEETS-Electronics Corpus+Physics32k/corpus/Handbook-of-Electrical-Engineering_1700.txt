One immediately observes that both of the approaches discussed above are equivalent in that the energy is
sensed at various spatial locations of the object to be imaged. This energy is then converted to an electrical signal
by the transducer. The image formation processes just described are classical analog image formation, with the
distance between the sensor locations limiting the spatial resolution in the system. In the array sensors, resolution
is determined by how close the sensors are located in the array. In the single-sensor approach, the spatial resolution
is  limited  by  how  far  the  sensor  is  moved.  In  an  actual  system  spatial  resolution  is  also  determined  by  the
performance characteristics of the sensor. Here we are assuming for our purposes
