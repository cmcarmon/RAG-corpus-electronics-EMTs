This evolution is best characterized as a shift away from the mechanical lever view of a HLL toward HLLs
as notations for encoding abstractions. An abstraction is a model of the real world whose purpose is to de-
emphasize mundane details and highlight the important parts of a problem, system, or idea. Modern HLLs are
best suited to expressing such abstractions with little concern for the underlying computer hardware.
