Brightness (white light output) measures the total amount of light projected in lumens. The color brightness specification Color Light Output measures red, green, and blue each on a nine-point grid, using the same approach as that used to measure brightness. Experts advise projector buyers to make certain that white light output and color light output are equal for optimum viewing experiences.
