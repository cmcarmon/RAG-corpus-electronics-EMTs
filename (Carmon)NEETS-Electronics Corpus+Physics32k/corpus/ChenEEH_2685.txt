employed a uniform Cartesian grid having rectangular cells.
Staircasing was used to approximate the surface of structural
features not parallel to the grid coordinate axes. Later work
showed that it is possible to modify the size and shape of the
space cells located immediately adjacent to a structural feature
to conformally ﬁt its surface (Jurgens et al., 1992; Dey and
Mittra, 1997). This result is accurate and computationally
efﬁcient for large structures because the number of modiﬁed
cells is proportional to the surface area of the structure. Thus,
the number of modiﬁed cells becomes progressively smaller
relative to the number of regular cells ﬁlling the structure
volume as its size increases. As a result, the computer resources
needed to implement a fully conformal model approximate
those required for a staircased model. A key disadvantage of
this technique, however, is that special mesh-generation soft-
ware must be constructed.
