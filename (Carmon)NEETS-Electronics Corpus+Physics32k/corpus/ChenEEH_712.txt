In data transfer intensive applications, a costly and difﬁcult
issue to solve concerns getting the data to the processor quickly
enough. A certain amount of parallelism in the data transfers is
usually required to meet
the application’s real-time con-
straints. Parallel data transfers, however, can be very costly.
Therefore, the trade-off between data transfer bandwidth and
data transfer cost should be carefully explored. This section
describes the potential trade-offs involved and also introduces
a new way to systematically trade-off the data transfer cost
with other components (illustrated for total system energy
consumption).
