4.3
If a circuit has two or more independent sources, one way to determine
the  value  of  a  speciÔ¨Åc  variable  (voltage  or  current)  is  to  use  nodal  or
mesh  analysis  as  in  Chapter  3. Another  way  is  to  determine  the  con-
tribution of each independent source to the variable and then add them
up. The latter approach is known as the superposition.
