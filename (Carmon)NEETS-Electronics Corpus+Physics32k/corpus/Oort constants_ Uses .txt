One of the major uses of the Oort constants is to calibrate the galactic rotation curve. A relative curve can be derived from studying the motions of gas clouds in the Milky Way, but to calibrate the actual absolute speeds involved requires knowledge of V0. We know that:





V

0


=

R

0


(
A
−
B
)




{\displaystyle V_{0}=R_{0}(A-B)\,\!}

Since R0 can be determined by other means (such as by carefully tracking the motions of stars near the Milky Way's central supermassive black hole), knowing



A


{\displaystyle A}
and



B


{\displaystyle B}
allows us to determine V0.
It can also be shown that the mass density




ρ

R




{\displaystyle \rho _{R}}
can be given by:





ρ

=




B

{\displaystyle \rho _{R}={\frac {B^{2}-A^{2}}{2\pi G}}}

So the Oort constants can tell us something about the mass density at a given radius in the disk. They are also useful to constrain mass distribution models for the Galaxy. As well, in the epicyclic approximation for nearly circular stellar orbits in a disk, the epicyclic frequency



κ


{\displaystyle \kappa }
is given by

{\displaystyle \kappa ^{2}=-4B\Omega }
, where

{\displaystyle \Omega }
is the angular velocity. Therefore, the Oort constants can tell us a great deal about motions in the galaxy.
