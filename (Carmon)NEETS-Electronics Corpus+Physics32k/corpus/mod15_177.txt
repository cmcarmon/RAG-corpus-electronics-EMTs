The advent of long-range missiles and high-speed aircraft has brought about the need for accurately 
transmitting very large quantities. This is best done by a tri-speed synchro system, which transmits data at 
three different speeds. These speeds are sometimes referred to as coarse, medium or intermediate, and 
fine. A typical weapons systems, for example, might transmit range in miles, thousands of yards, and 
hundreds of yards. By providing this range in three different scales, greater accuracy is obtained than 
would be possible with a dual-speed system. Representative speeds for tri-speed systems include 1, 36, 
and 180; 1, 36, and 360; and 1, 18, and 648.
