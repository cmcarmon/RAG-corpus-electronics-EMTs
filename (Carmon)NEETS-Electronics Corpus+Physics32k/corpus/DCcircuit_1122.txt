A fascinating device closely related to primary-cell batteries is the fuel cell, so-called be-
cause it harnesses the chemical reaction of combustion to generate an electric current. The
process of chemical oxidation (oxygen ionically bonding with other elements) is capable of pro-
ducing an electron ï¬‚ow between two electrodes just as well as any combination of metals and
electrolytes. A fuel cell can be thought of as a battery with an externally supplied chemical
