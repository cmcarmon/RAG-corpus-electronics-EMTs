This system uses a motorized take-up reel which pulls the magnetic tape off of a free-spooling 
supply reel. It maintains tape tension by using mechanical drag on the supply reel. As you might guess, 
this method has its disadvantages. It only works in one direction, and the tape tension doesn't remain 
constant throughout the reel. As the supply reel gives out tape, the tape tension varies. Uneven tape 
tension can cause stretched tape, poorly wound tape reels, and tape damage during starts and stops.
