The principal advantage of the autotransformer is the increased power rating. Also, since the losses remain
the same, expressed as a percentage of the new rating, they go down, and correspondingly, the efÔ¨Åciency goes
up. The machine impedances in per unit drop for similar reasons. A disadvantage is the loss of electrical isolation
between primary and secondary. Also, low impedance is not necessarily good, as we shall see when we study
faults on power systems. Autotransformers are used in three-phase connections and in voltage control appli-
cations.
