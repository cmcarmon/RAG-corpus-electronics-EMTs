The second theorem states that the volume V of a solid of revolution generated by rotating a plane figure F about an external axis is equal to the product of the area A of F and the distance d traveled by its geometric centroid.




V
=
A

{\displaystyle V=Ad.}

For example, the volume of the torus with minor radius r and major radius R is




V
=
(

(

{\displaystyle V=(\pi r^{2})(2\pi R)=2\pi ^{2}Rr^{2}.}

This special case was derived by Johannes Kepler using infinitesimals.
