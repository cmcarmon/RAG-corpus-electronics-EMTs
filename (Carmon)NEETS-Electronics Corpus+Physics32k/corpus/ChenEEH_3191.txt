Under conditions of long-term corona or dry-band dis-
charge activity promoted by wetting and contamination
deposition, the RTV-coated insulator surface can lose its
hydrophobicity in those areas subjected to the discharges.
The hydrophobic loss is usually temporary, and the surface
will recover its hydrophobicity if the surface is dry for a few
hours. This is due to the dynamic nature of the silicone
polymer that allows polymer chains to migrate and reorient
