A SQUARE WAVE is shown in figure 3-1, view (B). As shown, it has two alternations of equal 
duration and a square presentation for each complete cycle. Figure 3-2 shows a breakdown of the square 
wave and is the figure you should view throughout the square wave discussion. The amplitude is 
measured vertically. The time for a complete cycle is measured between corresponding points on the 
wave (T0 to T2, or T1 to T3).
