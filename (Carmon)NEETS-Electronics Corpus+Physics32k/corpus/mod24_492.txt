Dispersion reduces the bandwidth, or information-carrying capacity, of an optical fiber. Dispersion
causes the spreading of the light pulse as it travels along the fiber (see figure 2-20). Fiber dispersion
mechanisms include intramodal (chromatic) dispersion and intermodal (modal) dispersion. Multimode
fiber bandwidth is a measure of the intermodal dispersion of the multimode fiber.
