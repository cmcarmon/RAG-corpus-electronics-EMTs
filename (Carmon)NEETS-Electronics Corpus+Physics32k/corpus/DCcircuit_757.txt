coils (coils 2 and 3, which drive the needle to the right, and coil 1, which drives the needle to the
left), those variations will have no effect of the calibration of the movement. In other words,
the accuracy of this ohmmeter movement is unaffected by battery voltage: a given amount
of measured resistance will produce a certain needle deï¬‚ection, no matter how much or little
battery voltage is present.
