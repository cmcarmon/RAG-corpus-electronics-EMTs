A  number  of  economic  and  technological  issues  limit  the  usefulness  of  parallel  transfer  disks.  From  the
economic perspective, providing more than one set of read/write electronics per actuator is expensive. Further,
current disks use sophisticated control systems to lock onto an individual track, and it is difﬁcult to do this
simultaneously across tracks within the same cylinder. Hence, the Cray strategy is limiting head groups to only
four surfaces. There appears to be a fundamental trade-off between track density and the number of platters:
as the track density increases, it becomes ever more difﬁcult to lock onto tracks across many platters, and the
number of surfaces that can participate in a parallel transfer is reduced. For example, current Cray track densities
are  around  980  tracks/inch,  and  require  a  rather  sophisticated  closed-loop  track-following  servo  system  to
position  the  heads  accurately  with  ﬁnely  controlled  voice  coil  actuators.  A  lower  cost  ($/megabyte)  high-
performance disk system can be constructed from several standard drives than from a single parallel transfer
device, in part because of the relatively small sales volume of parallel transfer devices compared to standard drives.
