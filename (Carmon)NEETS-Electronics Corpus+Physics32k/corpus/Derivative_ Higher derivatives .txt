Let f be a differentiable function, and let f ′(x) be its derivative. The derivative of f ′(x) (if it has one) is written f ′′(x) and is called the second derivative of f. Similarly, the derivative of a second derivative, if it exists, is written f ′′′(x) and is called the third derivative of f. Continuing this process, one can define, if it exists, the nth derivative as the derivative of the (n-1)th derivative. These repeated derivatives are called higher-order derivatives. The nth derivative is also called the derivative of order n.
If x(t) represents the position of an object at time t, then the higher-order derivatives of x have physical interpretations. The second derivative of x is the derivative of x′(t), the velocity, and by definition this is the object's acceleration. The third derivative of x is defined to be the jerk, and the fourth derivative is defined to be the jounce.
A function f need not have a derivative, for example, if it is not continuous. Similarly, even if f does have a derivative, it may not have a second derivative. For example, let




f

x
)
=


{

if

if

x

0.








{\displaystyle f(x)={\begin{cases}+x^{2},&{\text{if }}x\geq 0\\-x^{2},&{\text{if }}x\leq 0.\end{cases}}}

Calculation shows that f is a differentiable function whose derivative is

0.








{\displaystyle f'(x)={\begin{cases}+2x,&{\text{if }}x\geq 0\\-2x,&{\text{if }}x\leq 0.\end{cases}}}

f ′(x) is twice the absolute value function, and it does not have a derivative at zero. Similar examples show that a function can have k derivatives for any non-negative integer k but no (k + 1)th-order derivative. A function that has k successive derivatives is called k times differentiable. If in addition the kth derivative is continuous, then the function is said to be of differentiability class Ck. (This is a stronger condition than having k derivatives. For an example, see differentiability class.) A function that has infinitely many derivatives is called infinitely differentiable or smooth.
On the real line, every polynomial function is infinitely differentiable. By standard differentiation rules, if a polynomial of degree n is differentiated n times, then it becomes a constant function. All of its subsequent derivatives are identically zero. In particular, they exist, so polynomials are smooth functions.
The derivatives of a function f at a point x provide polynomial approximations to that function near x. For example, if f is twice differentiable, then

If f is infinitely differentiable, then this is the beginning of the Taylor series for f evaluated at x + h around x.
