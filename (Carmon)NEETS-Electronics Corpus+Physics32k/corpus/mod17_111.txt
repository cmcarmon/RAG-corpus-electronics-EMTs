Tactical communications are usually limited to a specific area of operations and are used to direct or 
report the movement of specific forces. Some tactical networks are used only for operational traffic; 
others may be used for operational and administrative traffic. For instance, the task force, task-group, and 
air-control networks are ordinarily used for operational traffic. Ship-to-shore networks and broadcast 
networks serve both types of traffic.
