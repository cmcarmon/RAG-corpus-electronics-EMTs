The LMS method is an iterative approach to echo cancellation. An example of a noniterative, block-oriented
approach is the least-squares (LS) algorithm. Solving a system of equations to get $h, however, is computationally
more  costly.  This  cost  can  be  reduced  considerably  by  running  the  LS  method  on  a  sample-by-sample  basis
and  by  taking  advantage  of  the  fact  that  the  new  signal  vectors  are  the  old  vectors  with  the  oldest  sample
dropped and one new sample added. This is the recursive least-squares (RLS) algorithm. It also has the advantage
