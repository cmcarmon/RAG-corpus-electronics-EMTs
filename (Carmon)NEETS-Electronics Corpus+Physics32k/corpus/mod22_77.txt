and magnetic tape units were also introduced. Internal processing speeds increased. Functions were 
measured in millionths of a second (microseconds). Like the first generation, a particular computer of the 
second generation was designed to process either scientific or business oriented problems but not both. 
The software was also improved. Symbolic machine languages or assembly languages were used instead 
of actual machine languages. This allowed the programmer to use mnemonic operation codes for 
instruction operations and symbolic names for storage locations or stored variables. Compiler languages 
were also developed for the second generation computers (see chapter 3).
