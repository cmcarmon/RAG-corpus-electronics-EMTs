9.1.3 The transistor switch of Figure 9.1.2(a) is to be
designed to operate in saturation and in cutoff
when the pulse signal shown in Figure P9.1.3
is applied to the input. Assume an ideal transis-
tor with β = 100, VT = 0.7 V, Vsat = 0.2 V,
and ICEO = 0.1 mA. Letting the supply voltage
VCC = 5 V and RC = 500 , determine the min-
imum value of RB, and sketch the output-voltage
waveform.
9.1.4 For the BJT switch described in Figure 9.1.2(a),
let VCC = 5 V, VT = 0.7 V, Vsat = 0.2 V, and
β = 25. If Vl switches between 0 and 5 V and
iB ≤ 0.1 mA, ﬁnd the minimum values of RB and
RC for proper operation.
