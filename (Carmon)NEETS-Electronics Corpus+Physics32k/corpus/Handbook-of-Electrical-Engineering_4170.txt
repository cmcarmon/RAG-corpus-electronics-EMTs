For large distances to the lightning channel, the radiation part of
the electric and magnetic ﬁelds is dominant due to its 1/R depen-
dence (as compared to the 1/R2 and 1/R3 dependencies of the induc-
tion and electrostatic terms, respectively). By a similar argument, for close distances, the dominant terms will
be the electrostatic term in the case of the electric ﬁeld and the induction term for the magnetic ﬁeld. It can
be readily shown from Eqs. (40.8) through (40.14) and the preceding discussion that for any individual lightning
return stroke model, the waveshapes of the vertical electric ﬁeld and the horizontal magnetic ﬁeld are almost
identical for great distances, and this fact is also evident in the experimental data (see Fig. 40.21). Moreover, it
can be shown that for great distances, the ratio of the electric ﬁeld intensity E to the magnetic ﬂux density B
is the speed of light c.
