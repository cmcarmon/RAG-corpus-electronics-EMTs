The second test is the locked (or blocked) rotor test. In this
case, a balanced three-phase voltage is applied to the stator
while the rotor is constrained so as not to turn. This test is
done at low voltage to keep the torque low and reduce the losses.
Because the voltage is low, the core ﬂux density is reduced, and
the core loss is also very low. At zero speed, the input voltage,
current, and power are measured. The stator winding losses are
subtracted as for the previous no-load test. There is no mech-
anical power and little core loss. The series reactances are much
smaller than the magnetizing reactance, and it can be assumed
the magnetizing current is negligible. Then, the impedance is
found as ZLR ¼ V1
. After subtracting the stator losses from the
measured power, the rotor resistance is found as:
