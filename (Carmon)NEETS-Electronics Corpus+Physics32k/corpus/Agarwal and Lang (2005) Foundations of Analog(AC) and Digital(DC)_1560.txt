In this problem, you will study the effect of parasitic inductances
in VLSI packages. VLSI chips are sealed inside plastic or ceramic packages and connec-
tions to certain nodes of their internal circuitry (for example, power supply, ground,
input nodes, and output nodes) need to be extended outside the package. These exten-
sions are commonly accomplished by first connecting the internal node to a metallic
‘‘pad’’ on the VLSI chip. In turn, the pad is connected to one end of a package ‘‘pin’’
using a wire that is bonded to the pad at one end and the pin at the other. The package
pin, which extends outside the package, is commonly connected to external connections
using a PC board.
