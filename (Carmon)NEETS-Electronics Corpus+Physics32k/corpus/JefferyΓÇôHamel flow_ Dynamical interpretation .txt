The equation takes the same form as an undamped nonlinear oscillator(with cubic potential) one can pretend that



θ


{\displaystyle \theta }
is time,



F


{\displaystyle F}
is displacement and




F
′



{\displaystyle F'}
is velocity of a particle with unit mass, then the equation represents the energy equation(



K

E

P

E

{\displaystyle K.E.+P.E.=0}
, where

and

) with zero total energy, then it is easy to see that the potential energy is

{\displaystyle V(F)=-{\frac {1}{3}}(a-F)(F-b)(F-c)}

where

in motion. Since the particle starts at



F
=
0


{\displaystyle F=0}
for



θ
=

{\displaystyle \theta =-\alpha }
and ends at



F
=
0


{\displaystyle F=0}
for



θ
=
α


{\displaystyle \theta =\alpha }
, there are two cases to be considered.
First case



b
,
c


{\displaystyle b,c}
are complex conjugates and



a
>
0


{\displaystyle a>0}
. The particle starts at



F
=
0


{\displaystyle F=0}
with finite positive velocity and attains



F
=
a


{\displaystyle F=a}
where its velocity is




F
′

=
0


{\displaystyle F'=0}
and acceleration is

d
F
<

{\displaystyle F''=-dV/dF<0}
and returns to



F
=
0


{\displaystyle F=0}
at final time. The particle motion



0
<
F
<
a


{\displaystyle 0<F<a}
represents pure outflow motion because



F
>
0


{\displaystyle F>0}
and also it is symmetric about



θ
=
0


{\displaystyle \theta =0}
.
Second case



c
<
b
<
0
<
a


{\displaystyle c<b<0<a}
, all constants are real. The motion from



F
=
0


{\displaystyle F=0}
to



F
=
a


{\displaystyle F=a}
to



F
=
0


{\displaystyle F=0}
represents a pure symmetric outflow as in the previous case. And the motion



F
=
0


{\displaystyle F=0}
to



F
=
b


{\displaystyle F=b}
to



F
=
0


{\displaystyle F=0}
with



F
<
0


{\displaystyle F<0}
for all time(



−
α
≤
θ
≤
α


{\displaystyle -\alpha \leq \theta \leq \alpha }
) represents a pure symmetric inflow. But also, the particle may oscillate between



b
≤
F
≤
a


{\displaystyle b\leq F\leq a}
, representing both inflow and outflow regions and the flow is no longer need to symmetric about



θ
=
0


{\displaystyle \theta =0}
.
The rich structure of this dynamical interpretation can be found in Rosenhead(1940).
