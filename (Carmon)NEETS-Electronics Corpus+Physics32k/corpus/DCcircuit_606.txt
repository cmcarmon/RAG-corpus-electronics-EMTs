• Trace current from one side of the battery to the other, following any single path (”loop”)
to the battery. Sometimes it works better to start with the loop containing the most
components, but regardless of the path taken the result will be accurate. Mark polarity
of voltage drops across each resistor as you trace the loop. Draw those components you
encounter along this loop in a vertical schematic.
