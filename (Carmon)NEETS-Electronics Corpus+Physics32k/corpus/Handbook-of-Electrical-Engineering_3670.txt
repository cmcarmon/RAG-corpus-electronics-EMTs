The amount of available energy that can be stored in a permanent magnet is the area of the largest rectangle
that can be drawn in the second quadrant of the B vs. H hysteresis loop. The energy product has grown remarkably
by a factor of about 50 since 1900 [Strnat, 1986]. We see from the graph in Fig. 36.7 of intrinsic coercive force,
i.e., the coercive force obtained from the graph of M vs. H (in contrast to the smaller coercive force obtained
by plotting B vs. H), that increases in Hc (rather than increases in Mr) have been responsible for almost all the
improvement in the energy product.
