problem QP-3 described in the previous subsections. To sum-
marize the results, each of the three algorithms, LMCS-1,
LMCS-2, and CSD, requires O(r 3) ﬂoating-point multiplica-
tive operations and O(r 2) ﬂoating-point storage units. The
numerical constant of the leading terms in the polynomial
expressions for both the run time and memory complexity is
a function of the ratio k ¼ p=r, which is the ratio of the
number of local data paths to the number of registers in a
circuit.
