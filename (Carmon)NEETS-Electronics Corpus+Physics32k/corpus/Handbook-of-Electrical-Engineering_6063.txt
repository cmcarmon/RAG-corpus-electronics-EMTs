Large  comprehensive  program  packages  are  required  by  utilities.  They  are  complex,  with  many  different
functions and must have very easy input/output (IO). They serve the needs of a single electrical system and
may be tailor-made for the customer. They can be integrated with the electrical system using SCADA (Super-
visory Control And Data Acquisition). It is not within the scope of this chapter to discuss the merits of these
programs.  SufÔ¨Åce  to  say  that  the  component  programs  used  in  these  packages  usually  have  the  same
generic/development roots as the programs used by the other three end user groups.
