Electrons in the valence shell can gain energy. If 
these electrons gain enough energy from an exter-
nal force, they can leave the atom and become free 
 electrons, moving randomly from atom to atom. 
 Materials that contain a large number of free elec-
trons are called conductors. Figure 10-5 compares 
the conductivity of various metals used as conductors.
