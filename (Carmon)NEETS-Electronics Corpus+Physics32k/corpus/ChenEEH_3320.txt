It is a well-known property of power systems that variations
in the bus voltage magnitudes mostly affect the reactive power
injections under nominal operating conditions. Similarly, the
variations in the bus voltage phase angles mostly inﬂuence the
real power injections. By idealizing this property, we assume
that all the Jacobian entries of the form
are all
identically zero. Next, if we assume that the bus voltage mag-
nitudes are all close to one pu, and the voltage phase angle
differences on the two ends of any transmission line are all
close to zero, the NR algorithm greatly simpliﬁes to the fast
decoupled algorithm stated in equation 7.58.
