Referring to Fig. 58.1, the intersection of sensory versus adaptive structures depicts the controlled structures
with a feedback architecture. That is, the active structure has an integrated controlled unit with sensors and/or
actuators that have structural as well as control functionality. Hence, the logical subset that deÔ¨Ånes an intelligent
structure is a highly integrated unit (with controlled logic, electronics, etc.) that provides the cognitive element
of a distributed or a hierarchic controlled structure.
