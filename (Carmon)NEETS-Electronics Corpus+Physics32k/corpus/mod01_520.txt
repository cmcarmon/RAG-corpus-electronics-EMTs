NOTE: The terms electromotive force and emf are used when explaining Kirchhoff’s law because
Kirchhoff’s law is used in alternating current circuits (covered in Module 2). In applying Kirchhoff’s law
to direct current circuits, the terms electromotive force and emf apply to voltage sources such as batteries
or power supplies.
