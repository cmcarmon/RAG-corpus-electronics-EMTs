Next, we will directly determine I using superposition. Superposition says that I can be
determined by summing the currents generated by each of the sources acting alone. We
will first obtain Iv, the current due to the voltage source acting alone. The subcircuit
corresponding to the voltage source acting alone is shown in Figure 3.42.
