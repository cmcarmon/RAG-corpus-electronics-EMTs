The electronics thermal control literature, as well as subsequent sections of this chapter, present much of the
relevant thermal packaging information in the form of thermal resistances. At its most fundamental level, the
thermal packaging task involves selecting a combination of heat removal mechanisms which yield an overall
thermal resistance that is not greater than the target value. The implementation of such a system will assure
that the heat source, typically a microprocessor or memory chip, will operate at an acceptable temperature.
