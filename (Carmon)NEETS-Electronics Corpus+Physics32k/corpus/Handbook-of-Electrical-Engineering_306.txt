Insofar as a load which has no magnetic or controlled source coupling to a one-port is concerned, a network
containing linear elements and both independent and controlled sources may be replaced by an ideal voltage
^
VT  is the
source of strength,
^
VOC, appearing across the terminals of the network and ZT is the driving point imped-
open-circuit voltage,
ance at the terminals of the network, obtained with all independent sources set equal to zero.
