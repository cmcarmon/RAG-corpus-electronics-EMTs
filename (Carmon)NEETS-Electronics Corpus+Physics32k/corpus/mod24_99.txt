Another interesting condition can be shown using figure 2-5. If the wave passes from a less dense to
a more dense medium, it is bent toward the normal, and the angle of refraction (r) is less than the angle of
incidence (i). Likewise, if the wave passes from a more dense to a less dense medium, it is bent away
from the normal, and the angle of refraction (r1) is greater than the angle of incidence (i1).
