The rate of change of one-dimensional integrals with sufficiently smooth integrands, is governed by this extension of the fundamental theorem of calculus:

{\displaystyle {\frac {d}{dt}}\int _{a\left(t\right)}^{b\left(t\right)}f\left(t,x\right)dx=\int _{a\left(t\right)}^{b\left(t\right)}{\frac {\partial f\left(t,x\right)}{\partial t}}dx+f\left(t,b\left(t\right)\right)b^{\prime }\left(t\right)-f\left(t,a\left(t\right)\right)a^{\prime }\left(t\right)}

The calculus of moving surfaces provides analogous formulas for volume integrals over Euclidean domains, and surface integrals over differential geometry of surfaces, curved surfaces, including integrals over curved surfaces with moving contour boundaries.
