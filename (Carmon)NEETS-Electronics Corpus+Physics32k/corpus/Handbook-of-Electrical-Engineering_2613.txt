where es is the dielectric permittivity of the semiconductor. The Debye length is a measure of how deeply a
variation of surface potential penetrates into the body when DI = 0 and the depletion layer is of zero width.
Approximating qNinv by Eq. (24.33) and QD by Eq. (24.35), Eq. (24.32) determines the surface potential at
