The RCS of an extended clutter surface is usually expressed
by a parameter called the normalized RCS, which is the RCS
per unit area. It is a dimensionless quantity and is strongly
dependent on the incident angle, the surface material, and
roughness. To Ô¨Ånd the total RCS of a ground surface illumin-
ated by a pulse, integration should be performed on all the area
elements that return to the radar at the same instant. The area
