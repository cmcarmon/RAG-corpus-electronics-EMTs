Producing a magnetic field with electricity
As Ørsted discovered, electrical current running through a wire produces a 
weak magnetic field surrounding the wire. This is why the compass needle 
moved when the compass was close to Ørsted’s circuit. Stop the current 
from flowing, and the magnetic field disappears. This temporary magnet is 
electronically controllable — that is, you can turn the magnet on and off by 
switching current on and off — and it’s known as an electromagnet.
