The reason for this is fairly easy to understand. Itâ€™s the old principle of "opposites attract." When the
control grid was made positive, electrons surrounding the cathode (negative charges) were attracted to the
grid. But remember, the grid is a metal mesh. Most of the electrons, instead of striking the grid wires,
were propelled through the holes in the mesh. Once they had passed the grid, they were attracted to the
positive charge in the plate.
