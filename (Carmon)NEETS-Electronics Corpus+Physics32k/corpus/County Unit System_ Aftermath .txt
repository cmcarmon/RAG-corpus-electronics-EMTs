Due to the court's injunction of the County Unit System in 1962, that year's Democratic gubernatorial primary was the first to be decided by popular vote since 1908. It was won by Carl Sanders of Augusta, who would go on to win unopposed in the general election in November. Sanders was the first person from an urban county (Richmond) to be elected governor since the 1920s.
Following the 1963 Gray v. Sanders decision, the Georgia Legislature had the option to redesign the County Unit System to meet the new "One Person, One Vote" standard. The legislature chose, instead, to continue electing statewide offices by popular vote, which continues to the present day. The newly elected Governor Sanders also spearheaded a massive reapportionment of Georgia's General Assembly and 10 U.S. Congressional districts, providing more proportional representation to the state's urban areas.
