Above a threshold of signal-to-noise ration of approximately 20 dB, virtually no errors occur. In all
other systems of modulation, even with signal-to-noise ratios as high as 60 dB, the noise will have some
effect. Moreover, the pcm signal can be retransmitted, as in a multiple relay link system, as many times as
desired, without the introduction of additional noise effects; that is, noise is not cumulative at relay
stations as it is with other modulation systems.
