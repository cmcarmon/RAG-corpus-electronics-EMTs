The voltage stored in a storage-element capacitor, artificial transmission line, or pulse-forming
network must be discharged through a MODULATOR SWITCHING DEVICE. The modulator switching
device conducts for the duration of the modulator pulse and is an open circuit between pulses. Thus, the
modulator switch must perform the following four functions:
