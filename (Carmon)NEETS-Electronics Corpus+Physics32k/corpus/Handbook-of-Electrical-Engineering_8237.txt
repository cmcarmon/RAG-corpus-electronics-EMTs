The analysis and design of data acquisition systems is a discipline that has roots in the following subject areas:
signal theory, transducers, analog signal processing, noise, sampling theory, quantizing and encoding theory, analog-
to-digital conversion theory, analog and digital electronics, data communication, and systems engineering. Cost,
accuracy, bit resolution, speed of operation, on-board memory, power consumption, stability of operation under
various operating conditions, number of input channels and their ranges, on-board space, supply voltage require-
ments, compatibility with existing bus interfaces, and the types of data recording instruments involved are some
of the prime factors that must be considered when designing or buying a data acquisition system. Data acquisition
systems are involved in a wide range of applications, such as machine control, robot control, medical and analytical
instrumentation, vibration analysis, spectral analysis, correlation analysis, transient analysis, digital audio and video,
seismic analysis, test equipment, machine monitoring, and environmental monitoring.
