EnviSim is a worldwide unique experimental station where it will be possible to simulate environmental conditions precisely. Thus, typical characteristics of diverse surroundings (cabin, space station, field hospital, etc.) will be generated realistically. On the one hand, analyses under uncommon and extreme conditions will be feasible, on the other hand, analyses on the human behaviour in defined and familiar environments will be far more economic, e.g. due to the abdication of flight tests. In addition, it will also be possible to modify single parameters of the surrounding explicitly so that the effect of a single factor as well as the interactions of multiple factors can be analysed regarding the impact on the human being.
EnviSim is planned to be a multi purpose area to explore diverse problems in the aerospace field. EnviSim is also planned to be a habitat making it possible for crews to live there for a longer period. For the exploration of long-term space missions a control center will be installed which simulates authentic flights and space stations. Following research topics will be part of EnviSim:
Decision behaviour and performance in a team under work loading
Modification of social structures under isolation
Team formation and efficiency
Impact of altered communicational opportunities on team work
Test of digital expert systems for performance and social conflicts
