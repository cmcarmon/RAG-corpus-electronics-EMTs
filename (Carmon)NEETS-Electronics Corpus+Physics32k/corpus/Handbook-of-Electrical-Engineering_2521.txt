In the above design example, the base current IBQ has been included in the current passing through R1. Had
this not been done, R1 would have worked out at 80 kW. Usually, this difference is not very important because
discrete (or individual) resistors are available only in a series of nominal values, and each of these is subject to
a tolerance, including 10, 5, 2, and 1%.
