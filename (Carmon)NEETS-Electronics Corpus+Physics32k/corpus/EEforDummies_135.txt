▶✓ Attach leads to the potentiometers. This step involves cutting three 
short lengths (2–3 inches each) of 22‐gauge solid wire for each poten-
tiometer, stripping both ends of each wire, and soldering the stripped 
leads to the potentiometer terminals (refer to the top row in Figure 2-6). 
See Chapter 15 for detailed instructions on soldering.
