Reasoning physically from the circuit, right after the transition the capaci-
tor is still charged to −10 volts, and the source is at +10 volts, so the voltage
across the resistor at this point is 20 volts. If it were not for the intervening
transition, the resistor voltage would decay to zero; hence Equation 16.33.
At t3, vi moves abruptly to −10 V, and forces the diode to the ON state,
