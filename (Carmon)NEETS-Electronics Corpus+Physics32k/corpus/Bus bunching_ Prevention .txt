Clumping can be prevented or reduced as follows:
Scheduling minimum and maximum amounts of time at each stop
Scheduling some crowded runs to skip certain stops
If, on a popular route with frequent service, a crowded vehicle arrives, passengers can be urged to wait for the next vehicle, which may be less crowded
A different approach is to abandon the idea of a schedule and keep buses equally spaced by strategically delaying them at designated stops. This is used to control the buses on the campus of Georgia Institute of Technology, where it outperforms the previously scheduled system.
More efficient on-board fare collection, or preferably prepaid fare collection can reduce dwell time at stops and greatly speed up service. Multiple-door, level-boarding setups can also greatly reduce stop durations, as demonstrated by the best Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) services.
Heavy ridership caused by special events (such as sporting events, large concerts, inaugurations, or holiday celebrations) is even more likely to cause problems with bunching and delays. Extra service may be added, and special rules (such as waiving of fare collection) may be used to improve service.
Merely adding more vehicles to the schedule without making other changes has been proven not to be a reliable solution to the problem of bunching.
