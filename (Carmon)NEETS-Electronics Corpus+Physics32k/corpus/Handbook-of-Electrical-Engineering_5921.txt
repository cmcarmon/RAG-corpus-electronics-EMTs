Wound ﬁeld motors are used above about 10 hp and represent the highest horsepower range of dc motor
application.  They  are  commercially  available  up  to  several  hundred  horsepower  and  are  commonly  used  in
traction, hoisting, and other applications where a wide range of speed control is needed. The shunt wound dc
motor is commonly found in industrial applications such as grinding and machine tools and in elevator and
hoist applications. Compound wound motors have both a series and shunt ﬁeld component to provide speciﬁc
torque-speed characteristics. Propulsion motors for transit vehicles are usually compound wound dc motors.
