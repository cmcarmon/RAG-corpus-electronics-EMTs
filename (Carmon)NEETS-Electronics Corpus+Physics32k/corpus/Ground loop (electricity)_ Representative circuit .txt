The circuit diagram illustrates a simple ground loop. Two circuits share a common path to ground. This path has a resistance of





R

G





{\displaystyle \scriptstyle R_{G}}
. Ideally, the ground conductor would have no resistance (





R

G



=

0



{\displaystyle \scriptstyle R_{G}\;=\;0}
), yielding no voltage drop across it,





V

G


=
0



{\displaystyle \scriptstyle V_{G}=0}
, keeping the connection point between the circuits at a constant ground potential. In that case, the output of circuit 2 is simply





V

out



=


V

2





{\displaystyle \scriptstyle V_{\text{out}}\;=\;V_{2}}
.
However, if





R

G


≠
0



{\displaystyle \scriptstyle R_{G}\neq 0}
, it and





R

1





{\displaystyle \scriptstyle R_{1}}
together form a voltage divider. As a result, if a current,





I

1





{\displaystyle \scriptstyle I_{1}}
, is flowing through





R

G





{\displaystyle \scriptstyle R_{G}}
from circuit 1, a voltage drop





V

G



=


I

R

G





{\displaystyle \scriptstyle V_{G}\;=\;I_{1}R_{G}}
, across





R

G





{\displaystyle \scriptstyle R_{G}}
occurs and the ground connection of both circuits is no longer at the actual ground potential. This voltage across the ground conductor is applied to circuit 2 and added to the output:





V

.



{\displaystyle V_{\text{out}}=V_{2}-V_{G}=V_{2}-{\frac {R_{G}}{R_{G}+R_{1}}}V_{1}.\,}

Thus the two circuits are no longer isolated from each other and circuit 1 can introduce interference into the output of circuit 2. If circuit 2 is an audio system and circuit 1 has large AC currents flowing in it, the interference may be heard as a 50 or 60 Hz hum in the speakers. Also, both circuits have voltage





V

G





{\displaystyle \scriptstyle V_{G}}
on their grounded parts that may be exposed to contact, possibly presenting a shock hazard. This is true even if circuit 2 is turned off.
Although they occur most often in the ground conductors of electrical equipment, ground loops can occur wherever two or more circuits share a common current path, if enough current is flowing to cause a significant voltage drop along the conductor.
