The rotor voltage should remain constant at all times, either 115 volts or 26 volts. In a system where 
the units are close enough to permit checking, the voltage between the R1 and R2 terminal of any unit 
energized by the primary ac source and the corresponding R1 or R2 terminal of any other unit energized 
by the primary ac source should be zero. When the excitation voltage (115 volts or 26 volts) is above or 
below the nominal value, the maximum stator voltages will also be above or below normal.
