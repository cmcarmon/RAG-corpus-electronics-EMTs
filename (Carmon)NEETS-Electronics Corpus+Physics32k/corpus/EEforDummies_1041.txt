Saving time with prestripped wires
Many of the connections between components on your breadboard are made 
by the breadboard itself, underneath the surface, but when you just can’t 
make a direct connection via the board, you use interconnect wires (some-
times called jumper wires). You use solid (not stranded) 20‐ to 22‐gauge insu-
lated wire to connect components on your breadboard. Thicker or thinner 
wire doesn’t work well in breadboard: too thick, and the wire won’t go into 
the holes; too thin, and the electrical contact will be poor.
