Sizing up solderless breadboard varieties
Solderless breadboards come in many sizes. Smaller breadboards (with 400 
to 550 holes) accommodate designs with up to three or four ICs plus a small 
handful of other discrete components. Larger boards, such as the 830‐hole 
board shown in Figures 15-1 and 15-2, provide more flexibility and accom-
modate five or more ICs. If you’re into elaborate design work, purchase extra‐
large breadboards with anywhere from 1,660 to more than 3,200 contact 
holes. These boards can handle one to three dozen ICs plus other discrete 
components.
