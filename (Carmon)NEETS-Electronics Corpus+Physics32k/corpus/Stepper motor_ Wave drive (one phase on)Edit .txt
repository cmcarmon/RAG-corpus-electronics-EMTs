In this drive method only a single phase is activated at a time. It has the same number of steps as the full-step drive, but the motor will have significantly less than rated torque. It is rarely used. The animated figure shown above is a wave drive motor. In the animation, rotor has 25 teeth and it takes 4 steps to rotate by one tooth position. So there will be 25Ã—4 = 100 steps per full rotation and each step will be 360/100 = 3.6 degrees.
