Consider a plane disk of infinite radius rotating at a constant angular velocity



Ω


{\displaystyle \Omega }
in fluid which is initially rest everywhere. The outward radial motion of the fluid near the disk due to the centrifugal force must be accompanied by an inward axial motion of the fluid towards the disk to conserve mass. Theodore von Kármán noticed that the governing equations and the boundary conditions allow a solution such that

{\displaystyle u/r,v/r}

w


{\displaystyle w}
are functions of

{\displaystyle (u,v,w)}

{\displaystyle (r,\theta ,z)}
coordinate with



r
=
0


{\displaystyle r=0}
being the axis of rotation and



z

{\displaystyle z=0}
represents the plane disk. Due to symmetry, pressure of the fluid can depend only on radial and axial coordinate



p

{\displaystyle p=p(r,z)}
. Then the continuity equation and the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations reduce to
