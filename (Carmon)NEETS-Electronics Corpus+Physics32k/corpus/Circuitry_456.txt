An  astable  multivibrator  is  shown  in  Fig.  9.15. 
This circuit produces a square wave output of 5 V 
pk-pk at approximately 690 Hz. 
 A triangle wave generator is shown in Fig. 9.16. 
This  circuit  produces  a  symmetrical  triangular 
output  waveform  at  approximately  8  Hz.  If 
desired, a simultaneous square wave output can be 
derived  from  the  output  of  IC2.  The  circuit 
requires  symmetrical  supply  voltage  rails  (not 
shown in Fig. 9.14) of between ±9V and ±15 V. 
  Figure  9.17  shows  a  single-stage  astable 
oscillator.  This  circuit  produces  a  square  wave 
output at approximately 13 Hz.  
  Finally, Fig. 9.18 shows a high-frequency crystal 
oscillator that produces an output of approximately 
1V  pk-pk  at  4  MHz.  The  precise  frequency  of 
the  quartz  crystal 
operation  depends  upon 
employed 
operate  with 
(the 
fundamental mode crystals in the range 2 MHz to 
about 12 MHz).
