In systems without error detection and correction units, the reliability of the system can be improved by providing protection through software. Protecting the entire memory (code and data) may not be practical in software, as it causes an unacceptable amount of overhead, but it is a software implemented low-cost solution for code segments.
Another elementary requirement of digital systems is the faultless transmission of data. Communication with other components can be the weak point and a source of errors of a system. A well-thought-out transmission protocol is very important. The techniques described below can also be applied to data transmitted, hence increasing transmission reliability.
