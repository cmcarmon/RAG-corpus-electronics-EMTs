Electronic  signals  are  represented  either  by  voltage  or  current.  The  time-
dependent  characteristics  of  voltage  or  current  signals  can  take  a  number  of  forms 
including  DC,  sinusoidal  (also  known  as  AC),  square  wave,  linear  ramps,  and  pulse-
width modulated signals. Sinusoidal signals are perhaps the most important signal forms 
since  once  the  circuit  response  to  sinusoidal  signals  are  known,  the  result  can  be 
generalized to predict how the circuit will respond to a much greater variety of signals 
using the mathematical tools of Fourier and Laplace transforms.
