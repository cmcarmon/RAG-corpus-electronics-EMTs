UNIJUNCTION SAWTOOTH GENERATOR.â€”So far, you have learned in this chapter that a 
switch and an RC network can generate a sawtooth waveform. When using a unijunction transistor as the 
switch, a simple sawtooth generator looks like the circuit in figure 3-44, view (A); the output waveshapes 
are shown in view (B). You may want to review unijunction transistors in NEETS, Module 7, 
Introduction to Solid-State Devices and Power Supplies, chapter 3, before continuing.
