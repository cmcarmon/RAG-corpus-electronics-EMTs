Venus has an orbit with a semimajor axis of 0.723 astronomical units (108 million kilometers), and an eccentricity of 0.007. Its small eccentricity and comparatively small size of the orbit give Venus the smallest range of aphelion and perihelion distances of the planets, 1.46 Gm. The planet orbits the Sun in 225 days and travels 4.54 AU in doing so, making the average orbital speed 35 km/s.
