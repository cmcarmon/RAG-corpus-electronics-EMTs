Consider designing a feedback system for a given nonlinear
system so that Ti ¼ 0, 1 < i < n, where Ti is the ith Volterra
kernel of the closed loop. Such a design is called partial
linearization, and it has the desirable attribute of greatly
lessening the complexity of the controller design equations.
Both the general controller design and the partial linearization
controller design, as derived using the equations above, yield
realizations with repeated structures. Collecting terms with like
coefﬁcients yields the simpliﬁed controller design. The result is
presented here for the partial linearization controller, with the
general result given by Sain (1997).
