Like the magnetic disk, the magnetic drum is another example of a direct-access storage device. 
Although the magnetic drum was once used as main (or primary) storage, it is now used as secondary (or 
auxiliary) storage. Unlike some disk packs, the magnetic drum cannot be physically removed. The drum 
is permanently mounted in the device.
