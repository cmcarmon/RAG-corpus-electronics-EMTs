9x 2 tphil  (right(x) 2 p2 ^ left(x) 2 p2) and thus (*):
Step 2: Assume (*) holds after k transitions in a state M.
Step 3: Prove (*) holds after k þ 1 transitions in a state M0
Case 1: Firing transition Pick up with a ¼ {x=ph1, y1=ch1,
y2=ch2} and from the postcondition of schema Pick up with
ch1 2 ephil0 in M0. Thus, 9x 2 ephil  (p3(x)  1) is true in
M0, and hence (*) holds in M0.
Case 2: Firing transition put down a¼ {z=< ph1, ch1, ch2 >}:
From the precondition of put down with left (ph1) ¼ ch1
and right (ph1) ¼ ch2; from the postcondition of schema put
down with ph1 2 tphil, ch1 2 chop0, and ch2 2 chop
. Thus,
9x 2 tphil  (right(x) 2 p2 ^ left(x) 2 p2) is true in M0, and
hence (*) holds in M0.
