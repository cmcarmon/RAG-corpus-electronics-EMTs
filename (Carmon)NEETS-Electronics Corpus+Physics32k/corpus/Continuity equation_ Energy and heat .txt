Conservation of energy says that energy cannot be created or destroyed. (See below for the nuances associated with general relativity.) Therefore, there is a continuity equation for energy flow:







∂
u


∂
t



+
∇
⋅

q

=
0


{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial u}{\partial t}}+\nabla \cdot \mathbf {q} =0}

where
u = local energy density (energy per unit volume),
q = energy flux (transfer of energy per unit cross-sectional area per unit time) as a vector,
An important practical example is the flow of heat. When heat flows inside a solid, the continuity equation can be combined with Fourier's law (heat flux is proportional to temperature gradient) to arrive at the heat equation. The equation of heat flow may also have source terms: Although energy cannot be created or destroyed, heat can be created from other types of energy, for example via friction or joule heating.
