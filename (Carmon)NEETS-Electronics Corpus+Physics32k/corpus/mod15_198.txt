2. Check to ensure there is zero volts between S1 and S3 and 78 volts between S2 and S3. If you 
cannot obtain these voltages, you will need to rezero the transmitter. NOTE: If you cannot use the 
78 volts from the transmitter circuit and, an auto transformer is not available, you may use a 115-
volt source. If you use 115 volts instead of 78 volts, do not energize the CT for more than 2 
minutes because it will overheat and may become permanently damaged.
