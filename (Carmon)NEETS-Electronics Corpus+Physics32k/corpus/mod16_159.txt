Inductance measurements are seldom required in the course of troubleshooting. However, inductance
measurements are useful in some cases; therefore, bridges (discussed in the next section) are available for
making this test. You will find that many capacitance test sets can be used to measure inductance. Most
capacitance test sets are furnished with inductance conversion charts if the test equipment scale is not
calibrated to read the value of inductance directly.
