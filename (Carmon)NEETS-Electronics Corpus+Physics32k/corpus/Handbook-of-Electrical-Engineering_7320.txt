An important design aspect of a PLL is the noise content of the output. The dominant resultant noise will
appear as phase noise (jitter) on the output signal from the VCO. Due to the dynamics of the PLL some of
these noise sources will be Ô¨Åltered by the loop transfer function [Eq. (76.2)] that is a low-pass characteristic.
