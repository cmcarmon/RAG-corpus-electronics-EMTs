33-kV, wye-
connected, synchronous generators operating in
parallel share equally a total load of 12 MW
at 0.8 lagging power factor. The synchronous
reactance of each machine is 8  per phase, and
the armature resistance is negligible.
(a) If one of the machines has its Ô¨Åeld excita-
tion adjusted such that it delivers 125 A lag-
ging current, determine the armature current,
power factor, excitation voltage, and power
angle of each machine.
