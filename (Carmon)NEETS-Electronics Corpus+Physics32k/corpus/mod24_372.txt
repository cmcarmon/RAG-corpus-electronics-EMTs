Fiber polishing involves a step-down approach. The first step is to give the surface of the fiber end a
rough polish. Rough-polishing occurs when the fiber, mounted to the polishing tool, moves over a 5m to
15 m grit abrasive paper. The mounted fiber moves over the abrasive paper in a figure-eight motion. The
next step involves giving the surface of the fiber end a fine polish. Fine-polishing occurs when the
mounted fiber moves over a 0.3 m to 1m grit abrasive paper in the same figure-eight motion. Fiber
inspection and cleanliness are important during each step of fiber polishing. Fiber inspection is done
visually by the use of a standard microscope at 200 to 400 times magnification.
