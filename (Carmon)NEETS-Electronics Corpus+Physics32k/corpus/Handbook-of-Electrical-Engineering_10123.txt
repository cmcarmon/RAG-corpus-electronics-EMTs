All the above conﬁgurations are serial-chain manipulators. An alternative to this common approach is the
parallel  conﬁguration,  known  as  the  Stewart  platform  [Waldron,  1990].  This  manipulator  consists  of  two
platforms  connected  by  three  prismatic  linkages.  This  arrangement  yields  the  full  six  DOF  motion  (three
position, three orientation) that can be achieved with a six-axis serial conﬁguration but has a comparably very
high stiffness. It is used as a motion simulator for pilot training and virtual reality applications. The negative
aspects of this conﬁguration are its relatively restricted motion capability and geometric complexity.
