Electrostrictors  have  also  been  integrated  into  “smart”  optical  systems  such  as  bistable  optical  devices,
interferometric  dilatometers,  and  deformable  mirrors.  Electrostrictive  correction  of  optical  aberrations  is  a
signiﬁcant  tool  in  active  optics.  Electrostrictors  also  ﬁnd  applications  in “very  smart”  systems  such  as  sen-
sor–actuator  active  vibration-suppression  elements.  A  shape  memory  effect  arising  from  inverse  hysteretic
behavior and electrostriction in PZT family antiferroelectrics is also of interest. A recent survey [Uchino, 1993]
predicts that the market share of piezoelectric and electrostrictive transducers is expected to increase to more
than $10 billion by 1998.
