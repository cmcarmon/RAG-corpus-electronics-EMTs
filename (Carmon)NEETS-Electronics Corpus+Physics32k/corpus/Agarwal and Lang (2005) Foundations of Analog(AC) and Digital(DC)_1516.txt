By isolating the capacitor from the circuit that reads the stored value, the
buffer offers added advantages. As shown in Figure 10.58, devices that read the
value stored on the capacitor might have relatively low resistances associated
with them, thereby discharging the capacitor in our original unbuffered memory
circuit. In contrast, the buffered design of the memory element circuit shown in
Figure 10.59 protects the capacitorâ€™s charge from the external circuit. By careful
design of the memory element, the input resistance of the buffer can be made
to be very large, thereby ensuring a large discharge time constant.
