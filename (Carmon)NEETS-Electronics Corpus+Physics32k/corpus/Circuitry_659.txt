Digital multi-range meters 
 
Low-cost  digital  multi-range  meters  have  been 
made possible by the advent of mass-produced LSI 
devices  and  liquid  crystal  displays.  A  3½-digit 
display  is  the  norm  and  this  consists  of  three  full 
digits that can display ‘0’ to ‘9’ and a fourth (most 
significant) digit which can only display ‘1’. Thus, 
the  maximum  display  indication,  ignoring  the 
range  switching  and  decimal  point,  is  1999; 
anything greater over-ranges the display.  
  The  resolution  of  the  instrument  is  the  lowest 
increment  that  can  be  displayed  and  this  would 
normally be an increase or decrease of one unit in 
the last (least significant) digit. The sensitivity of a 
digital  instrument  is  generally  defined  as  the 
smallest  increment  that  can  be  displayed  on  the 
lowest  (most  sensitive)  range.  Sensitivity  and 
resolution are thus not quite the same. To put this 
into context, consider the following example: 
  A digital  multi-range  meter  has  a  3½-digit 
display.  When  switched  to  the  2  V  range,  the 
maximum  indication  would  be  1.999  V  and  any 
input  of  2  V,  or  greater,  would  produce  an  over-
