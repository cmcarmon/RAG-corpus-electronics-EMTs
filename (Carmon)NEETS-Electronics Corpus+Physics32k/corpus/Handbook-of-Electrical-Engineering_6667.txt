In many packet-switched networks, the path traversed by a packet through the network is established during
a  call  set-up  procedure,  and  the  network  is  referred  to  as  a  virtual  circuit  packet  switching  network.  Other
networks provide datagram service, a service that allows users to transmit individually addressed packets without
the need for call set-up. Datagram networks have the advantage of not having to establish connections before
communication takes place, but they have the disadvantage that every packet must contain complete addressing
information. Virtual circuit networks have the advantage that addressing information is not required in each
packet, but have the disadvantage that a call set-up must take place before communication can occur. Datagram
is an example of
