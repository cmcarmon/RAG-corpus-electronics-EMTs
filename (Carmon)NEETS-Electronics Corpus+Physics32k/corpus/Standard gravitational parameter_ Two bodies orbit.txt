In the more general case where the bodies need not be a large one and a small one (the two-body problem), we define:
the vector r is the position of one body relative to the other
r, v, and in the case of an elliptic orbit, the semi-major axis a, are defined accordingly (hence r is the distance)
μ = Gm1 + Gm2 = μ1 + μ2, where m1 and m2 are the masses of the two bodies.
Then:
for circular orbits, rv2 = r3ω2 = 4π2r3/T2 = μ
for elliptic orbits, 4π2a3/T2 = μ (with a expressed in AU; T in years and M the total mass relative to that of the Sun, we get a3/T2 = M)
for parabolic trajectories, rv2 is constant and equal to 2μ
for elliptic and hyperbolic orbits, μ is twice the semi-major axis times the negative of the specific orbital energy, where the latter is defined as the total energy of the system divided by the reduced mass.
