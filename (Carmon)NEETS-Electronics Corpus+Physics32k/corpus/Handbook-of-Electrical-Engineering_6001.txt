Transform input stator abc voltages to the qd reference frame attached to the rotor using [vqd0] = [Tqd0(θ
r)][vabc] 
where θ
r(0). The currents or ﬂux linkages of the cut set of three inductors in both the q- and 
d-axis circuits of Fig. 66.35, are not independent. Using the winding ﬂux linkages per second as states, the mutual 
ﬂux linkages per second are expressed as
