The free negative electrons subsequently absorb part of the ultraviolet energy, which initially freed 
them from their atoms. As the ultraviolet light wave continues to produce positive ions and negative 
electrons, its intensity decreases because of the absorption of energy by the free electrons, and an ionized 
layer is formed. The rate at which ionization occurs depends on the density of atoms in the atmosphere 
and the intensity of the ultraviolet light wave, which varies with the activity of the sun.
