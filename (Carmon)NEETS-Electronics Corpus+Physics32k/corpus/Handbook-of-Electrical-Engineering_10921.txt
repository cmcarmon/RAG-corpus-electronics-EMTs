A  ﬁnal  important  area  for  development  of  CACSD  will  be  driven  by  the  need  to  embed  control  systems
design into information systems for enterprise integration. To some extent this is already happening with the
need for multidisciplinary teams of engineers to work on common problems. The computer-based support of
such projects requires facilities for the development and exchange of models, the storage of design data, version
control,  conﬁguration  management,  project  management,  and  computer-supported  cooperative  work.  It  is
likely that CACSD will have to develop into a much more open set of tools supported by databases, networks,
and distributed computation. The implications of some of these developments are discussed in [Barker et al.,
1993].
