Magnetographic Printing
Magnetographic printing is also similar to EP but employs magnetic powder toner and a magnetic printhead.
The magnetic head is an array of individually addressable magnetic write gaps, each representing a pixel location
on a line across the page. The head writes a magnetic “image” on a belt or drum coated with a magnetic material
such as g-Fe2O3, Co:P or Co:Cr. Toner is attracted to those areas on the drum where ﬂux reversals (and, hence,
magnetic ﬁelds external to the the magnetic media) are present. The other process steps are essentially the same
as used with EP but toner charge levels must be kept under control to ensure that electrostatic forces do not
dominate over magnetic forces.
