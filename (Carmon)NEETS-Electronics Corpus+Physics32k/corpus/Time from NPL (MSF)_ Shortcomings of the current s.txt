MSF does not broadcast any explicit advance warning of upcoming leap seconds, which occur less than once a year on average. The only indication is a change in the number of padding bits before the time code during the minute before the leap second. Therefore, unless a leap-second announcement is manually entered into a receiver in advance, it may take some time until an autonomous MSF receiver regains synchronization with UTC after a leap second (especially if the reception is not robust at the time of the leap second).
The time signal only provides 1 hour warning of summer-time changes.
