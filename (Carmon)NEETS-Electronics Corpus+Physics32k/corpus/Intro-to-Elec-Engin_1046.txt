Besides the stator and rotor iron-core losses, friction and windage losses (which are generally
functions of machine speed, and are usually assumed to be practically constant for small speed
variations) are included in no-load rotational losses, which are effectively constant. Besides
copper losses (stator and rotor winding I2R losses), stray-load losses (which arise from various
causes that are not usually accounted for, and are usually taken to be about 0.5 to 5% of the
machine output) are included for the determination of efÔ¨Åciency (= output/input).
