Most high performance digital integrated circuits implement
data processing algorithms based on the iterative execution of
basic operations. Typically, these algorithms are highly paral-
lelized and pipelined by inserting clocked registers at speciÔ¨Åc
locations throughout the circuit. The synchronization strategy
for these clocked registers in the vast majority of VLSI/ULSI-
based digital systems is a fully synchronous approach. It is
common for the computational process in these systems to
be spread over hundreds of thousands of functional
logic
elements and tens of thousands of registers.
