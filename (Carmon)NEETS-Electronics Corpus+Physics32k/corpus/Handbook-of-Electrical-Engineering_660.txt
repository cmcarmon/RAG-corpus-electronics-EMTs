Applying  the  theorems  of  the  analytic  signal  approach  [1],  assuming  a  zero-phase  channel  Ô¨Ålter  and  that
half of the bit duration is equal to an entire multiple of the RF carrier period, the low-pass equivalent model
of the RF FM-DCSK system can be developed as shown in Fig. 5.39 (for further details, see [9]).
