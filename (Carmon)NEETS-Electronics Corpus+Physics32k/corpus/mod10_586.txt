After an rf signal has been generated in a transmitter, some means must be used to radiate this signal 
through space to a receiver. The device that does this job is the antenna. The transmitter signal energy is 
sent into space by a TRANSMITTING ANTENNA; the rf signal is then picked up from space by a 
RECEIVING ANTENNA.
