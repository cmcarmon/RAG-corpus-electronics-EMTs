The TARGET RESOLUTION of a radar is its ability to distinguish between targets that are very
close together in either range or bearing. Weapons-control radar, which requires great precision, should
be able to distinguish between targets that are only yards apart. Search radar is usually less precise and
only distinguishes between targets that are hundreds of yards or even miles apart. Resolution is usually
divided into two categories; RANGE RESOLUTION and BEARING RESOLUTION.
