• Direct current (DC) is more likely to cause muscle tetanus than alternating current (AC),
making DC more likely to ”freeze” a victim in a shock scenario. However, AC is more
likely to cause a victim’s heart to ﬁbrillate, which is a more dangerous condition for the
victim after the shocking current has been halted.
