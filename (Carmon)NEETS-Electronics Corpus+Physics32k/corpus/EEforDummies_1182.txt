Testing fuses
Fuses are designed to protect electronic circuitry from damage caused by 
excessive current flow and, more importantly, to prevent a fire if a circuit 
overheats. A blown fuse is an open circuit that’s no longer providing protec-
tion, so it has to be replaced. Before you test a fuse, make sure you either 
safely remove it from the circuit or power down the circuit. Then, set your 
multimeter to the ohms setting and touch one test lead to either end of the 
fuse. If the meter reads infinite ohms, it means you have a burned‐out fuse.
