The electrodes of a SAW transducer act as sampling points for both transduction and reception. Given the
desired  modulated  time  response,  it  is  necessary  to  sample  the  time  waveform.  For  symmetrical  frequency

require sampling at twice the highest frequency of interest. A very popular approach is to sample at

The  SAW  frequency  response  obtained  is  the  convolution  of  the  desired  frequency  response  with  a  series  of
