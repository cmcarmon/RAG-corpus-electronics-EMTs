To  solve  simple  differential  equations  using  the  analog  computer
requires  cascading  three  types  of  op  amp  circuits:  integrator  circuits,
summing ampliﬁers, and inverting/noninverting ampliﬁers for negative/
positive scaling. The best way to illustrate how an analog computer solves
a differential equation is with an example.
