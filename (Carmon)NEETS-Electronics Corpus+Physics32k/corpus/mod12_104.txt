Figure 1-20 is the International Morse code used with telegraphy and cw modulation. Each character 
in the code is made up of a series of elements referred to as DOTS or DASHES. These are short (dot) and 
long (dash) bursts of signal separated by intervals of no signal. The dot is the basic time element of the 
code. The dash has three times the duration of a dot interval. The waveforms for both are shown in figure 
1-21. The elements within each character are separated by intervals of no signal with a time duration of 
one dot. The characters are separated by a no-signal interval equal in duration to one dash. Each interval
