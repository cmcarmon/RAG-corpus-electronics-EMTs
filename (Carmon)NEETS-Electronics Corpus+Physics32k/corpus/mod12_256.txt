FREQUENCY-SHIFT KEYING.â€”In its simplest form, frequency-shift keying of a transmitter
can be accomplished by shunting a capacitor (or an inductor) and key (in series) across the oscillator
circuit. By locking the normal key of the transmitter and operating only the oscillator circuit key, you can
change the oscillator frequency. The shift in frequency between mark (key-closed) and space (key-open)
conditions is determined by the effect of the additional capacitance (or inductance) on the oscillator
frequency. The frequency multiplication factor in the transmitter amplifiers must be taken into
consideration when determining the oscillator frequency shift. Thus, if the desired shift is the
conventional 850 hertz at the transmission frequency, and this frequency is four times the oscillator
frequency (that is, doubled in two stages), then the effect of the additional capacitance (or inductance) on
the oscillator must be limited to 212.5 hertz as shown below:
