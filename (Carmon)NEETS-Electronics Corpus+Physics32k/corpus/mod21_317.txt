A number of other considerations are involved in the choice of a galvanometer. For example, the 
galvanometer should not be subjected to false or erratic indications because of external magnetic fields. 
This requirement dictates the choice of a shielded meter mechanism. It is also desirable to use a critically 
dampened meter movement to ensure decisive movement of the meter pointer during conditions of bridge 
unbalance. Thermal agitation sometimes produces voltages that interfere with the balancing of the bridge. 
For this reason, the Wheatstone bridge usually includes a polarity-reversing switch in the detector circuit. 
When a measurement is required, note the reading for both positive and negative indications, and figure 
the average of both readings. With the exception of inaccuracies introduced by thermal variations (caused 
by excessive supply voltages), the accuracy of the Wheatstone bridge is, otherwise, independent of the 
value of supply voltages. The units used in calibrating the galvanometer are unimportant to the accuracy 
of the bridge, since a 0 indication is desired at the balanced condition.
