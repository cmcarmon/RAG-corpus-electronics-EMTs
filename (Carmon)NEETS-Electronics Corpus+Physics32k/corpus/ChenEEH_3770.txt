16 In addition to the two most prominent training methods described here,
gradient search techniques (Levinson et al., 1983) and techniques based on the
concept of statistical discrimination (Ephraim et al., 1989; Bahl et al., 1988),
have been used for training. The latter works includes algorithms for corrective
training which reinforce model parameters when they achieve successful detec-
tion and ‘‘negatively train’’ models with data that cause false recognition.
