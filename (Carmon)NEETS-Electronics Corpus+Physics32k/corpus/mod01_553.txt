The problem of a desire for both high efficiency and maximum power transfer is resolved by a
compromise between maximum power transfer and high efficiency. Where the amounts of power
involved are large and the efficiency is important, the load resistance is made large relative to the source
resistance so that the losses are kept small. In this case, the efficiency is high. Where the problem of
matching a source to a load is important, as in communications circuits, a strong signal may be more
important than a high percentage of efficiency. In such cases, the efficiency of power transfer should be
only about 50 percent; however, the power transfer would be the maximum which the source is capable of
supplying.
