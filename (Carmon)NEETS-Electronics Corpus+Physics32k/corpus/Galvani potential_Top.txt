Galvani potential (also called Galvani potential difference, or inner potential difference, Δφ, delta phi) in electrochemistry, is the electric potential difference between two points in the bulk of two phases. These phases can be two different solids (e.g., two metals joined together), or a solid and a liquid (e.g., a metal electrode submerged in an electrolyte).
Generally, the Galvani potential difference is measurable only when the two phases have identical chemical composition.
The Galvani potential is named after Luigi Galvani.
