Notice that the orbits of the electrons in the dielectric material are distorted by the electrostatic field.
The distortion occurs because the electrons in the dielectric are attracted to the top plate while being repelled
from the bottom plate. When switch S1 is opened, the battery is removed from the circuit and the charge is
retained by the capacitor. This occurs because the dielectric material is an insulator, and the electrons in the
bottom plate (negative charge) have no path to reach the top plate (positive charge). The distorted orbits of
the atoms of the dielectric plus the electrostatic force of attraction between the two plates hold the positive
and negative charges in their original position. Thus, the energy which came from the battery is now stored
in the electrostatic field of the capacitor. Two slightly different symbols for representing a capacitor are
shown in figure 3-5. Notice that each symbol is composed of two plates separated by a space that represents
the dielectric. The curved plate in  (B) of the figure indicates the plate should be connected to a negative
polarity.
