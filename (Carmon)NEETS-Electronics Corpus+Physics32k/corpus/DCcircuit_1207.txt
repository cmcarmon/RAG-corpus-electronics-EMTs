Algebraically solving for A, we get a value of 116,035 circular mils. Referencing our solid
wire size table, we ﬁnd that ”double-ought” (2/0) wire with 133,100 cmils is adequate, whereas
the next lower size, ”single-ought” (1/0), at 105,500 cmils is too small. Bear in mind that our
circuit current is a modest 25 amps. According to our ampacity table for copper wire in free air,
14 gauge wire would have sufﬁced (as far as not starting a ﬁre is concerned). However, from
the standpoint of voltage drop, 14 gauge wire would have been very unacceptable.
