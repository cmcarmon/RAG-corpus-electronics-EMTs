Figure 2.24 also shows the conﬂict graph and the optimal
memory organization for three points on the cavity detector’s
Pareto curve. With lowering cycle budgets, more and more
parallelism is required to meet the constraint. This is reﬂected
by the additional conﬂicts in the conﬂict graph. The memory
architecture needs more and more ports to provide the re-
quired parallelism and thus becomes more and more power-
hungry. These results clearly substantiate the importance and
the powerful exploration capability of the applied method-
ology and tools.
