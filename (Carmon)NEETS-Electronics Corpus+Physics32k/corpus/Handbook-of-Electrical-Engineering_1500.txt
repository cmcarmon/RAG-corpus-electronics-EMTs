Suppose  now  that  the  state  sequence  q  is  a  sequence  of  speech  sounds  and  cannot  be  observed  directly.
Instead, observation Ot is produced with the system in some unobserved state qt (where qt ˛
 {S1, S2, …, SN}).
Assume that the production of Ot in each possible Si, i = 1, 2, …, N is stochastic and is characterized by a set
of observation probability measures B = {bi(Ot)N
