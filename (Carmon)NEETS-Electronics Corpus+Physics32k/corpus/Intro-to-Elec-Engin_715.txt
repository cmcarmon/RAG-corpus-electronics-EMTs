7.4.20 Consider the MOSFET connected as a two-
terminal device, as shown in Figure P7.4.20. Dis-
cuss its states of operation.
7.4.21 Find the parameter values VT and IDSS for a p-
channel MOSFET with iD = 0 when vGS ≤ −3
V, and iD = 5 mA when vGS = vDS = −8 V. You
may neglect the effect of vDS on iD.
7.4.22 In a depletion MOSFET for which VP = 3 V and
IDSS = 11 mA, the drain current is 3 mA when vDS
is set at the largest value that will maintain ohmic-
region operation. Find vGS if VA is very large.
