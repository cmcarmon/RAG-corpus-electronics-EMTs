where D = C/K is the parameter value of a new component produced by the transformation, which is usually
referred  to  as  a  frequency-dependent  negative  resistance  (FDNR).  This  name  results  from  the  fact  that  the
sinusoidal steady-state impedance ZT(jw) = â€“(1/w2D) is frequency-dependent, negative, and real, hence, resis-
tive. In practice, the FDNR elements are realized by RC-active subnetworks using op amps, normally two per
FDNR. Figure 29.11(a) and (b) shows the sequence of circuit changes involved in transforming from a third-
order LCR prototype ladder to an FDNR circuit. Figure 29.11(c) gives an RC-active realization for the FDNR
based on the use of a GIC, introduced in the previous subsection.
