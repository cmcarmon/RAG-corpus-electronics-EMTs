Object-oriented programming embraces a novel abstraction that seems to Ô¨Åt the world of computing: objects.
In this paradigm, the world is modeled as a collection of objects that communicate by sending messages to one
another. The objects are related to each other through an inheritance mechanism that passes on the algorithmic
behavior from one class of objects to another class. Inheritance permits reuse and thus raises the programming
abstraction to a level above previous paradigms.
