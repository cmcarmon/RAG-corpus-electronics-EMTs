ELECTRODE RESISTANCE MEASUREMENTS.â€”Connect the in-circuit probe test leads to
the transistor with the yellow lead to the emitter, the green lead to the base, and the blue lead to the
collector. Set the FUNCTION switch to the OHMS E-B position, and read the resistance between the
emitter and base electrode on the center scale of the meter.
