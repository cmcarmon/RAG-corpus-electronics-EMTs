Any classical system of two particles is, by definition, a two-body problem. In many cases, however, one particle is significantly heavier than the other, e.g., the Earth and the Sun. In such cases, the heavier particle is approximately the center of mass, and the reduced mass is approximately the lighter mass. Hence, the heavier mass may be treated roughly as a fixed center of force, and the motion of the lighter mass may be solved for directly by one-body methods.
In other cases, however, the masses of the two bodies are roughly equal, so that neither of them can be approximated as being at rest. Astronomical examples include:
a binary star, e.g. Alpha Centauri (approx. the same mass)
a double planet, e.g. Pluto with its moon Charon (mass ratio 0.147)
a binary asteroid, e.g. 90 Antiope (approx. the same mass)
