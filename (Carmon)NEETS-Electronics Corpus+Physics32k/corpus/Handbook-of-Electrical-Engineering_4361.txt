In Eq. 42.32, n† is the second derivative of the refractive index with respect to l, M = ( l/c)n† is the material
dispersion, and Dl  is the linewidth of the pulse. Figure 42.12 shows the wavelength dependence of material
dispersion [Wemple, 1979]. Note that for silica, zero dispersion occurs around 1.3 mm, and material dispersion
is small in the wavelength range of small ﬁber attenuation.
