Automatic Focusing
We mentioned in the preceding section that since the objective has a large numerical aperture (NA ‡ 0.5), its
depth of focus d is rather shallow (d . –1 mm at l = 780 nm). During all read/write/erase operations, therefore,
the  disk  must  remain  within  a  fraction  of  a  micrometer  from  the  focal  plane  of  the  objective.  In  practice,
however,  the  disks  are  not  ﬂat  and  they  are  not  always  mounted  rigidly  parallel  to  the  focal  plane,  so  that
movements away from focus occur a few times during each revolution. The peak-to-peak movement in and
out of focus may be as much as 100 mm. Without automatic focusing of the objective along the optical axis,
this  runout  (or  disk  ﬂutter)  will  be  detrimental  to  the  operation  of  the  system.  In  practice,  the  objective  is
mounted  on  a  small  motor  (usually  a  voice  coil)  and  allowed  to  move  back  and  forth  in  order  to  keep  its
distance within an acceptable range from the disk. The spindle turns at a few thousand rpm, which is a hundred
or so revolutions per second. If the disk moves in and out of focus a few times during each revolution, then
the voice coil must be fast enough to follow these movements in real time; in other words, its frequency response
must extend to several kilohertz.
