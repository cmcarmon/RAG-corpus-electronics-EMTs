An example of a bioanalytical sensor is a glucose sensor. The ﬁrst portion of the sensor contains the enzyme
glucose oxidase. This enzyme promotes the oxidation of glucose to glucuronic acid and consumes oxygen in
the process. Thus, by placing an oxygen sensor along with the glucose oxidase in the bioanalytical sensor, one
can determine the amount of glucose oxidized by measuring the amount of oxygen consumed. An even better
approach is to have two identical sensor structures in the same package. The only difference is that only one
of  the  sensors  contains  the  enzyme.  When  there  is  no  glucose  present,  both  sensors  will  measure  the  same
oxygen  partial  pressure.  The  presence  of  glucose,  however,  will  cause  the  sensor  with  the  glucose  oxidase  to
have  a  reduced  partial  pressure  of  oxygen  due  to  the  oxygen  consumption  of  the  reaction.  By  making  a
differential measurement of oxygen partial pressure with both sensors, other factors that can cause an apparent
change in oxygen partial pressure such as temperature will have a much lower effect than if a single sensor was used.
Stability  problems  are  important  for  bioanalytical  sensors,  especially  those  that  are  used  for  long-term
measurements. Not only are the stability issues the same as for the physical and chemical sensors, but they are
also related to preservation of the biological molecules used in the ﬁrst stage of the sensor. These molecules
can often be degraded or destroyed by heat or exposure to light. Even aging can degrade some of these molecules.
Thus, an important issue in dealing with bioanalytical sensors is the preservation of the biochemical components
of the sensor. Not all biochemical reactions are entirely reversible, and so the bioanalytical sensors based on
them will not be reversible as well. This may be acceptable for some applications but not for others and must
be taken into consideration in choosing a bioanalytical sensor.
