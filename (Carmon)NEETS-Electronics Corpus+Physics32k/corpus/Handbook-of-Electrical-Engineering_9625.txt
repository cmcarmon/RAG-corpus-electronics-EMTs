No  matter  how  fast  computers  become,  it  seems  they  are  never  fast  enough.  Manufacturers  make  faster
computers by decreasing the amount of time it takes to do each operation. An alternative is to build a computer
that performs several operations simultaneously. A parallel computer, also called a multiprocessor, is one that
contains more than one CPU.
