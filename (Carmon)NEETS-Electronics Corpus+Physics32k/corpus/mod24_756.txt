The high-impedance preamplifier is generally used with a large load resistor to improve sensitivity.
The large load resistor is used to reduce thermal noise. Although the high-impedance preamplifier
achieves high sensitivity, receiver bandwidth and dynamic range are limited. The transimpedance
preamplifier uses a low-noise, high-input impedance amplifier with negative feedback. This design
provides improvements in bandwidth and dynamic range with some degradation in sensitivity from an
increase in noise. For more information on receiver performance and design, refer to the reference
material listed in appendix 2.
