In basic circuit theory we neglect the effects of the ﬁnite time of transit of changes in current and
voltage and the ﬁnite distances over which these changes occur. We assume that changes occur
simultaneously at all points in the circuits. But there are situations in which we must consider the
ﬁnite time it takes for an electrical or magnetic wave to travel and the distance it will travel. It is
in these situations that one must employ traveling-wave theory. Traveling-wave concepts must
be used whenever the distance is so great or the frequency so high that it takes an appreciable
portion of a cycle for the wave to travel the distance.
