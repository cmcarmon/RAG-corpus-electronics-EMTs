The player himself/herself does not go through the movement of striking; percussion results indirectly through some other movement by the player.
112.1 Shaken Idiophones or rattles – The player makes a shaking motion
112.11 Suspension rattles – Perforated idiophones are mounted together, and shaken to strike against each other.
112.111 Strung rattles – Rattling objects are strung in rows on a cord.
112.112 Stick rattles – Rattling objects are strung on a bar or ring.

112.12 Frame rattles – Rattling objects are attached to a carrier against which they strike (flexatone).
112.121 Pendant rattles.

112.13 Vessel rattles – Rattling objects enclosed in a vessel strike against each other or against the walls of the vessel, or usually against both.

112.2 Scraped Idiophones – The player causes a scraping movement directly or indirectly; a non-sonorous object moves along the notched surface of a sonorous object, to be alternately lifted off the teeth and flicked against them; or an elastic sonorous object moves along the surface of a notched non-sonorous object to cause a series of impacts. This group must not be confused with that of friction idiophones.
