The Iridium satellites operate at LEO (altitude = 780 km) with time-division duplex (TDD), using the same
1.6-GHz L-band frequencies for transmission and reception but only receiving or transmitting for somewhat
less  than  half  the  time  each.  Iridium  uses  66  LEO  satellites  for  personal  communications  systems  (PCS)  to
enable communications directly to and from small handheld portable telephones at any time and anywhere in
the world. Other PCS satellite systems will operate at 1.6 GHz for the uplink and 2.5 GHz for the downlink
(e.g., FCC Ô¨Ålings for Globalstar and Odyssey).
