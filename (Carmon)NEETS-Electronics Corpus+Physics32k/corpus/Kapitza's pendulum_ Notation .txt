Denote the vertical axis as



y


{\displaystyle y}
and the horizontal axis as



x


{\displaystyle x}
so that the motion of pendulum happens in the (



x


{\displaystyle x}
-



y


{\displaystyle y}
) plane. The following notation will be used




ν


{\displaystyle \nu }
—frequency of the vertical oscillations of the suspension,




a


{\displaystyle a}
— amplitude of the oscillations of the suspension,





ω

0

g

/

l




{\displaystyle \omega _{0}={\sqrt {g/l}}}
— proper frequency of the mathematical pendulum,




g


{\displaystyle g}
— free fall acceleration,




l


{\displaystyle l}
— length of rigid and light pendulum,




m


{\displaystyle m}
— mass.
Denoting the angle between pendulum and downward direction as



φ


{\displaystyle \varphi }
the time dependence of the position of pendulum gets written as
