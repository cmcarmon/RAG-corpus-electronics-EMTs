where a is the common base current gain of the transistor
(a ¼ IC=IE). From equation 7.11, the anode current becomes
arbitrarily large as (a1 þ a2) approaches unity. As the anode–
cathode voltage increases, the depletion region expands and
reduces the neutral base width of the n1 and p2 regions. This
causes a corresponding increase in the a of the two transistors.
If a positive gate current of sufﬁcient magnitude is applied to
