C-K theory was a response to three perceived limitations of existing design theories:
Design theory when assimilated to problem solving theory is unable to account for innovative aspects of design.
Classic design theories dependent on object domains, machine design, architecture or industrial design favored design theories that were tailored to their specific knowledge bases and contexts. Without a unified design theory these fields experience difficulties over cooperation in real design situations.
Design theories and creativity theories have been developed as separate fields of research. But design theory should include the creative, surprising and serendipitous aspects of design; while creativity theories have been unable to account for intentional inventive processes common in design fields.
C-K theory claims to have overcome these three limitations. It uses an approach which is domain-independent and which allows acting on unknown objects, and changes of the definitions of known objects during the process (revision of objects' identities). C-K theory was shown by Hatchuel and Weil to be closely related to Braha's Formal Design Theory  and its clarification by Braha and Reichâ€™s Coupled Design Theory, which are both based on topological structures for design modeling.
