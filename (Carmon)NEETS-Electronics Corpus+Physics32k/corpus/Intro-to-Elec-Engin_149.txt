1.4.7 Three waveforms seen on an oscilloscope are
shown in Figure P1.4.7. If the horizontal scale
is set to 50 ms per division (500 ms for the en-
tire screen width), and the vertical scale is set
to 5 mV per division (Â±25 mV for the entire
screen height with zero voltage at the center),
determine: (i) the maximum value of the volt-
age, and (ii) the frequency for each of the wave-
forms.
