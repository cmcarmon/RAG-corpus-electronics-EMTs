Problem 2.5:
Express each of the indicated voltages as the real part of a complex exponential: v (t) = Re [V est]. Explicitly
indicate the value of the complex amplitude V and the complex frequency s. Represent each complex
amplitude as a vector in the V -plane, and indicate the location of the frequencies in the complex s-plane.
