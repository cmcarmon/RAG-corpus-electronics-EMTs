Coherent detection: The signal beam is mixed with a locally generated laser beam at the receiver. This results
in improved receiver sensitivity and in improved receiver discrimination between closely spaced carriers.
Material dispersion: Wavelength dependence of the pulse velocity. It is caused by the refractive index variation
