Notice that the source voltage v is divided among the resistors in direct
proportion  to  their  resistances;  the  larger  the  resistance,  the  larger  the
voltage  drop.  This  is  called  the  principle  of  voltage  division,  and  the
circuit in Fig. 2.29 is called a voltage divider. In general, if a voltage
divider has N resistors 
in series with the source volt-
age v, the nth resistor (
