The key reason why digital signal processing systems have a technological advantage today is the com-
puter: computations, like the Fourier transform, can be performed quickly enough to be calculated as the
signal is produced,2 and programmability means that the signal processing system can be easily changed.
This ﬂexibility has obvious appeal, and has been widely accepted in the marketplace. Programmability
means that we can perform signal processing operations impossible with analog systems (circuits). We will
also discover that digital systems enjoy an algorithmic advantage that contributes to rapid processing
speeds: Computations can be restructured in non-obvious ways to speed the processing. This ﬂexibility
comes at a price, a consequence of how computers work. How do computers perform signal processing?
5.2 Introduction to Computer Organization3
5.2.1 Computer Architecture
To understand digital signal processing systems, we must understand a little about how computers compute.
The modern deﬁnition of a computer is an electronic device that performs calculations on data, presenting
the results to humans or other computers in a variety of (hopefully useful) ways.
