The identical circuit can also be used to recover a carrier for
a GMSK system. (de Buda, 1972; Murota and Hirade, 1981;
Pasupathy, 1979). The next step is to recover data time or bit
synchronization. Most communication systems transmit a se-
quence of zeros and ones in an alternating pattern to enable
the receiver to maintain bit synchronization. A PLL operating
at the bit timing is used to maintain timing. Once the PLL is
synchronized on the received 101010 . . . pattern (Figure 4.17),
it will remain synchronized on any other patterns except for
long sequences of all zeros or all ones.
