As mentioned, the basic unit of power is the watt. A 
watt is equal to the voltage across a circuit  multiplied 
by the current through the circuit. It represents the 
rate at any given instant in which work is being done, 
 moving electrons through the circuit. The relation-
ship of power, current, and voltage may be expressed 
as follows:
