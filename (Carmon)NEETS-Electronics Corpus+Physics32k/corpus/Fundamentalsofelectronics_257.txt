Here, the output voltage equals an ampliﬁed version of the diﬀerence of node voltages appearing across
its inputs. The dependent source model portrays how the op-amp works quite well. As in most active circuit
schematics, the power supply is not shown, but must be present for the circuit model to be accurate. Most
operational ampliﬁers require both positive and negative supply voltages for proper operation.
