Observe how a trapezoidal generator differs from a sawtooth generator. If the output were taken 
across the capacitor alone, the output voltage would be 0 at the first instant. But splitting the R of the RC 
network so that the output is taken across the capacitor and part of the total resistance produces the jump 
voltage.
