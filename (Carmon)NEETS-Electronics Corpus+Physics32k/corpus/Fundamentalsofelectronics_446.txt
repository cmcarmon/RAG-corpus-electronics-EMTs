For some consonants, the vocal cords vibrate just as in vowels. For example, the so-called nasal sounds
“n” and “m” have this property. For others, the vocal cords do not produce a periodic output. Going back to
mechanism, when consonants such as “f” are produced, the vocal cords are placed under much less tension,
which results in turbulent ﬂow. The resulting output airﬂow is quite erratic, so much so that we describe it
as being noise. We deﬁne noise carefully later when we delve into communication problems.
