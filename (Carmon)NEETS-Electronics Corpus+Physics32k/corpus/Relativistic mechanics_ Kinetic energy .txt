The work-energy theorem says the change in kinetic energy is equal to the work done on the body. In special relativity:

.






{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\Delta K=W=[\gamma _{1}-\gamma _{0}]m_{0}c^{2}.\end{aligned}}}


If in the initial state the body was at rest, so v0 = 0 and γ0(v0) = 1, and in the final state it has speed v1 = v, setting γ1(v1) = γ(v), the kinetic energy is then;




K

{\displaystyle K=[\gamma (v)-1]m_{0}c^{2}\,,}

a result that can be directly obtained by subtracting the rest energy m0c2 from the total relativistic energy γ(v)m0c2.
