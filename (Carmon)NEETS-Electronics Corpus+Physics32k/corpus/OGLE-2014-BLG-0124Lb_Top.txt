OGLE-2014-BLG-0124Lb is one of the farthest planets that we know of today. It is approximately 13,000 light years away, located near the center of the galaxy. The planet was discovered using a technique called microlensing. In this case it took 150 days. Two telescopes are used to detect the planet and the time difference between identification by each telescope is used to calculate the distance to the planet. This also contributes to determining the mass of the planet which is about half of Jupiter's. The planet orbits a star with a mass of 0.7 solar masses and is 3.1 AUs from it.
