Thin-ﬁlm recording media generally have excellent magnetic properties for high-density recording. Because
they are nearly 100% dense (voids at the grain boundaries reduce the density somewhat), they can be made to
have the highest possible magnetization. Because of their high magnetization, they can be made extremely thin
and  still  provide  adequate  signal  during  readback.  This  helps  narrow  the  recorded  transition  since  the  head
ﬁeld gradient is sharper for thinner media, as was discussed in reference to Fig. 36.10.
