Actual cubic foot per minute (ACFM) is the volume of gas flowing anywhere in a system, independent of its temperature and pressure. If the system were moving a gas at exactly the "standard" condition, then ACFM would equal SCFM. Unfortunately, this usually is not the case as the most important change between these two definitions is the pressure. To move a gas, a positive pressure or a vacuum must be created. When positive pressure is applied to a standard cubic foot of gas, it is compressed. When a vacuum is applied to a standard cubic foot of gas, it expands. The volume of gas after it is pressurized or rarefied is referred to as its "actual" volume.
SCF and ACF for an ideal gas are related in accordance with the combined gas law:

{\displaystyle {\frac {P_{1}V_{1}}{T_{1}}}={\frac {P_{2}V_{2}}{T_{2}}}}

Defining standard conditions by the subscript 1 and actual conditions by the subscript 2, then:

{\displaystyle {\rm {SCF}}={\rm {ACF}}\,\cdot \,\left({\frac {P_{\rm {actual}}}{P_{\rm {standard}}}}\right)\,\left({\frac {T_{\rm {standard}}}{T_{\rm {actual}}}}\right)}

where



P


{\displaystyle P}
is in absolute pressure units and



T


{\displaystyle T}
is in absolute temperature units (i.e., either kelvins or degrees Rankine).
This is only valid when at a pressure and temperature close to standard conditions. For non-ideal gasses (most gasses) a compressibility factor "Z" is introduced to allow for non-ideality. To introduce the compressibility factor to the equation divide ACF by "Z".
