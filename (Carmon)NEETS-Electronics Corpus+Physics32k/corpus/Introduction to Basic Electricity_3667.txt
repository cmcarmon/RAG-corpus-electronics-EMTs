the capacitor filter is added to the output of the  rectifier, 
the  capacitor does not discharge very far before the 
next pulse  occurs. The output voltage is high. If a large 
 capacitor is used, the output equals the peak voltage of 
the input signal. Thus, the capacitor does a better job of 
filtering in a  full-wave circuit than in a half-wave circuit.
The purpose of the filter capacitor is to smooth out 
the pulsating DC voltage from the rectifier. The ripple 
remaining on the DC voltage determines the filterâ€™s 
performance. The ripple can be made lower by using 
a large capacitor or by increasing the load resistance. 
Typically, the load resistance is determined by the cir-
cuit design. Therefore, the size of the filter capacitor is 
determined by the amount of the ripple.
