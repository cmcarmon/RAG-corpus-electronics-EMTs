Suppose, now, that a rectangular pulse of height VS is applied at the Store input of the
memory element, and that A is at 0 V throughout. The rising transition of the pulse
occurs at t = 0 and the falling transition at t = T. Determine the minimum value of
the pulse width T so that vM can charge up to VH, where VH = VIH = VOH, the
high voltage threshold of the static discipline. Assume the following: vM(t = 0) = 0;
VH < VS; VH > VT.
Let us now consider the case in which A is at VS throughout, and vM(t = 0) = VS.
Sketch vM(t) for t â‰¥ 0, when a 0-V to VS-step is applied at the Store input of the
memory element at t = 0. What is the minimum value attained by vM?
Suppose, now, that a rectangular pulse of height VS is applied at the Store input
of the memory element. The rising transition of the pulse occurs at t = 0 and the
falling transition at t = T. Determine the minimum value of the pulse width T so
that vM can discharge from VS to VL, where VL = VIL = VOL, the low voltage
threshold of the static discipline. Assume as in (c) that A is at VS throughout and
that vM(t = 0) = VS. Assume further that VL < VT and that VL is greater than the
minimum value attainable by vM.
Suppose the memory element is storing a 1 (assume vM = VS) at t = 0 and that
Store = 0. Assuming that no further Store signals occur, determine the period of
time for which the output (dOUT) of the memory element will be valid. (Hint: the
output becomes invalid when dOUT switches from 1 to 0.)
