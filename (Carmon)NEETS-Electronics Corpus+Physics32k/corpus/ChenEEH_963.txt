The clock skew scheduling methodology discussed in Sections
4.3 and 4.4 is based on the assumption that complete connec-
tivity and timing information is available for all local data
paths in a circuit. This condition may, however, not be realis-
tic. Consider, for example, the input and output registers (also
called the I/O registers) in a VLSI system. Some I/O registers
are illustrated in Figure 4.13, where the registers R1 and R5 are
an input register and an output register, respectively, of the
circuit C. The register R3 shown in Figure 4.13 is an internal
register because all of the other registers to which R3 is con-
nected (via local data paths) are inside the circuit C.
