A PARALLEL-NEGATIVE LIMITER is shown in view (A) of figure 4-12. Notice the similarity of 
the parallel-negative limiter and the parallel-positive limiter shown in view (A) of figure 4-9. From T0 to 
T1 of the input signal, the diode is reverse biased and does not conduct, as shown in view (B) of figure 
4-12. The output signal follows the input signal and the positive alternation is not limited.
