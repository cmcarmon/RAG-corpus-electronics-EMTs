Modulation is the process whereby the amplitude (or another characteristic) of a wave is varied
as a function of the instantaneous value of another wave. The Ô¨Årst wave, which is usually a
single-frequency wave, is called the carrier wave; the second is called the modulating wave.
Demodulation or detection is the process whereby a wave resulting from modulation is so operated
upon that a wave is obtained having substantially the characteristics of the original modulating
wave. Modulation and demodulation are then reverse processes.
