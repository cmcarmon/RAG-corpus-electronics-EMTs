Other applications require a reader that will participate in a secure information exchange transaction between
participants. Thus, desktop systems are smaller and have their use in business application to provide secured
services. Along with security modules, some readers will accept several cards to authenticate, for instance, the
owner and the receiver of a conﬁdential information. In healthcare application, the patient will authorize access
to  his  ﬁles  while  the  doctor  will  provide  the  proof  that  he  has  the  right  to  access  this  kind  of  information.
Several  security  modules  will  ensure  security  and  protection  for  different  applications  executed  through  the
same  reader,  treated  separately  one  from  another.  Other  suitable  applications  for  those  readers  are  payment
transactions, electronic purses, and loyalty programs. The integration of the keyboard and the display to the
security  of  the  process  ensures  that  the  user’s  PIN  and  exchanged  information  are  not  tapped  by  another
software.
