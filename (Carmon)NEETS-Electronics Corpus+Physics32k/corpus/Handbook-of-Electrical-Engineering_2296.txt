The  foregoing  method  is  an  approximation;  however,  it  is  quite  practical  for  ﬁrst-hand  calculations.  To
compare this with the above iterative approach let us assume m = 1, VD0 = 0.60 V, rD = 12 W, VCC = 5 V, R =
1 kW. The current ID1 = [VCC – VD0]/(R + rD) = 4.34 mA compared with ID1 = 4.25 mA in the iterative approach.
