A simple, one-transistor REGENERATIVE DETECTOR circuit that uses the heterodyning principle
for cw operation is shown in figure 3-4. The circuit can be made to oscillate by increasing the amount of
energy fed back to the tank circuit from the collector-output circuit (by physically moving tickler coil L2
closer to L1 using the regeneration control). This feedback overcomes losses in the base-input circuit and
causes self-oscillations which are controlled by tuning capacitor C1. The received signal from the antenna
and the oscillating frequency are both present at the base of transistor Q1. These two frequencies are
heterodyned by the nonlinearity of the transistor. The resulting beat frequencies are then rectified by the
emitter-base junction and produce a beat note which is amplified in the collector-output circuit. The af
currents in the collector circuit actuate the phones. The REGENERATIVE DETECTOR (figure 3-4)
produces its own oscillations, heterodynes them with an incoming signal, and rectifies or detects them.
