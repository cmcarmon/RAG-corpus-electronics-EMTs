Gauge vector–tensor gravity (GVT) is a relativistic generalization of Mordehai Milgrom's modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) paradigm where gauge fields cause the MOND behavior. The former covariant realizations of MOND such as the Bekenestein's tensor–vector–scalar gravity and the Moffat's scalar–tensor–vector gravity attribute MONDian behavior to some scalar fields. GVT is the first example wherein the MONDian behavior is mapped to the gauge vector fields. The main features of GVT can be summarized as follows:
As it is derived from the action principle, GVT respects conservation laws;
In the weak-field approximation of the spherically symmetric, static solution, GVT reproduces the MOND acceleration formula;
It can accommodate gravitational lensing.
It is in total agreement with the Einstein–Hilbert action in the strong and Newtonian gravities.
Its dynamical degrees of freedom are:
