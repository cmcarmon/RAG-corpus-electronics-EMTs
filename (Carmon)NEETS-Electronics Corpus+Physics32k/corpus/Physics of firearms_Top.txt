From the viewpoint of physics (dynamics, to be exact), a firearm, as for most weapons, is a system for delivering maximum destructive energy to the target with minimum delivery of energy on the shooter. The momentum delivered to the target, however, cannot be any more than that (due to recoil) on the shooter. This is because the momentum imparted to the bullet is equal to that imparted to the gun-shooter system.
