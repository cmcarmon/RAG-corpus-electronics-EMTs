has a 1s complement instruction. The 6800 and the 
Z80 have both 1s and 2s complement. Complementing 
provides a method of representing signed numbers. 
Complementing numbers allow the ALU to perform 
subtract operations using an adder circuit. Therefore, 
the MPU can use the same circuits for addition and 
subtraction.
