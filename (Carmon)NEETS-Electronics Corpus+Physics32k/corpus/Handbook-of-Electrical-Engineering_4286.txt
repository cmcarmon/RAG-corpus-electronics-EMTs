The  beat  frequency  is  constant  except  near  the  turn-around  region  of  the  sawtooth,  but,  of  course,  it  is
different for targets at different ranges. (If it is desired to have a constant intermediate frequency for different
ranges, which is a convenience in receiver design, then the modulation rate or the frequency deviation must
be adjusted.) Multiple targets at a variety of ranges will produce multiple-frequency outputs from the mixer
and frequently are handled in the receiver by using multiple range-bin Ô¨Ålters.
