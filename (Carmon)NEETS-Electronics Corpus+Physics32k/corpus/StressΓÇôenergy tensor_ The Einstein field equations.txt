In general relativity, the stress tensor is studied in the context of the Einstein field equations which are often written as

,


{\displaystyle R_{\mu \nu }-{\tfrac {1}{2}}R\,g_{\mu \nu }={8\pi G \over c^{4}}T_{\mu \nu },}

where




R

μ
ν




{\displaystyle R_{\mu \nu }}
is the Ricci tensor,



R


{\displaystyle R}
is the Ricci scalar (the tensor contraction of the Ricci tensor),




g

μ
ν





{\displaystyle g_{\mu \nu }\,}
the metric tensor, and



G


{\displaystyle G}
is the universal gravitational constant.
