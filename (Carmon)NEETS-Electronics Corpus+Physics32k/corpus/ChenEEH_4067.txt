We discuss the sampling theorem by assuming that signal
g (t) is strictly band-limited. In practice, however, an infor-
mation-bearing signal is not strictly band-limited, with the
result that some degree of under sampling is encountered.
Consequently, some aliasing is produced by the sampling pro-
cess. Aliasing refers to the phenomenon of a high-frequency
component in the spectrum of the signal seemingly taking on
the identity of a lower frequency in the spectrum of its sampled
version.
