When appropriate external force is applied to 
 electrons in the outermost shell, they are knocked 
loose and become free electrons. The movement of 
free electrons is called current. The external force 
needed to create this current is called voltage. As it 
travels along its path, the current encounters some 
 opposition, called resistance.
