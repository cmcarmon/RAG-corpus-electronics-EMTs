In the thermal-magnetic trip element circuit breaker, a magnetic element (electromagnet) is
connected in series with the circuit load, and a bimetallic element is heated by the load current. With
normal circuit current, the bimetallic element does not bend, and the magnetic element does not attract the
trip bar, as shown in figure 2-21, view A.
