The fast packets are statistically multiplexed onto a common physical link by the FPR sublayer for transmis-
sion. At  intermediate  nodes,  minor  error  checking,  fast  packet  framing,  fast  packet  switching,  and  queueing
takes place. If errors are found, then the fast packet is dropped. When the fast packets reach their destination,
they are reassembled into a frame by the FPA sublayer and passed on to the DLC sublayer where normal DLC
functions are performed.
