If an internal current produces a significant amount of flux, then a time-varying current will
a situation we have explicitly disallowed. Thus, the flux
produce a nonzero time-varying flux
resulting from an internal current must be negligible. If the flux is significant, then we will introduce
a new lumped element called the inductor and capture the flux inside it, thereby adhering to the
constraint.
