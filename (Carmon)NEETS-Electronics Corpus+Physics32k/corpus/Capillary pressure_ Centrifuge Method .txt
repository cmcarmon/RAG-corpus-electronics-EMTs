The centrifuge method relies on the following relationship between capillary pressure and gravity:





p

c


=
h
g
(

ρ

ρ

)


{\displaystyle p_{c}=hg(\rho _{w}-\rho _{nw})}

where:




h


{\displaystyle h}
is the height of the capillary rise




g


{\displaystyle g}
is gravity





ρ

w




{\displaystyle \rho _{w}}
is the density of the wetting phase





ρ

n
w




{\displaystyle \rho _{nw}}
is the density of the non-wetting phase
The centrifugal force essentially serves as an applied capillary pressure for small test plugs, often composed of brine and oil. During the centrifugation process, a given amount of brine is expelled from the plug at certain centrifugal rates of rotation. A glass vial measures the amount of fluid as it is being expelled, and these readings result in a curve that relates rotation speeds with drainage amounts. The rotation speed is correlated to capillary pressure by the following equation:

{\displaystyle p_{c}=7.9e^{-8}(\rho _{1}-\rho _{2})\omega ^{2}(r_{b}^{2}-r_{t}^{2})}

where:





r

{\displaystyle r_{b}}
is the radius of rotation of the bottom of the core sample





r

{\displaystyle r_{t}}
is the radius of rotation of the top of the core sample




ω


{\displaystyle \omega }
is the rotational speed
The primary benefits to this method are that it's rapid (producing curves in a matter of hours) and is not restricted to being performed at certain temperatures.
Other methods include the Vapor Pressure Method, Gravity-Equilibrium Method, Dynamic Method, Semi-dynamic Method, and the Transient Method.
