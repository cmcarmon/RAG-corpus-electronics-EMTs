The scattering effect because of snow is difficult to compute because of irregular sizes and shapes of 
the flakes. While information on the attenuating effect of snow is limited, scientists assume that 
attenuation from snow is less than from rain falling at an equal rate. This assumption is borne out by the 
fact that the density of rain is eight times the density of snow. As a result, rain falling at 1 inch per hour 
would have more water per cubic inch than snow falling at the same rate.
