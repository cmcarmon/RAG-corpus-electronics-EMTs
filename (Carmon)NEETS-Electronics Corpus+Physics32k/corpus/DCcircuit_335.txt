Once the victim has been safely disconnected from the source of electric power, the im-
mediate medical concerns for the victim should be respiration and circulation (breathing and
pulse). If the rescuer is trained in CPR, they should follow the appropriate steps of checking
for breathing and pulse, then applying CPR as necessary to keep the victim’s body from deoxy-
genating. The cardinal rule of CPR is to keep going until you have been relieved by qualiﬁed
personnel.
