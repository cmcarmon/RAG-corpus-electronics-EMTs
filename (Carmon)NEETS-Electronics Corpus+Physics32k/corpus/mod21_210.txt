To effectively test diodes used for computer applications, you must obtain back-resistance
measurements at a large number of different voltage levels. This can be done efficiently by using a
dynamic diode tester in conjunction with an oscilloscope, which is used to display the diodeâ€™s back-
current-versus-voltage curve. You can easily interpret diode characteristics, such as flutter, hysteresis, and
negative resistance, through use of the dynamic current and voltage display.
