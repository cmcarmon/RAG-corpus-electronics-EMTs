A simpliÔ¨Åed analysis of a round rotor generator illustrates the
important points of synchronous machine operation (see
Figure 4.22). The machine consists of a balanced three-phase
stator winding and a dc rotor winding. Assuming a steady-
state balanced operation, it is not necessary to consider the
effect of damper windings. The rotor to stator mutual induc-
tances are a function of the rotor angle. With a round rotor
machine, the stator to stator mutual inductances and the stator
self-inductances are constant:
