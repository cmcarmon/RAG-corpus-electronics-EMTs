Reactance 
 
When alternating voltages are applied to capacitors 
or  inductors  the  magnitude  of  the  current  flowing 
will  depend  upon  the  value  of  capacitance  or 
inductance and on the frequency of the voltage. In 
effect, capacitors and inductors oppose the flow of 
current  in  much  the  same  way  as  a  resistor.  The 
important  difference  being 
the  effective 
resistance  (or  reactance)  of  the  component  varies 
with frequency (unlike the case of a resistor where 
the magnitude of the current does not change with 
frequency).
