inputs that results in the worst-case power dissipation for the circuit. For the
simple inverter, this estimate is the power dissipated when the input is a logical 1
and the MOSFET is on, for example, as computed in Equation 11.21. Another
estimate is statistical, and is based on determining the expected power over
all possible input sets. Each input set is assigned an occurrence probability and
the power for that input set is determined. Then the expected power is com-
puted by averaging the power for each set of inputs weighted by the occurrence
probability for that input set. Yet another estimate assumes that each input to
the circuit is a square wave comprising an alternating sequence of logical 1’s
and 0’s.
