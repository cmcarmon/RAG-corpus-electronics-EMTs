The	Rosenstark	Method,	sometimes	called	Asymptotic	Gain	Model,	is	yet	another
important	subject	where	power	transfer	is	concerned.	In	light	of	the	return	ratio,	it
serves	as	the	representation	of	negative	gain	from	feedback	amplifiers.	As	it
provides	an	intuitive	form	of	circuit	analysis,	it	introduces	a	new	batch	of	elements
such	as	the	return	ratio	and	asymptotic	gains.
The	Rosenstark	formula:
