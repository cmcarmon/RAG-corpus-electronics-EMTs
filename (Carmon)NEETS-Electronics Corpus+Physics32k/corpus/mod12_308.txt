In frequency modulation, we saw that as the frequency of the modulating signal increased (assuming
the deviation remained constant) the number of significant sideband pairs decreased. This is shown in
views (A) and (B) of figure 2-21. Notice that although the total number of significant sidebands decreases
with a higher frequency-modulating signal, the sidebands spread out relative to each other; the total
bandwidth increases.
