under the gate. This channel provides the gate current to the
vertical n-p-n-p thyristor that latches due to regenerative feed-
back and conducts a large forward current with a low forward
voltage drop. During on-state conduction, the p-channel loses
control over MCT performance once the thyristor latches on,
and the Iâ€“V characteristics are independent of gate voltage
beyond the threshold voltage VTH of the channel. MCT turn-
off is accomplished by applying a high voltage of reverse
polarity at the gate. This creates an n-channel under the gate.
If the resistance of the channel is small enough, it will divert
the electron current
from the thyristor. This effectively
raises the holding current of the thyristor, thus forcing it to
turn-off.
