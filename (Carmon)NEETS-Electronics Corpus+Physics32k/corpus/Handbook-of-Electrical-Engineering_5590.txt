The effect of cumulative coordination-time delays is slowest clearing of faults with the largest fault currents.
This is not entirely satisfactory from the system point of view, and wherever possible, the inverse-time relays
are supplemented by instantaneous overcurrent relays. These relays, as the name implies, have no intentional
time delays and operate in less than one cycle. However, they cannot coordinate with the downstream relays
and therefore must not operate (“see”) for faults into the protection zone of the downstream relay. This criterion
is not always possible to meet. However, whenever it can be met, instantaneous relays are used and provide a
preferable compromise between fast fault clearing and coordinated backup protection.
