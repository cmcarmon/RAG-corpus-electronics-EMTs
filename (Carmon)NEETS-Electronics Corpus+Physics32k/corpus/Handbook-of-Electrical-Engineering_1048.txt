basis for many signal-processing algorithms, since many systems can be speciÔ¨Åed directly by their impulse or
frequency response. Property 3 (frequency shifting) is useful for analyzing the performance of communication
systems  where  different  modulation  formats  are  commonly  used  to  shift  spectral  energy  among  different
frequency bands.
