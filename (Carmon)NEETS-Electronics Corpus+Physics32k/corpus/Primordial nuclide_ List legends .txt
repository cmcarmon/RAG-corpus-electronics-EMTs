no (number)
A running positive integer for reference. These numbers may change slightly in the future since there are 163 nuclides now classified as stable, but which are theoretically predicted to be unstable (see Stable nuclide#Still-unobserved decay), so that future experiments may show that some are in fact unstable. The number starts at 254, to follow the 253 nuclides (or stable isotopes) not yet found to be radioactive.
nuclide column
Nuclide identifiers are given by their mass number A and the symbol for the corresponding chemical element (implies a unique proton number).
energy column
The column labeled "energy" denotes the mass of the average nucleon of this nuclide relative to the mass of a neutron (so all nuclides get a positive value) in MeV/c2, formally: mn âˆ’ mnuclide / A.
half-life column
All times are given in years.
decay mode column
decay energy column
Multiple values for (maximal) decay energy in MeV are mapped to decay modes in their order.
