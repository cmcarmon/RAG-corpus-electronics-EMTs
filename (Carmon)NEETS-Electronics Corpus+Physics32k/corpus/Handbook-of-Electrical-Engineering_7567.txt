A number of TTL logic function implementations are available with open collector outputs. For example,
the  7403  two-input  NAND  gate  shown  in  Fig. 79.10  is  the  open  collector  version  of  Fig. 79.8(a).  The  open
collector  output  has  some  useful  applications.  The  current  in  an  external  load  connected  between  the  open
collector and VCC can be switched on and off in response to the input combinations. This load, for example,
