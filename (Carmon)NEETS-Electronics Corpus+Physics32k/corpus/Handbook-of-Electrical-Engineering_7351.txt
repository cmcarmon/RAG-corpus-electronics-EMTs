Electrical telemeters proliferate through (1) space, (2) battleﬁelds, and (3) industrial sites, varying in size,
conﬁguration, and information-carrying capacity with their various applications. Space research and missile
development  used  the  ﬁrst  signiﬁcant  multichannel  telemeters.  Telemeters  developed  at  the  Naval  Research
Laboratories and built by the Raytheon Company were ﬁrst used to explore outside the earth’s atmosphere in
German V-2  rockets  launched  at  the White  Sands  Proving  Ground.  These  telemeters  used  1000-MHz  pulse
position modulated signals at ranges greater than 100 miles. Conrad H. Hoeppner designed the equipment and
managed the installations and operation. From 1945 onward, telemetry developed rapidly and found its way
to the various missile ranges also being developed.
