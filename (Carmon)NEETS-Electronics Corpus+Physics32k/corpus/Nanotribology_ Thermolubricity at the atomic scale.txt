With the introduction of AFM and FFM, thermal effects on lubricity at the atomic scale could not be considered negligible any more. Thermal excitation can result in multiple jumps of the tip in the direction of the slide and backward. When the sliding velocity is low, the tip takes a long time to move between low potential energy points and thermal motion can cause it to make a lot of spontaneous forward and reverse jumps: therefore, the required lateral force to make the tip follow the slow support motion is small, so the friction force becomes very low.
For this situation was introduced the term thermolubricity.
