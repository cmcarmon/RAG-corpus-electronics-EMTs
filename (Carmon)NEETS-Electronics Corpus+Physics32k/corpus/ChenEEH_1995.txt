Microrollback is a technique that is coupled with concurrent
error detection mechanisms (such as FD arithmetic circuits
[see Section 8.2] and program CFC [see Section 8.4]) and
allows a processor system to recover from detected errors by
going back to a state prior to the occurrence of these errors and
restarting execution from that point. In general, to perform
such a rollback to a previous state, it is necessary to have copies
of all previous states of the system up to a certain time interval.
Because a lot of memory is required to store this kind of
information, it is necessary to consider the fact that only a
reduced number of snapshots of previous states can be kept.
Due to this limitation, it is necessary to determine critical
points, called checkpoints at which we need to or it is appro-
priate to store the state of the system (Bowden and Pradhan,
1992; Chandy and Ramamoorthy). This decision process is
important for software rollback, but is too complex for a
completely hardware solution.
