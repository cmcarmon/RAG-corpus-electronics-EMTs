Angles of departure and arrival: The slope of the root locus in the vicinity of a pole of G(s)H(s) is measured
as the angle of departure, and that in the vicinity of a zero of G(s)H(s) is measured as the angle of arrival.
Asymptotes of root loci: The behavior of the root loci at *s* = Â¥ when the number of poles and zeros of G(s)H(s)
