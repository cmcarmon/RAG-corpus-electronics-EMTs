View A of figure 2-4 shows the modulator switch open and the storage element charging. With the
modulator switch open, the transmitter produces no power output, but the storage element stores a large
amount of energy. View B shows the modulator switch closed and the storage element discharging
through the transmitter. The energy stored by the storage element is released in the form of a high-power,
dc modulator pulse. The transmitter converts the dc modulator pulse to an rf pulse, which is radiated into
space by the radar antenna. Thus, the modulator switch is closed for the duration of a transmitted rf pulse,
but open between pulses.
