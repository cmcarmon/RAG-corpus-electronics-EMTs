Stokes's law of sound attenuation is a formula for the attenuation of sound in a Newtonian fluid, such as water or air, due to the fluid's viscosity. It states that the amplitude of a plane wave decreases exponentially with distance traveled, at a rate

where



η


{\displaystyle \eta }
is the dynamic viscosity coefficient of the fluid,



ω


{\displaystyle \omega }
is the sound's angular frequency,



ρ


{\displaystyle \rho }
is the fluid density, and



V


{\displaystyle V}
is the speed of sound in the medium:
The law and its derivation were published in 1845 by physicist G. G. Stokes, who also developed the well-known Stokes's law for the friction force in fluid motion.
