This is a noninverting ampliﬁer which works well for low- to moderate-Q ﬁlters and is easily tuned [Budak,
1974].  For  high-Q  ﬁlters  the  sensitivity  of  Q  to  element  values  becomes  high,  and  alternative  circuits  are
recommended. One of these is the bandpass version of the inverting ampliﬁer ﬁlter as shown in Fig. 29.19.
