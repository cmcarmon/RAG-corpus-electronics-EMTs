Today most homes have three-wire connections to their outlets, one of which is shown in
Figure 4.4.3. The need for both ground and neutral connections needs to be explained, since the
ground conductor may appear to be redundant, playing no role in the actual operation of a load that
might be connected to the receptacle. From the viewpoint of safety, the ground connection is used
to connect the metallic chassis of the appliance to earth ground. Without the ground conductor
connected to the metal case of the appliance, as shown in Figure 4.4.4(a), the appliance chassis
could be at any potential with respect to ground, possibly even at the “hot” wire’s potential if a part
of the “hot” wire were to lose some insulation and come in contact with the inside of the chassis.
An unintended connection may occur because of the corrosion of insulation or a loose mechanical
connection. Poorly grounded appliances can thus be a signiﬁcant hazard by providing a path to
ground through the body of a person touching the chassis with a hand. An undersized ground
loop current limited by the body resistance may ﬂow directly through the body to ground and
could be quite harmful. Typically, the circuit breaker would not operate under such circumstances.
