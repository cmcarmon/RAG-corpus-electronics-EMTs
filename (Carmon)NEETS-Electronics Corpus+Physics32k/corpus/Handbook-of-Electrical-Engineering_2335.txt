Small-Signal Equivalent Circuit Model
In  a  small-signal  equivalent  circuit  model,  the  signal  variations  around  the  dc-bias  operating  point  are  very
small.  Just  as  for  the  large-signal  model,  there  are  two  types  of  small-signal  models,  depending  upon  the
operating frequency: (1) the high-frequency small-signal equivalent circuit model and (2) the low-frequency
small-signal equivalent circuit model.
