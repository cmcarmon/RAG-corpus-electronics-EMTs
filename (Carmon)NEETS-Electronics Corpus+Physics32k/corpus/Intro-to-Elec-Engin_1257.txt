13.3.10 A 2300-V, three-phase, wye-connected, round-
rotor synchronous motor has a synchronous reac-
tance of 3  per phase and an armature resistance
of 0.25  per phase. The motor operates on load
with a power angle of −15°, and the excitation is
adjusted so that the internally induced voltage
is equal in magnitude to the terminal voltage.
Determine:
(a) The armature current.
(b) The power factor of the motor.
Neglect the effect of armature resistance.
