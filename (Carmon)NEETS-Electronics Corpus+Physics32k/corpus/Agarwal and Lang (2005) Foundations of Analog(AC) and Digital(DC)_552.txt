Let us start with Network A. First, let us find the Thévenin equivalent circuit. Shorting
the voltage source results in the circuit shown in Figure 3.92. Therefore, RTH = RN =
R1(cid:2)R2 = R1R2/(R1 + R2), where RTH and RN are the Thévenin and Norton equivalent
resistors, respectively. From the voltage-divider relationship, open circuit voltage voc
is VR2/(R1 + R2). This yields the Thévenin equivalent circuit on the left-hand side of
Figure 3.93.
