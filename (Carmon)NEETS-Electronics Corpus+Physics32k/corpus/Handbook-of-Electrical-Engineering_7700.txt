is  an  electromagnet  that  produces  switchable  magnetic  ﬁelds  to  read  and  record  bit
, attached to an actuator. The head “ﬂies” close to,
streams on a platter’s track. It is associated with a disk 
but never touches, the rotating platter (except perhaps when powered down). This is the classical deﬁnition of
The actuator is a mechanical assembly that positions the head electronics over the appro-
a 
priate track. It is possible to have multiple read/write mechanisms per surface, e.g., multiple heads per arm—at
one extreme, one could have a head-per-track position, that is, the disk equivalent of a magnetic drum—or
