Permeability was defined as the measure of the ability of a material to act as a path for additional
magnetic lines of force. Soft iron was presented as having high permeability compared with air. In fact,
the permeability of unmagnetized iron is 5000 while air has a permeability of 1. A nonmagnetized piece
of iron has high permeability because the tiny molecular magnets (Weber's Theory) or the directions of
electron spin (Domain Theory) are able to be aligned by a magnetic field. As they align, they act as a path
for the magnetic lines of force.
