The single capacitor filter is suitable for many noncritical, low-current applications. However, when 
the load resistance is very low or when the percent of ripple must be held to an absolute minimum, the 
capacitor value required must be extremely large. While electrolytic capacitors are available in sizes up to 
10,000 microfarads or greater, the large sizes are quite expensive. A more practical approach is to use a 
more sophisticated filter that can do the same job but that has lower capacitor values, such as the RC 
filter.
