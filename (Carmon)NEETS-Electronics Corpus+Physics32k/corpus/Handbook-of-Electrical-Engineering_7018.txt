Bandwidth and Capacity
The foregoing formulas for discrete channels do not lead to the capacity of continuous-time channels such as
Example 5. We have seen that in the case of the telephone channel whose bandwidth is approximately equal to
3 kHz, capacity is lower bounded by 28,800 bits per second. How does bandwidth translate into capacity? The
answer depends on the noise level and distribution. For example, if in the channel of Example 5, the noise is
absent, capacity is inÔ¨Ånite regardless of bandwidth. We can encode any amount of information as the binary
expansion of a single scalar, which can be sent over the channel as the amplitude or phase of a single sinusoid;
knowing the channel transfer function, the decoder can recover the transmitted scalar error-free. Clearly, such
a  transmission  method  is  not  recommended  in  practice  because  it  hinges  on  the  non-physical  scenario  of
noiseless transmission.
