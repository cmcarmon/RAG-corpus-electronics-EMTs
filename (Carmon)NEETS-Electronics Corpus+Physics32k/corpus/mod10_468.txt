In figure 3-18, a battery is connected through a relatively long two-wire transmission line to a load at
the far end of the line. At the instant the switch is closed, neither current nor voltage exists on the line.
When the switch is closed, point A becomes a positive potential, and point B becomes negative. These
points of difference in potential move down the line. However, as the initial points of potential leave
points A and B, they are followed by new points of difference in potential which the battery adds at A and
B. This is merely saying that the battery maintains a constant potential difference between points A and
B. A short time after the switch is closed, the initial points of difference in potential have reached points
A’ and B’; the wire sections from points A to A’ and points B to B’ are at the same potential as A and B,
respectively. The points of charge are represented by plus (+) and minus (-) signs along the wires. The
directions of the currents in the wires are represented by the arrowheads on the line, and the direction of
travel is indicated by an arrow below the line. Conventional lines of force represent the electric field that
exists between the opposite kinds of charge on the wire sections from A to A’ and B to B’. Crosses (tails
of arrows) indicate the magnetic field created by the electric field moving down the line. The moving
electric field and the accompanying magnetic field constitute an electromagnetic wave that is moving
from the generator (battery) toward the load. This wave travels at approximately the speed of light in free
space. The energy reaching the load is equal to that developed at the battery (assuming there are no losses
in the transmission line). If the load absorbs all of the energy, the current and voltage will be evenly
distributed along the line.
