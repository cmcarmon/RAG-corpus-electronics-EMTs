The velocity (or speed) of a radio wave radiated into free space by a transmitting antenna is equal to 
the speed of lightâ€”186,000 miles per second or 300,000,000 meters per second. Because of various 
factors, such as barometric pressure, humidity, molecular content, etc., radio waves travel inside the 
Earth's atmosphere at a speed slightly less than the speed of light. Normally, in discussions of the velocity 
of radio waves, the velocity referred to is the speed at which radio waves travel in free space.
