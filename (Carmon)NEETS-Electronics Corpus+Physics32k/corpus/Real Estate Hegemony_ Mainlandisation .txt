Since 2012, there has been an influx of the Mainland Chinese capital into the Hong Kong's property market and replacing the traditional Hong Kong real estate conglomerates in various fields as the Beijing government grows its influence in the city's political, economic, and social affairs.
The bidding of the government's land by seven major land development companies, Sun Hung Kai Properties, Cheung Kong Holdings, Henderson Land Development, Nan Fung Group, New World Development, Sino Land and Wheelock & Co, has significantly decreased from the 45 per cent of the total share in 2012 to 22 per cent in 2016, losing to the Mainland land development companies. The proportion of the seven land development companies in the private homes is estimated to drop from 85 per cent in 2014 down to 53 per cent in 2017â€“19.
The Mainland Chinese companies such as HNA Group and Logan Property Holdings have outbid the local contenders for expensive land in the recent years, account for HK$37 billion worth of the government land sold for residential development in 2017. Chen Feng's HNA outbid 19 contenders with a record HK$8.84 billion in the government land sites in the former Kai Tak airport area.
