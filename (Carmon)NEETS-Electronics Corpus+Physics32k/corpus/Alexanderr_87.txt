Situations often arise in circuit analysis when the resistors are neither in
parallel nor in series. For example, consider the bridge circuit in Fig. 2.46.
How do we combine resistors 
through  when the resistors are neither
in  series  nor  in  parallel?  Many  circuits  of  the  type  shown  in  Fig.  2.46
can be simpliÔ¨Åed by using three-terminal equivalent networks. These are
