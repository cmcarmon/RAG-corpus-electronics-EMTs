The block diagrams of complex feedback control systems usually contain several feedback
loops, which might have to be simpliÔ¨Åed in order to evaluate an overall transfer function for the
system. A few of the block diagram reduction manipulations are given in Table 16.2.1; no attempt
is made to cover all possibilities.
