Power Transistor
Power  transistors  are  used  in  applications  ranging  from  a  few  to  several  hundred  kilowatts  and  switching
npn
frequencies  up  to  about  10  kHz.  Power  transistors  used  in  power  conversion  applications  are  generally 
type.  The  power  transistor  is  turned  on  by  supplying  sufﬁcient  base  current,  and  this  base  drive  has  to  be
maintained throughout its conduction period. It is turned off by removing the base drive and making the base
voltage slightly negative (within –
). The saturation voltage of the device is normally 0.5 to 2.5 V and
increases as the current increases. Hence the on-state losses increase more than proportionately with current.
The transistor off-state losses are much lower than the on-state losses because the leakage current of the device
is of the order of a few milliamperes. Because of relatively larger switching times, the switching loss signiﬁcantly
increases with switching frequency. Power transistors can block only forward voltages. The reverse peak voltage
rating of these devices is as low as 5 to 10 V.
