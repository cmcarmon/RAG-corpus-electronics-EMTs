The Daedalus Matrix2 is a 5-cell competitive CF canopy using crossbraced technology with fewer lines. NZ Aerosports say the wing revolutionizes the idea of how a CRW canopy should land. Itâ€™s said to have tons of flare even on straight in approaches. The rears have lots of range, are easy to land with and give you another powerful tool to use in the air. Aussie CRW Team Ookoonono do 270 to 630 approaches with the wing and say they land almost as well as a crossbraced sports canopy. The trim is not set too steep but the reduced drag still means that the Matrix2 dives more than a 7-Cell. The result is that the wing can be flown efficiently with a small amount of brakes and just needs to be released to accelerate.
