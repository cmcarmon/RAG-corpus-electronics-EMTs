Figure 45-25 shows a truth table based on these 
rules. The letter D represents the difference column. 
The borrow column is represented by B0. Notice that 
the difference output (D) is 1 only when the input 
variables are not equal. Therefore, the difference can 
be expressed as the exclusive OR of the input variables. 
The output borrow is generated only when A is 0 and 
B is 1. Therefore, the borrow output is the complement 
of A “AND”ed with B.
