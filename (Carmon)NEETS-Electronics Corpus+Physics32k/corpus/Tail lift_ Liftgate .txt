In North America, "liftgate" is the commonly used term for a hydraulic lift installed at the rear of a vehicle that can be used to mechanically load or unload cargo.
In the automobile industry, "liftgate" is also used to refer to the automatic rear door of a van, mini van, or cross over (SUV) type vehicle. This opening system is also sometimes called a "rear hatch."
