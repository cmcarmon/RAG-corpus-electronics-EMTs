A point defect may exhibit apparent gain because the backscatter coefficient of the fiber present
before the point defect is higher than that of the fiber present after. Test personnel measure the signal loss
or gain by positioning a pair of cursors, one on each side of the point defect. Figure 5-16 illustrates the
positioning of the cursors for a point defect showing an apparent signal gain. The trace after the point
defect is extrapolated as shown in figure 5-16. The vertical distance between the two lines in figure 5-16
is the apparent gain of the point defect.
