It is generally desired to keep the read/write head stationary while the disk spins and a given track is being
read from or written onto. Thus, in an ideal situation, not only should the track be perfectly circular, but also
the disk must be precisely centered on the spindle axis. In practical systems, however, tracks are neither precisely
circular, nor are they concentric with the spindle axis. These eccentricity problems are solved in low-perfor-
mance ﬂoppy drives by making tracks wide enough to provide tolerance for misregistrations and misalignments.
Thus the head moves blindly to a radius where the track center is nominally expected to be and stays put until
the reading or writing is over. By making the head narrower than the track pitch, the track center is allowed
to wobble around its nominal position without signiﬁcantly degrading the performance during the read/write
operation.  This  kind  of  wobble,  however,  is  unacceptable  in  optical  disk  systems,  which  have  a  very  narrow
track, about the same size as the focused beam spot. In a typical situation arising in practice, the eccentricity
of a given track may be as much as –50 mm while the track pitch is only about 1 mm, thus requiring active
track-following procedures.
