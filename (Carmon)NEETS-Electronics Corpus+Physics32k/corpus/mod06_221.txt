There are two disadvantages associated with cathode biasing. To maintain bias voltage continuously,
current must flow through the tube, and plate voltage will never be able to reach the maximum value of
the source voltage. This, in turn, limits the maximum positive output for a negative input signal
(remember the 180ยบ inversion). In addition, maximum plate voltage is decreased by the amount of
cathode-biasing voltage. What this means is that you can't get something for nothing. If the cathode is
biased at +20 volts, this voltage must be subtracted from the plate voltage. As an example, consider a
triode with a 10,000 ohm plate resistor and a +300 volts dc source voltage. If a current of 2 milliamperes
flows through the tube under quiescent conditions, 20 volts are dropped across the plate-load resistor. The
maximum plate voltage is then 300 volts - 20 volts = 280 volts dc. Now, consider the 20-volt dropped
across the cathode resistor. Plate voltage becomes 280 volts - 20 volts = 260 volts. To understand this a
little more thoroughly, look at figure 1-24. In view A, the source voltage is 300 volts dc. There are two
ways that this voltage can be looked at; either the plate is at +300 volts and the cathode is at 0 volts
(ground), or the plate is at +150 volts and the cathode is at -150 volts. In electronics, it is common
practice to assume that the plate is at +300 volts while the cathode is at 0 volts. To simplify this
discussion, we will assume that the plate is at +150 volts, and the cathode is at -150 volts. The potential
difference between the plate and the cathode is 300 volts. If a plate-load resistor is installed, as shown in
view B,  20 volts are dropped by R
