MECHANICAL and FUSION SPLICING are two broad categories that describe the techniques
used for fiber splicing. A mechanical splice is a fiber splice where mechanical fixtures perform fiber
alignment and connection. A fusion splice is a fiber splice where localized heat fuses or melts the ends of
two lengths of optical fiber together.
