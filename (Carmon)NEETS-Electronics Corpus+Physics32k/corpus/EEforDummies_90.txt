Because the electrons move in only one direction (from the negative terminal, 
through the circuit, to the positive terminal), the electric current generated 
by a battery is DC. The AAA‐, AA‐, C‐, and D‐size batteries you can buy almost 
anywhere each generate about 1.5 volts — regardless of size. The difference 
in size among those batteries has to do with how much current can be drawn 
from them. The larger the battery, the more current can be drawn, and the 
longer it will last. Larger batteries can handle heavier loads, which is just a 
way of saying they can produce more power (remember, power = voltage × 
current), so they can do more work.
