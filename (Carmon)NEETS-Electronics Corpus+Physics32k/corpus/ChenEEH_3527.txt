Shift Invariance (or Time Invariance)
A shift-invariant or time-invariant system is one where the
response of a system to a shifted version of an original input is
the same as the shifted version of the system’s response to the
original input. Consider a discrete-time system T such that
the output corresponding to an input x[n] is y[n] ¼ T (x[n]).
The system T is shift invariant if:
