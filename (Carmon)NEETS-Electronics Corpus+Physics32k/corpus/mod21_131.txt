The meter (M301) contains four scales. The upper scale is graduated from 0 to 100 for direct
numerical readings. The three lower scales, numbered 1, 2, and 3, are read for LEAKAGE, QUALITY,
and GAS, respectively. Each numbered scale includes green and red areas marked GOOD and
REPLACE. Inside a shield directly in front of the meter are five neon lamps (DS301 through DS305),
which indicate shorts between tube elements.
