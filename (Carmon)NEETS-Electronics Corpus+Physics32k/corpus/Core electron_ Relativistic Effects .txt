For elements with high atomic number Z, relativistic effects can be observed for core shell electrons. The velocities of core shell s electrons reach relativistic momentum which leads to contraction of 6s orbitals relative to 5d orbitals. Physical properties effected by these relativistic effects include lowered melting temperature of mercury and the observed golden colour of gold and caesium due to narrowing of energy gap. Gold appears yellow because it absorbs blue light more than it absorbs other visible wavelengths of light and so reflects back yellow-toned light.
