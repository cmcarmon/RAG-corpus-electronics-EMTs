The smallest signal that can be ampliﬁed is always limited by the inherent random noise internal to the op
amp  itself.  In  Fig.  27.3  the  noise  effects  are  represented  by  an  equivalent  input  voltage  source  (ENV),  which
when multiplied by the gain of the op amp would equal the total output noise present if the inputs to the op
amp were shorted. In a similar fashion, if the inputs to the op amp were open circuited, the total output noise
would equal the sum of the noise due to the equivalent input current sources (ENI+ and ENI–), each multiplied
by  their  respective  current  gain  to  the  output.  Because  noise  is  a  random  variable,  this  summation  must  be
accomplished in a squared fashion, i.e.,
