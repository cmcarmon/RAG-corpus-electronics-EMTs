In this example, we will compare the actual characteristics of the BJT with those predicted
by a simple piecewise linear model. The actual characteristics of a BJT (iC versus vCE for
various values of iB) are shown in Figure 7.48. The horizontal nature of the iC versus vCE
curves indicates that the device operates like a dependent current source when the base
current iB > 0 and the collector-to-emitter voltage (vCE) is greater than approximately
0.2 V. The current supplied by the current source is typically about 100 times the base
current. Although these curves are qualitatively similar to those of a MOSFET, there
are also some differences. First, notice that we have chosen the BJTâ€™s base current iB
