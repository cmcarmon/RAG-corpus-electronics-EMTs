Figure 7.21 plots vO versus vIN for the MOSFET amplifier. This decidedly
nonlinear relationship is called the transfer function of the amplifier. When
vIN < VT, the MOSFET is off and the output voltage is VS. In other words,
iD = 0 when vIN < VT. As vIN increases beyond the threshold voltage VT,
so does the current sustained by the MOSFET. Therefore vO rapidly decreases
as vIN increases. The MOSFET operates in the saturation region until the out-
put voltage vO falls one threshold below the gate voltage, at which point the
MOSFET enters the triode region (shown as a dashed line in Figure 7.21), and
the saturation model and Equation 7.14 are no longer valid.
