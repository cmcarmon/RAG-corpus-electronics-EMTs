Does any error-correcting code reduce communication errors when real-world constraints are taken into
account? The answer now is yes. To understand channel coding, we need to develop ﬁrst a general framework
for channel coding, and discover what it takes for a code to be maximally eﬃcient: Correct as many errors
as possible using the fewest error correction bits as possible (making the eﬃciency K/N as large as possible).

So-called linear codes create error-correction bits by combining the data bits linearly. The phrase “linear
combination” means here single-bit binary arithmetic.
