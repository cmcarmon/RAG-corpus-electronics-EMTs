Suppose that a transition t is enabled by n tokens and the
fuzzy enabling time et (t) of transition t is computed by
et(t) ¼ latest {pi(t), i ¼ 1, 2, . . ., n}, where latest is the oper-
ator that constructs the ‘‘latest-arrival-lowest-possibility distri-
bution’’ from n distributions (Murata, 1996; Murata et al.,
1999). The pi(t) is the fuzzy time stamp to which the enabling
token arrives at the ith input place of transition t. When there
are m transitions in structural conﬂict that are enabled with
their fuzzy enabling times, ei(t), i ¼ 1, 2, . . ., t, . . ., m, and
with their possibility intervals, pi[ai, bi], we compute the
fuzzy occurrence time ot (t) of transition t whose fuzzy enab-
ling time is et(t) as follows:
ot(t) ¼ min {et(t)  pi(at, at, bt, bt),
