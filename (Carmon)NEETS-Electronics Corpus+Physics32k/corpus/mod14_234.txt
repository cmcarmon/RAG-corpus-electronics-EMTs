A Truth Table representing an AND gate with three inputs (X, Y, and Z) is shown below. Remember
that the two-input AND gate has four possible combinations, with only one of those combinations
providing a HIGH output. An AND gate with three inputs has eight possible combinations, again with
only one combination providing a HIGH output. Make sure you include all possible combinations. To
check if you have all combinations, raise 2 to the power equal to the number of input variables. This will
give you the total number of possible combinations. For example:
