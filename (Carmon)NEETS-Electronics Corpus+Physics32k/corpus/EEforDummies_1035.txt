When you aren’t using it, keep your breadboard in a resealable plastic bag. 
Why? To keep out the dust. Dirty contacts make for poor electrical connec-
tions. Although you can use a spray‐on electrical cleaner to remove dust 
and other contaminants, you make things easier on yourself by keeping the 
breadboard clean in the first place.
