Terminology and Physics
Lightning is a transient, high-current electric spark whose length is measured in kilometers. Lightning discharges
can occur within a cloud, between clouds, from cloud to air, and from cloud to ground. All discharges except
the latter are known as cloud discharges. The usual cloud-to-ground lightning is initiated in the cloud, lasts
about half a second, and lowers to ground some 20 to 30 Coulombs of negative cloud charge. A less frequent
type of cloud-to-ground discharge, accounting for less than 10% of all cloud-to-ground lightning, also begins
