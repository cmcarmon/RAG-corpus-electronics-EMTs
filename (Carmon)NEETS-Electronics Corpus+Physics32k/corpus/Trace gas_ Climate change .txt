The Earth's climate is sensitive to changes in trace gas concentrations and temperature of the upper troposphere - lower stratosphere region of the atmosphere (UTLS). This zone extends from 6 to 25 km above sea level where the interaction between radiation and trace gases, clouds and aerosols can lead to important climate feedback. Trace gases can be short lived or long lived. The first category includes several greenhouse gases (e.g. CO2, CH4, N2O or CFCs), whilst the latter encompasses species with a lifetime equal to or less than a few months (O3, nitrogen oxides, VOCs, CO etc).
