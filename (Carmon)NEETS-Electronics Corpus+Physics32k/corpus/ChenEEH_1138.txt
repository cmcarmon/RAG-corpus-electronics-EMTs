worthy. Figure 6.12 shows two other commercial microaccele-
rometers in which the manufacturers have used separate
substrates
elements.
A remarkable feature of the available microaccelerometers is
the very low mass, on the order of a microgram, for the
moving element. A cube of water 100 mm on an edge weighs
1 mg! Despite this miniscule mass, the sensitive electronics
enable the devices to measure a few one-thousandths of
normal gravity. Prototype MEMS devices have measured ac-
celerations exceeding 10,000 times normal gravity.
