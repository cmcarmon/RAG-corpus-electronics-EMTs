Most capacitors are inexact beasts. The actual capacitance of the capacitor 
can vary quite a bit from the nominal capacitance. Manufacturing varia-
tions cause this problem; capacitor makers aren’t just out to confuse you. 
Fortunately, the inexactness is seldom an issue in home‐brewed circuits. Still, 
you need to know about these variations so that if a circuit calls for a higher‐
precision capacitor, you know what to buy. As with resistors, capacitors are 
rated by their tolerance, which is expressed as a percentage.
