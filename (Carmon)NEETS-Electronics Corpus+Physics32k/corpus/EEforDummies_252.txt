Limiting current
The circuit in Figure 5­2 shows a 6‐volt battery supplying current to a light‐
emitting diode (LED) through a resistor (shown as a zigzag). LEDs (like 
many other electronic parts) eat up current like a kid eats candy: They try 
to gobble up as much as you give them. But LEDs run into a problem — they 
burn themselves out if they draw too much current. The resistor in the cir­
cuit serves the useful function of limiting the amount of current sent to the 
LED (the way a good parent restricts the intake of candy).
