In some operating systems, such as UNIX, there is a special
concept called pipe, which is a pseudo-ﬁle that can be used to
connect two processes together. When a process wants to send
data to another process, it writes on the pipe as though it were
an input ﬁle for the second process. Thus, communication
between processes looks very much like ordinary ﬁle reads
and writes.
