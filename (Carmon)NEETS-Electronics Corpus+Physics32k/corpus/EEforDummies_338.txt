Calculating an unknown resistance
Say you have a large flashlight that you’re running off a 12‐volt battery, and 
you measure a current of 1.3 A through the circuit. (I discuss how to measure 
current in Chapter 16.) You can calculate the resistance of the incandescent 
bulb by taking the voltage across the bulb (12 V) and dividing it by the cur-
rent through the bulb (1.3 A). It’s a pretty quick number‐crunch:
