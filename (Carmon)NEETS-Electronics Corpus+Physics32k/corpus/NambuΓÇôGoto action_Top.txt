The Nambu–Goto action is the simplest invariant action in bosonic string theory, and is also used in other theories that investigate string-like objects (for example, cosmic strings). It is the starting point of the analysis of zero-thickness (infinitely thin) string behavior, using the principles of Lagrangian mechanics. Just as the action for a free point particle is proportional to its proper time — i.e., the "length" of its world-line — a relativistic string's action is proportional to the area of the sheet which the string traces as it travels through spacetime.
It is named after Japanese physicists Yoichiro Nambu and Tetsuo Goto.
