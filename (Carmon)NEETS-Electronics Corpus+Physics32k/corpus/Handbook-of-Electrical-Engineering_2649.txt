As a result of these larger ﬁelds along the channel direction, a small fraction of the channel carriers have
enough  energy  to  enter  the  insulating  layer  near  the  drain.  In  silicon-based  p-channel  MOSFETs,  energetic
holes  can  become  trapped  in  the  oxide,  leading  to  a  positive  oxide  charge  near  the  drain  that  reduces  the
strength of the channel, degrading device behavior. In n-channel MOSFETs, energetic electrons entering the
oxide create interface traps and oxide wear-out, eventually leading to gate-to-drain shorts [Pimbley et al., 1989].
To cope with these problems “drain-engineering” has been tried, the most common solution being the lightly
doped drain [Chen, 1990; Einspruch and Gildenblat, 1989; Pimbley et al., 1989]. In this design, a lightly doped
extension of the drain is inserted between the channel and the drain proper. To keep the ﬁeld moderate and
reduce  any  peaks  in  the  ﬁeld,  the  lightly  doped  drain  extension  is  designed  to  spread  the  drain-to-channel
voltage drop as evenly as possible. The aim is to smooth out the ﬁeld at a value close to Fsat so that energetic
carriers are kept to a minimum. The expense of this solution is an increase in drain resistance and a decreased
gain. To increase packing density, this lightly doped drain extension can be stacked vertically alongside the gate,
rather than laterally under the gate, to control the overall device area.
