For maximum transfer of the power out of an rf source, with minimum heating from reflected power,
the total output impedance sensed by the rf source must be equal to the internal impedance of that source.
A perfect impedance match between transmitter and load would exist if the swr were 1 to 1. As discussed
in NEETS, module 10, test equipment designed to measure the instantaneous voltage of a standing wave
will give you a voltage standing-wave ratio (vswr). Test equipment designed to measure the instantaneous
current component of a standing wave will give you the current standing-wave ratio (iswr). Regardless of
the type of test equipment selected, both ratios will be the same.
