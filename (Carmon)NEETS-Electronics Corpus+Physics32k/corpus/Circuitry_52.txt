where 9 is the flux (in Webers) and A is the area of 
the field (in square metres). 
 
In  order  to  increase  the  strength  of  the  field,  a 
conductor may be shaped into a loop (Fig. 1.12) or 
coiled to form a  solenoid (Fig. 1.13). Note, in the 
latter case, how the field pattern is exactly the same 
as that which surrounds a bar magnet. We will see
