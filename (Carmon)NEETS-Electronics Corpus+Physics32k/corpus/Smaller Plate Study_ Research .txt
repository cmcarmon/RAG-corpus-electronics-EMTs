Studies by professor Brian Wansink, founder of the Cornell Food and Brand Lab have observed that people serve themselves in proportion to the plate size that they have been given. For example, while 3 ounces of pasta on a 10 inch plate look like a sizeable portion, the same amount on a 12 inch plate looks comparatively much smaller. This is thought to occur as a result of the Delboeuf illusion, whereby the size of the dinnerware creates two opposing biases that lead people to over-serve on larger plates and bowls and underserve on smaller ones.
As a result, a person tends to over-serve onto larger plates, and because people consume 92% of what they serve themselves, larger plates lead to larger food intake.
The study found that reducing plate size from 12 inches to 10 inches typically results in 22% less calories being served, as the smaller plate makes a normal serving seem more filling. However, the study found a lower limit for the effect; once plate size went below 9.5 inches "people begin to realize they're tricking themselves and go back for seconds and thirds."
The study predicted that using a 10 inch plate for a year would lead to a weight loss of 18 pounds for the average adult.
