FET characteristics 
 
As with bipolar transistors, the characteristics of a 
FET  are  often  presented  in  the  form  of  a  set  of 
graphs  relating  voltage  and  current  present  at  the 
typical  mutual 
transistorâ€™s 
characteristic  (ID plotted against VGS) for a small-
signal  general-purpose  N-channel  JFET  operating 
in common-source mode (see Chapter 7) is shown 
in Fig. 5.29. This characteristic shows that the drain 
current is progressively reduced as the gate-source 
voltage  is  made  more  negative.  At  a  certain  value 
of VGS the drain current falls to zero and the device 
is said to be cut-off.
