Now, let's determine the linearity, electrical length, and amplitude of the output waveform. First, the 
linearity: To charge the circuit to the full 20 volts will take 5 time constants. In the circuit shown in figure 
3-44, view (B), C1 is allowed to charge from T2 to T3. To find the percentage of charge, use the equation:
