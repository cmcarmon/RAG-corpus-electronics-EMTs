e) Assume that VT = 1 V, K = 2 mA/V2, R = 1 k, and VS = 10 V. Under this
assumption, design the input bias voltage to satisfy the following two objectives:
First, MOSFET operation must remain within the saturation region for |vin| â‰¤
0.25 V. Second, the output resistance of the small-signal model must be minimized.
