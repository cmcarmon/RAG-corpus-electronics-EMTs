ABET EC 2000 criteria (3.b), “an ability to design and con-
duct experiments, as well as to analyze and interpret data.”
Engineers must be able to design and conduct experiments, as well as
analyze and interpret data.  Most students have spent many hours per-
forming  experiments  in  high  school  and  in  college.  During  this  time,
you  have  been  asked  to  analyze  the  data  and  to  interpret  the  data.
Therefore,  you  should  already  be  skilled  in  these  two  activities.  My
recommendation  is  that,  in  the  process  of  performing  experiments  in
the future, you spend more time in analyzing and interpreting the data
in the context of the experiment. What does this mean?
