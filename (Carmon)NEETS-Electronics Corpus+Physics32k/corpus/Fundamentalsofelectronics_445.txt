Singers modify vocal cord tension to change the pitch to produce the desired musical note. Vocal cord
tension is governed by a control input to the musculature; in system’s models we represent control inputs as
signals coming into the top or bottom of the system. Certainly in the case of speech and in many other cases
as well, it is the control input that carries information, impressing it on the system’s output. The change of
signal structure resulting from varying the control input enables information to be conveyed by the signal,
a process generically known as modulation. In singing, musicality is largely conveyed by pitch; in western
speech, pitch is much less important. A sentence can be read in a monotone fashion without completely
destroying the information expressed by the sentence. However, the diﬀerence between a statement and a
question is frequently expressed by pitch changes. For example, note the sound diﬀerences between “Let’s
go to the park” and “Let’s go to the park?”;
