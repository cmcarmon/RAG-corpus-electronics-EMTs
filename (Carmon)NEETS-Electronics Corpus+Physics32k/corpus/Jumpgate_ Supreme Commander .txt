In the video game series Supreme Commander, humanity has constructed jumpgates called Quantum Gates, which allows instant travel between planets. A vehicle (in almost all cases an ACU, Armoured Command Unit) can enter a Quantum Gate and appear at a different gate or at a position on a planet. This is the way humans wage war in this future.
