While most cinematic films have a broad theatrical release in multiple locations through normal distribution channels, some of the longest films are experimental in nature or created for art gallery installations, having never been simultaneously released to multiple screens or intended for mainstream audiences. They may have been shown in venues where audiences were only expected to view a portion of the film during its screening.
