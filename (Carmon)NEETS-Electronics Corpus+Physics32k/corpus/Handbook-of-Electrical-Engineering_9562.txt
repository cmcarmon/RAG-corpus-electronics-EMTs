The  problem  selection  and  scoping  are  critical  to  the  success  of  the  expert  systems  project.  As  with  any
information  systems  project,  the  systems  analysis  stage  is  an  essential  and  crucial  part  of  the  development
process. With expert systems technology, if the problem domain is not carefully selected, then difÔ¨Åculties will
ensue later in the development process.
