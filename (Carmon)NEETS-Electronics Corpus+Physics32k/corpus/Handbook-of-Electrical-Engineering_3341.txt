Electron multiplication: The phenomenon where a high-energy electron strikes a surface and causes addi-
tional electrons to be emitted from the surface. Energy from the incident electron transfers to the other
electrons to cause this. The result is electron gain which is proportional to the incident electron energy.
Extended source: A light source with Ô¨Ånite size where the source size and shape can be determined from the
