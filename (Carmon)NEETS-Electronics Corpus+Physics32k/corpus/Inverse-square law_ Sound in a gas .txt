In acoustics, the sound pressure of a spherical wavefront radiating from a point source decreases by 50% as the distance r is doubled; measured in dB, the decrease is still 6.02 dB, since dB represents an intensity ratio. The pressure ratio (as opposed to power ratio) is not inverse-square, but is inverse-proportional (inverse distance law):




p

∝



1
r





{\displaystyle p\ \propto \ {\frac {1}{r}}\,}

The same is true for the component of particle velocity



v



{\displaystyle v\,}
that is in-phase with the instantaneous sound pressure

{\displaystyle v\ \propto {\frac {1}{r}}\ \,}

In the near field is a quadrature component of the particle velocity that is 90° out of phase with the sound pressure and does not contribute to the time-averaged energy or the intensity of the sound. The sound intensity is the product of the RMS sound pressure and the in-phase component of the RMS particle velocity, both of which are inverse-proportional. Accordingly, the intensity follows an inverse-square behaviour:
