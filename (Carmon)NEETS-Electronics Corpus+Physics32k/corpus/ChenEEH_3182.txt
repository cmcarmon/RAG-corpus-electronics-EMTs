Contamination Flashover Process
The processes that lead to ﬂashover under contaminated con-
ditions have been extensively researched and documented. A
simpliﬁed model, originally developed around 1930, is shown
in Figure 5.5 and is adequate to explain the process. Leakage
current that is promoted on a wet surface in the combined
presence of moisture and contamination initiates surface dis-
charges, often called dry band arcing. The existence of a highly
nonlinear distribution of the applied voltage along the insula-
tor and the insulator shape that has surface areas with widely
differing diameters, contribute signiﬁcantly to the initiation of
surface discharges. Normally, these discharges are self-limiting
and localized to the narrow parts of the insulator. But, under
conditions usually associated with increased contamination
(or a decreased resistance in series with the arc), the discharges
