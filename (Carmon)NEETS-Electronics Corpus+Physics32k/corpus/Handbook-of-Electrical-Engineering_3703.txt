Fundamentals of Magnetic Recording
Although magnetic recording is practiced in a wide variety of formats and serves a wide variety of applications,
the fundamental principles by which it operates are similar in all cases. The fundamental magnetic recording
conﬁguration is illustrated in Fig. 36.9. The recording head consists of a toroidally shaped core of soft magnetic
material with a few turns of conductor around it. The magnetic medium below the head could be either tape
or disk, and the substrate could be either ﬂexible (for tape and ﬂoppy disks) or rigid (for rigid disks). To record
on  the  medium,  current  is  applied  to  the  coil  around  the  core  of  the  head,  causing  the  high-permeability
magnetic core to magnetize. Because of the gap in the recording head, magnetic ﬂux emanates from the head
and penetrates the medium. If the ﬁeld produced by the head is sufﬁcient to overcome the coercive force of
the medium, the medium will be magnetized by the head ﬁeld. Thus, a representation of the current waveform
applied to the head is stored in the magnetization pattern in the medium.
