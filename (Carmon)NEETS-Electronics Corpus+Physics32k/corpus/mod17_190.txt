Selectivity is the degree of distinction made by the receiver between the desired signal and unwanted
signals. You will find the better the ability of the receiver to reject unwanted signals, the better its
selectivity. The degree of selection is determined by the sharpness of resonance to which the frequency-
determining circuits have been engineered and tuned. You usually measure selectivity by taking a series
of sensitivity readings. As you take the readings, you step the input signal along a band of frequencies
above and below the circuit resonance of the receiver; for example, 100 kilohertz below to 100 kilohertz
