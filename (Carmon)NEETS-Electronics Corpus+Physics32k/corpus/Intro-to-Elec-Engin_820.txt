Thomas A. Edison’s work in 1878 on the electric light led to the concept of a centrally located
power station with distributed electric power for lighting in a surrounding area. The opening
of the historic Pearl Street Station in New York City on September 4, 1882, with dc generators
(dynamos) driven by steam engines, marked the beginning of the electric utility industry. Edison’s
dc systems expanded with the development of three-wire 220-V dc systems. But as transmission
distances and loads continued to grow, voltage problems were encountered. With the advent
of William Stanley’s development of a commercially practical transformer in 1885, alternating
current became more attractive than direct current because of the ability to transmit power at high
voltage with corresponding lower current and lower line-voltage drops. The ﬁrst single-phase ac
line (21 km at 4 kV) in the United States operated in 1889 between Oregon City and Portland.
