The last type of limiter to be discussed in this chapter is the DUAL-DIODE LIMITER, shown in 
figure 4-15, view (A). This limiter combines a parallel-negative limiter with negative bias (D1 and B1) 
and a parallel-positive limiter with positive bias (D2 and B2). Parts of both the positive and negative 
alternations are removed in this circuit. Each battery aids the reverse bias of the diode in its circuit; the 
circuit has no current flow with no input signal. When the input signal is below the value of the biasing 
batteries, both D1 and D2 are reverse biased. With D1 and D2 reverse biased, the output follows the 
input. When the input signal becomes more positive than +20 volts (view (B)), D2 conducts and limits the 
output to +20 volts. When the input signal becomes more negative than âˆ’20 volts, D1 conducts and limits 
the output to this, value. When neither diode conducts, the output follows the input waveform.
