Kerr effects: Reﬂected light from a magnetooptic medium can be described by the optical Kerr effects. There
are  three  types  of  Kerr  effects:  polar,  longitudinal,  and  transverse,  depending  on  the  directions  of  the
magnetization with respect to the plane of incidence and the reﬂecting ﬁlm surface.
