The sensitive mechanisms of electric instruments and meters can be influenced by stray magnetic
fields which will cause errors in their readings. Because instrument mechanisms cannot be insulated
against magnetic flux, it is necessary to employ some means of directing the flux around the instrument.
This is accomplished by placing a soft-iron case, called a MAGNETIC SCREEN or SHIELD, about the
instrument. Because the flux is established more readily through the iron (even though the path is longer)
than through the air inside the case, the instrument is effectively shielded, as shown by the watch and soft-
iron shield in figure 1-18.
