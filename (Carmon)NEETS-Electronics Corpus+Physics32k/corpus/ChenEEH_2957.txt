Typically, ï¬‚icker noise will be dominant at lower frequencies
until the corner frequency is reached, above which thermal
noise dominates. For particular devices, shot noise will also
have a contributive effect. As with thermal noise, however,
shot noise is also approximately independent of frequency.
