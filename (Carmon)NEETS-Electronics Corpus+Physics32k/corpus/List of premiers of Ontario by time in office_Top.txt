^* Frank Miller's Progressive Conservative Party won a plurality of seats in the Ontario general election, 1985, but the resulting 33rd Parliament of Ontario passed a motion of no confidence against him less than two months into his mandate, replacing his government with David Peterson's Liberal Party. This table counts the 1985 election as a mandate for Miller.
