HIRs require long exposure to relatively high light levels. The degree of response will depend on the level of light. They are characterised by the fact that they do not follow the law of reciprocity and depend on the rate of photons hitting the leaf surface, as opposed to the total light levels. This means that neither long exposure to dim levels of light nor very bright flashes of light are enough to trigger these responses.
