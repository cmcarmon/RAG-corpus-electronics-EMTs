The DFT computes the Fourier transform at a ﬁnite set of frequencies — samples the true spectrum —
which can lead to aliasing in the time-domain unless we sample suﬃciently fast. The sampling interval here
is 1
for a length-K DFT: faster sampling to avoid aliasing thus requires a longer transform calculation.
K
Since the longest signal among the input, unit-sample response and output is the output, it is that signal’s
duration that determines the transform length. We simply extend the other two signals with zeros (zero-pad)
to compute their DFTs.
