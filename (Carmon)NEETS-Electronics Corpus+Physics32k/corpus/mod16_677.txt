Other plug-in modules available with some oscilloscopes are high-gain, wide-bandwidth amplifiers;
differential amplifiers; spectrum analyzers; physiological monitors; and other specialized units. Therefore,
the dual-trace capability is a function of the type of plug-in unit that is used with some oscilloscopes.
