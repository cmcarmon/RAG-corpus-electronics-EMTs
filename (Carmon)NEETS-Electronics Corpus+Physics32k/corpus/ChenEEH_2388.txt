radiation is called the main lobe or the main beam. The width
of the main beam, deﬁned using the angles of ﬁrst nulls in both
sides of umax, is called the ﬁrst-null beam width (FNBW).
Sometimes it is more useful to deﬁne the beam width using
the angles of half-power radiation relative to the maximum
radiation. The beam width deﬁned in such manner is called the
half-power beam width (HPBW). The lobes of the radiation
pattern in both sides of the main lobe are called the side lobes,
and the maximum level of radiation in the side lobes is called
the side lobe level (SLL). In many applications, it is desirable
to have a sufﬁciently low SLL to minimize unwanted interfer-
ence away from the main lobe of communication. Low SLL
also helps in efﬁcient use of radiated power by using most of
the radiated power in the desired main lobe of communica-
tion. Antennas also often radiate to the direction opposite the
main beam, and the corresponding lobe is called the back lobe.
The level of maximum radiation in the back lobe is called the
back lobe level (BLL). A low BLL may be desirable to minim-
