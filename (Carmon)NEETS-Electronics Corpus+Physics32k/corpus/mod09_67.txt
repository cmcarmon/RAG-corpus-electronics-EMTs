First, note that fr, (the resonant frequency) is that frequency (or point) where the two curves cross. At 
this point, and ONLY this point, XL equals XC. Therefore, the frequency indicated by fr is the one and 
only frequency of resonance. Note the resistance symbol which indicates that at resonance all reactance is 
cancelled and the circuit impedance is effectively purely resistive. Remember, a.c. circuits that are 
resistive have no phase shift between voltage and current. Therefore, at resonance, phase shift is 
cancelled. The phase angle is effectively zero.
