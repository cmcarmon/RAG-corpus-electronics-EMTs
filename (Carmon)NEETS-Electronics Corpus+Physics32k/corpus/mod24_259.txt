In chapter 2, you learned that light travels faster in a material with a lower refractive index.
Therefore, those light rays that travel the longer distance in the lower refractive index parts of the core
travel at a greater average velocity. This means that the rays that travel farther from the fiber's axis will
arrive at each point along the fiber at nearly the same time as the rays that travel close to the fiber's axis.
The decrease in time difference between light rays reduces modal dispersion and increases multimode
graded-index fiber bandwidth. The increased bandwidth allows the use of multimode graded-index fibers
in most applications.
