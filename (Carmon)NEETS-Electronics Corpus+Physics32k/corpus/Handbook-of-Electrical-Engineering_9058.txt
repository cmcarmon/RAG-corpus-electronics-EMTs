Line Impact Printer Technologies
As shown in Table 89.7, there are three distinct technology approaches for line impact printers: (1) fully formed
character, (2) dot band matrix, and (3) shuttle hammer matrix. The Ô¨Årst method dominates in high-end computer
applications. The other two approaches are primarily used with mid-range computer systems.
