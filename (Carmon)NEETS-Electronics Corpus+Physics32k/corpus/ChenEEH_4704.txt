representations at the point or in the region of operation. An
illustration of these operators for a regulator design is given in
Figure 11.1 In general, a pair (M, T ) is desired such that
T ¼ P o M and the diagram in Figure 11.2 commutes. In the
sequel, T is given, and the objective is to ﬁnd and realize a
controller G: Y ! U such that M ¼ G o E, where E: R ! Y ;
in this case, Y is the space of output errors.
