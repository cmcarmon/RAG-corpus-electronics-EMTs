The requirement for power input to an ideal mechanism to equal power output provides a simple way to compute mechanical advantage from the input-output speed ratio of the system.
The power input to a gear train with a torque TA applied to the drive pulley which rotates at an angular velocity of ωA is P=TAωA.
Because the power flow is constant, the torque TB and angular velocity ωB of the output gear must satisfy the relation




P

{\displaystyle P=T_{A}\omega _{A}=T_{B}\omega _{B},\!}

which yields

{\displaystyle MA={\frac {T_{B}}{T_{A}}}={\frac {\omega _{A}}{\omega _{B}}}.}

This shows that for an ideal mechanism the input-output speed ratio equals the mechanical advantage of the system. This applies to all mechanical systems ranging from robots to linkages.
