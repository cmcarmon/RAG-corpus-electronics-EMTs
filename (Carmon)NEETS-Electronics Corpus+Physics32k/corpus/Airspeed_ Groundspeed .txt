Ground speed is the speed of the aircraft relative to the ground, which is the aircraft's true airspeed combined with the speed of the air mass (i.e., wind) in which it is flying. For instance, an aircraft traveling 150 knots TAS in an air mass moving against its direction of flight at 25 knots would experience a headwind of 25 knots and have a groundspeed of 125 knots.
