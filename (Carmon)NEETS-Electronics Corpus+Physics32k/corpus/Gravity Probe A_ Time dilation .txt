Time dilation refers to the expansion or contraction in the rate at which time passes, and was the subject of the Gravity Probe A experiment. Under Einstein's theory of general relativity, matter distorts the surrounding spacetime, so that the space, in particular, gets bent similar to the way a sheet of fabric would bend if a bowling ball was dropped in the middle of the sheet. But the distortion manifest itself in the time direction as well: the time would appear for a distant observer to flow slower in the vicinity of a massive object. For example, the metric, surrounding a spherically symmetric gravitating body, has a smaller coefficient at

closer to the body, which means slower rate of time flow there.
There is a similar time dilation occurrence in the special relativity (which does not deal with neither gravity nor the curved spacetime). Such time dilation appears in the Rindler coordinates, attached to a uniformly accelerating particle in a flat spacetime. Such particle would observe the time passing faster on the side it is accelerating towards and slower on the opposite side. One can see that, as a way the change in the velocity affects the relativity of simultaneity for the particle. The Einstein's equivalence principle generalizes this analogy, stating that the accelerating reference frames are locally indistinguishable from an inertial reference frames with a gravity force acting upon them. In this way, the Gravity Probe A was a test of the equivalence principle, matching the observations in the inertial (in the special relativity) reference frame of the Earth's surface affected by gravity, with the predictions of the special relativity for the same frame treated as being accelerating upwards with respect to free fall reference, which can thought of being inertial and gravityless.
