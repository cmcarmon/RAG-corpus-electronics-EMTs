The matched-ﬁlter receiver provides impressive performance once adequate signal-to-noise ratios occur. You
might wonder whether another receiver might be better. The answer is that the matched-ﬁlter receiver is
optimal: No other receiver can provide a smaller probability of error than the matched ﬁlter
regardless of the SNR. Furthermore, no signal set can provide better performance than the BPSK signal
set, where the signal representing a bit is the negative of the signal representing the other bit. The reason
for this result rests in the dependence of probability of error pe on the diﬀerence between the noise-free
integrator outputs: For a given Eb, no other signal set provides a greater diﬀerence.
