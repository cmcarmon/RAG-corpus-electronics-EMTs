By increasing the value of R4, you can limit the current to almost any value. For example, a 100-
ohm resistor develops a voltage drop of 0.6 volt at 6 milliamperes of current. You may encounter 
current-limiting circuits that are more sophisticated, but the theory of operation is always the same. If you 
understand this circuit, you should have no problem with the others.
