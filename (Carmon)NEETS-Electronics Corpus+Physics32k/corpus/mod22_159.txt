The last kind of memory we will briefly introduce here is called secondary storage or auxiliary 
storage. This is memory outside the main body of the computer (cpu) where we store programs and data 
for future use. When the computer is ready to use these programs and data, they are read into internal 
storage. Secondary (auxiliary) storage media extends the storage capabilities of the computer system. We 
need it for two reasons. First, because the computer's internal storage is limited in size, it cannot always 
hold all the data we need. Second, in secondary storage, data and programs do not disappear when power 
is turned off. Secondary storage is nonvolatile. This means information is lost only if you, the user, 
intentionally erase it. The three types of secondary storage we most commonly use are magnetic disk, 
tape, and drum.
