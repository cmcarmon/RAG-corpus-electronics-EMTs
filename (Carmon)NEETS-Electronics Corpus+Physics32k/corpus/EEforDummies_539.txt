▶✓ P‐type semiconductors have fewer electrons, leaving holes in the crys­
talline structure where the electrons used to be. Holes don’t stay still 
long because neighboring electrons tend to occupy them, leaving new 
holes elsewhere, which are quickly occupied by more electrons, leaving 
more holes, and so on. The net result is that these holes appear to be 
moving within the crystal. Because holes represent an absence of elec­
trons, you can think of them as positive charges. P‐types are so named 
because of these positive charge carriers.
