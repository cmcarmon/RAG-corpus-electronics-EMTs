Another  aspect  of  the  problem  is  that  many  integrated  optic  devices  require  a  single,  well-deﬁned  linearly
polarized input. Ordinary single-mode ﬁber is not suitable in this case. The solution is to use polarization preserving
ﬁber. This ﬁber is made such that it will maintain a single linearly polarized input over long distances. The use of
polarization preserving ﬁber, however, adds another requirement to the coupling problem. This requirement is that
the ﬁber must be rotationally aligned about its cylindrical axis so that the linearly polarized light coincides with the
desired rotational axis of the LiNbO3 waveguide. The rotational precision needed is <0.5 degrees.
