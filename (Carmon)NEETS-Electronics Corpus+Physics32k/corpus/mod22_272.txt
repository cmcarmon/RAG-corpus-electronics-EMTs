Included in the requirements are an input file description, the report heading information lines, the 
input data record fields, the calculations to be done, and the data fields to be printed and summarized. The 
RPG program takes this information and generates a program for the specific problem. You then run that 
program with the specified input data file to produce the printed report. The input data file must be in the 
sequence in which you want the report to summarize the data.
