When using a JFET as a VVR, it is necessary to limit VDS to values that are small compared to VP to maintain
good  linearity.  In  addition  VGS  should  preferably  not  exceed  0.8 VP  for  good  linearity,  control,  and  stability.
This limitation corresponds to an rds resistance ratio of about 10:1. As  VGS approaches VP , a small change in
VP can produce a large change in rds. Thus unit-to-unit variations in VP as well as changes in VP with temperature
can result in large changes in rds as VGS approaches VP .
