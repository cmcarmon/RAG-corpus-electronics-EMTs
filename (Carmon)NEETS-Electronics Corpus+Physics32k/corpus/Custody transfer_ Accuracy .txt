In the ISO 5725-1 standard accuracy for measuring instruments is defined as “the closeness of agreement between a test result and the accepted reference value”. This term “accuracy” includes both the systematic error and the bias component. Each device has its manufacturer stated accuracy specification and its tested accuracy. Uncertainty takes all the metering system factors that impact measurement accuracy into account. The accuracy of flowmeters could be used in two different metering systems that ultimately have different calculated uncertainties due to other factors in the system that affect flow calculations. Uncertainty even includes such factors as the flow computer's A/D converter accuracy. The quest for accuracy in a custody transfer system requires meticulous attention to detail.
