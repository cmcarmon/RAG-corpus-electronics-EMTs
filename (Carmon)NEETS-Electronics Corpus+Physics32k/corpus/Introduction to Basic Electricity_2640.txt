Capacitive reactance is the opposition to changes in the 
applied AC voltage by a capacitor. In an AC  circuit, a 
capacitor is thus an effective way of controlling  current. 
Using Ohmâ€™s law, the current is directly  proportional to 
the applied voltage and inversely proportional to the 
capacitive reactance. This is expressed as:
