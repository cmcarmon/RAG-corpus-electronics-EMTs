A simple CW transmitter and receiver 
 
Figure  13.4  shows  a  simple  radio  communication 
system comprising a transmitter and receiver for 
use  with  continuous  wave 
signals. 
Communication  is  achieved  by  simply  switching 
(or ‘keying’) the radio frequency signal on and off. 
Keying can be achieved by interrupting the supply 
to the power amplifier stage or even the oscillator 
stage  however  it  is  normally  applied  within  the 
driver stage that operates at a more  modest power
