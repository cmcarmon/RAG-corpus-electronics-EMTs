A short circuit is at the opposite extreme. It is an element across which no
voltage can appear regardless of the current through it. It behaves like a linear
resistor in the limit R â†’ 0. Observe that the short circuit element is the same
as an ideal wire. Note that neither the open circuit nor the short circuit dissipate
power since the product of their terminal variables (v and i) is identically zero.
Most often, resistances are thought of as time-invariant parameters. But if
the temperature of a resistor changes, then so too can its resistance. Thus, a
linear resistor can be a time-varying element.
