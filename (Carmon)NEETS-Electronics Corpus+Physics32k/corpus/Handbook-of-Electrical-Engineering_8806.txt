Since their carrier sets are ordered (one of the operations of these types is £), these types are also called scalar
types. All provide operations for comparing values; in addition, Integer and Real come equipped with the usual
arithmetic operations (+, –, *, /) and Boolean with the basic logical operations (not, and, or). Most computers
support these operations by hardware instructions. Thus, while bit arrays are the original native objects of a
digital computer, the fundamental scalar types may be viewed as the given elementary building blocks for the
construction of all other types.
