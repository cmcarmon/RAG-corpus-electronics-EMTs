When the valve is closed slowly compared to the transit time for a pressure wave to travel the length of the pipe, the elasticity can be neglected, and the phenomenon can be described in terms of inertance or rigid column theory:




F
=
m
a
=
P
A
=
ρ
L
A



d
v


d
t



.


{\displaystyle F=ma=PA=\rho LA{dv \over dt}.}

Assuming constant deceleration of the water column (dv/dt = v/t), gives:




P
=
ρ
L
v

/

t
.


{\displaystyle P=\rho Lv/t.}

where:
F = force, N
m = mass of the fluid column, kg
a = acceleration, m/s2
P = pressure, Pa
A = pipe cross section, m2
ρ = fluid density, kg/m3
L = pipe length, m
v = flow velocity, m/s
t = valve closure time, s
The above formula becomes, for water and with imperial unit: P = 0.0135 V L/t. For practical application, a safety factor of about 5 is recommended:




P
=
0.07
V

P

{\displaystyle P=0.07VL/t+P_{1}}

where P1 is the inlet pressure in psi, V is the flow velocity in ft/sec, t is the valve closing time in seconds and L is the upstream pipe length in feet.
