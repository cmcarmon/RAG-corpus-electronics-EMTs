The dynamics of the Rulkov map can be analyzed by analyzing the dynamics of its one dimensional fast submap. Since the variable



y


{\displaystyle y}
evolves very slowly, for moderate amount of time it can be treated as a parameter with constant value in the



x


{\displaystyle x}
variable's evolution equation (which we now call as one dimensional fast submap because as compared to



y


{\displaystyle y}
,



x


{\displaystyle x}
is a fast variable). Depending on the value of



y


{\displaystyle y}
, this submap can have either one or three fixed points. One of these fixed points is stable, another is unstable and third may change the stability. As



y


{\displaystyle y}
increases, two of these fixed points (stable one and unstable one) merge and disappear by saddle-node bifurcation.
