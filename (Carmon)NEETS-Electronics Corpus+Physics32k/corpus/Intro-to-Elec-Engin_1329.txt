Figure 14.2.8(a) shows a simple FDM system which is used in telephone communication
systems. Each input is passed through a low-pass ﬁlter (LPF) so that all frequency components
above 3 kHz are eliminated. It is then modulated onto individual subcarriers with 4-kHz spacing.
While all subcarriers are synthesized from a master oscillator, the modulation is achieved with
single sideband (SSB). The multiplexed signal, with a typical spectrum as shown in Figure
14.2.8(b), is formed by summing the SSB signals and a 60-kHz pilot carrier. The bandpass ﬁlters
(BPFs) at the destination separate each SSB signal for product demodulation. Synchronization is
achieved by obtaining the local oscillator waveforms from the pilot carrier. Telephone signals are
often multiplexed in this fashion.
