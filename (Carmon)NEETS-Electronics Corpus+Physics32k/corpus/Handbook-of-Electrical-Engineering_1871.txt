SIMD architectures provide a high degree of parallelism at high speeds. Instruction distribution and decoding
is not a bottleneck. Furthermore, each processing element has its own data registers and the communication
network  between  the  processing  elements  can  be  designed  to  be  fast.  However,  not  all  algorithms  can  be
efﬁciently  mapped  onto  SIMD  architectures.  Global  computation  is  difﬁcult  in  SIMD  machines.  Operations
that cause global changes to the machine state also create problems.
