Systems for all aspects of SMT assembly are available to support low-volume/prototype needs. These systems
will  typically  have  manual  solder-paste  deposition  and  parts  placement  systems,  with  these  functions  being
assisted for the user. Syringe solder paste deposition may be as simple as a manual medical-type syringe dispenser
which must be guided and squeezed freehand. More sophisticated systems will have the syringe mounted on
an X–Y arm to carry the weight of the syringe, and will apply air pressure to the top of the syringe with a foot-
pedal  control,  freeing  the  operator’s  arm  to  guide  the  syringe  to  the  proper  location  on  the  substrate  and
perform  the  negative  z-axis  maneuver  which  will  bring  the  syringe  tip  into  the  proper  location  and  height
above the substrate. Dispensing is then accomplished by a timed air pressure burst applied to the top of the
syringe under foot-pedal control. Paste volume is likewise determined by trial-and-error with the time/pressure
relation and depends on the type and manufacturer of paste being dispensed.
