The Single-Amplifier Biquad On occasion, considerations of
cost and power consumption necessitate using a single op-amp
per second-order section. In that case, the single-ampliÔ¨Åer
biquad (SAB) of Figure 4.8 may be used. Depending on the
choice of components, the circuit can realize a variety of, but
not all, different transfer functions. The function realized by
this circuit is written as:
