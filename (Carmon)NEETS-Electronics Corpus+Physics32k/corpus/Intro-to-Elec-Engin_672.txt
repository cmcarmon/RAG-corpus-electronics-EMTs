It is the active region beyond pinch-off that is useful for the controlled-source operation, since
only changes in vGS will produce changes in iD. Figure 7.4.3 illustrates the JFET characteristics.
Part (a) shows the idealized static characteristics with two regions separated by the dashed line,
indicating the ohmic (controlled-resistance or triode) region and the active (controlled-source)
region beyond pinch-off. Note that iD is initially proportional to vDS in the ohmic region where
the JFET behaves much like a voltage-variable resistance; iD depends on vGS for a given value
of vDS in the active region. In a practical JFET, however, the curves of iD versus vDS are not
entirely ﬂat in the active region but tend to increase slightly with vDS, as shown in Figure 7.4.3(b);
when extended, these curves tend to intersect at a point of −VA on the vDS axis. Another useful
characteristic indicating the strength of the controlled source is the transfer characteristic, relating
the drain current iD to the degree of the negative bias vGS applied between gate and source; a cutoff
region exists, indicated by the pinch-off voltage −VP , for which no drain current ﬂows, because
both vGS and vDS act to eliminate the conducting channel completely.
