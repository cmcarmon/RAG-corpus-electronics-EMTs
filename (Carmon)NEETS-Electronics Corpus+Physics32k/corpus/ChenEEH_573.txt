For higher current or voltage-handling capability, devices
can be connected in parallel or series. Connecting BJTs in
parallel can lead to instabilities because of a negative tempera-
ture coefÔ¨Åcient of the on-state resistance. During conduction,
if the temperature of one device rises, its resistance reduces,
causing it to pass more current than other transistors. This, in
turn, leads to a further rise in current, eventually resulting in a
thermal runaway condition that destroys the device.
