The Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics (Albert Einstein Institute) is a Max Planck Institute whose research is aimed at investigating Einsteinâ€™s theory of relativity and beyond: Mathematics, quantum gravity, astrophysical relativity, and gravitational wave astronomy. The Institute was founded in 1995 and is located in Golm, Potsdam (theoretical branch) and in Hannover (experimental branch).
The institute is involved in a number of collaborations and projects: The experimental branch is a main partner in the gravitational wave detector GEO 600; institute scientists are involved in analyzing data for the detectors of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration and in planning and preparing the space-based detector LISA. The institute is also a major player in the Einstein@Home and PyCBC projects.
Since 1998, the institute has published the open access review journal Living Reviews in Relativity.
