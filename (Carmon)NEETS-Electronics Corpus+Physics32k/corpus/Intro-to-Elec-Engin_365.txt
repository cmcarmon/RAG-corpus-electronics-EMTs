The best possible shock protection is afforded by the ground-fault circuit interrupter (GFCI)
shown in Figure 4.4.4(c). A sensing coil located around the “hot” and neutral wires in the GFCI
detects the imbalance of currents between the neutral and the live conductor under fault conditions
and opens the circuit in response when |IB − IW| > 5 mA. The GFCI may be located either at
an outlet or at the main panel. Ground-fault interrupters are now required in branch circuits that
serve outlets in areas such as bathrooms, basements, garages, and outdoor sites.
