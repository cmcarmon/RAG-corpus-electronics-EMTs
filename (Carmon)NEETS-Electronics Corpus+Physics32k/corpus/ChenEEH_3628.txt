The most straightforward way to implement digital ﬁlters
relies on general purpose computers by programming their
central processing units (CPUs) to execute the operations
related to a particular digital ﬁlter structure. This type of
implementation is very ﬂexible because it consists of writing
software, allowing fast prototyping and testing. This solution,
however, might not be acceptable in applications requiring
high-processing speed, fast data input/output interfaces, or
large-scale production.
