Triacs 
 
Triacs are a refinement of the thyristor which, when 
triggered,  conduct  on  both  positive  and  negative 
half-cycles of the applied voltage. Triacs have three 
terminals known as main terminal one (MT1), main 
terminal two (MT2) and gate (G), as shown in Fig. 
5.14. Triacs can be triggered by both positive and 
negative voltages applied between G and MT1 with 
positive  and  negative  voltages  present  at  MT2 
respectively. Triacs thus provide full-wave control 
and  offer  superior  performance  in  a.c.  power 
control applications when compared with thyristors

Table  5.5  summarizes  the  characteristics  of 
several  common  triacs.  In  order  to  simplify  the 
design of triggering circuits, triacs are often used in 
conjunction  with  diacs  (equivalent 
to  a  bi-
directional  zener  diode).  A  typical  diac  conducts 
heavily  when 
the  applied  voltage  exceeds 
approximately 30 V in either direction. Once in the 
conducting state, the resistance of the diac falls to a 
very low value and thus a relatively large value of 
current  will  flow.  The  characteristic  of  a  typical 
diac is shown in Fig. 5.15.
