One challenge in photonic network design is to make them “all-optical,” as nearly as possible, in order to
avoid  throughput  bottlenecks  by  electronic  components  and  the  expense  of  O/E  and  E/O  conversions.  In
principle, clear all-optical channels would offer connectivity independent of data-rate and format for a wide
variety  of  applications.  However,  many  physical  technology  problems  remain  and  new  concepts  for  multple
access and congestion control [Special Issue, 1991] suited to large bit-rate-delay (M) systems must be found.
