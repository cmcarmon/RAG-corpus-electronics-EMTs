reducing it to a single resistance. Then, we would take that equivalent resistance (R2//R3) and
the one in series with it (R4), reducing them to another equivalent resistance (R2//R3−−R4).
Next, we would proceed to calculate the parallel equivalent of that resistance (R2//R3−−R4)
with R5, then in series with R7, then in parallel with R6, then in series with R1 to give us a
grand total resistance for the circuit as a whole.
