Knowledge (e.g., ARDEN SYNTAX)
The ARDEN SYNTAX is a standard for sharing medical knowledge bases in the form of medical logic modules
(MLM). Its structure is derived from the HELP (LDS Hospital) and the CARE (Regenstrief MC) systems. The
MLMs accommodate alerts, management critiques, therapy suggestions, diagnosis scoring, etc. Each MLM is
limited to the knowledge to make a single decision.
