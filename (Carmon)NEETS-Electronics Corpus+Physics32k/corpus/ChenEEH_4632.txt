In both the continuous, and discrete gain-scheduling
designs, stability and performance of
the gain-scheduled
system can, in general, only be guaranteed in a neighborhood
of the current operating condition. Speciﬁcally, the gain-
scheduled design is not guaranteed stable or guaranteed to
exhibit desired performance properties for all u 2 Q, or for
all u 2 F Q. It is the latter of these two conditions that is the
most difﬁcult to guarantee. Further assurances of stability and
performance must be derived from extensive simulation and
testing. Successful designs typically involve scheduling on a
slowly changing variable that captures the nonlinear behavior
of the plant.
