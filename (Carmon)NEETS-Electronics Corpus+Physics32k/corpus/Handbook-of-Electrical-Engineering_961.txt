Our  recommended  approach  is  to  ﬁt  subsets  of  relevant  parameters  to  corresponding  subsets  of  relevant
data in a way that makes physical sense. For example, in the MOS level 3 model, VT0 is deﬁned as the threshold
voltage of a long, wide transistor at zero back-bias. It does not make sense to use this parameter to ﬁt to a short
channel  transistor,  or  to  ﬁt  at  nonzero  back-bias  values,  or  to  ﬁt  to  anywhere  outside  the  linear  region.  In
addition, subsets of parameters should be obtained in the proper order so that those obtained at a later step
do not affect those obtained at earlier steps. That is, we would not obtain saturation region parameters before
we have obtained linear region parameters because the values of the linear region parameters would inﬂuence
the saturation region ﬁts; we would have to go back and reoptimize on the saturation region parameters after
obtaining the linear region parameters. Finally, never use optimization to obtain a parameter value when the
parameter can be measured directly. For example, the MOS oxide thickness, TOX, is a model parameter, but
we would never use optimization to ﬁnd it. Always measure its value directly on a large oxide capacitor provided
on the test chip. The recommended procedure for proper device characterization follows:
