More accurate for the first round and for semi automatic fire:
No movement of heavy working parts prior to firing to potentially inhibit accuracy.
Round sits consistently in the chamber.
Potentially shorter delay between operator pulling the trigger and round being fired (also known as lock time).

Cleaner operation - less potential for dust and other foreign debris to enter the gun, since the action remains closed unless the weapon is firing.
Action can be locked forward to further reduce noise in a suppressed weapon.
Can carry an additional round in the chamber, increasing ammunition capacity to one beyond the magazine's limit.
