Computing environments provided by many software tools and packages allow users to design, simulate, and
implement  digital  signal  processing  (DSP)  techniques  with  speed,  accuracy,  and  conﬁdence.  With  access  to
libraries of high-performance algorithms and to advanced visualization capabilities, we can design and analyze
systems using the equations and notations that we use to think about signal processing problems; we do not
have  to  translate  the  equations  and  techniques  into  a  different  notation  and  syntax.  The  graphics  interface
provides an integral part of this design environment, and is accessible from any point within our algorithms.
Within this type of computing environment, we are more productive. But, even more important, we develop
“what
better solutions because we have so many more tools for analyzing solutions, for experimenting with 
if” questions
, and for developing extensive simulations to test our solutions. To illustrate the power of these
environments,  we  present  a  brief  description  of  MATLAB,  one  of  the  most  popular  technical  computing
environments in both industry and academia, and then present three examples that use MATLAB.
