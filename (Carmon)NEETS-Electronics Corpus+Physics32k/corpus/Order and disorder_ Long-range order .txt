Long-range order characterizes physical systems in which remote portions of the same sample exhibit correlated behavior.
This can be expressed as a correlation function, namely the spin-spin correlation function:




G
(
x
,

x
′

)
=
⟨
s
(
x
)
,
s
(

x
′

)
⟩
.



{\displaystyle G(x,x')=\langle s(x),s(x')\rangle .\,}

where s is the spin quantum number and x is the distance function within the particular system.
This function is equal to unity when



x
=

x
′



{\displaystyle x=x'}
and decreases as the distance

{\displaystyle |x-x'|}
increases. Typically, it decays exponentially to zero at large distances, and the system is considered to be disordered. If, however, the correlation function decays to a constant value at large

x

|



{\displaystyle |x-x'|}
then the system is said to possess long-range order. If it decays to zero as a power of the distance then it is called quasi-long-range order (for details see Chapter 11 in the textbook cited below. See also Berezinskii–Kosterlitz–Thouless transition). Note that what constitutes a large value of
