In recent years a mammalian two hybrid (M2H) system has been designed to study mammalian protein-protein interactions in a cellular environment that closely mimics the native protein environment  Transiently transfected mammalian cells are used in this system to find protein-protein interactions. Using a mammalian cell line to study mammalian protein-protein interactions gives the advantage of working in a more native context. The post-translational modifications, phosphorylation, acylation and glycosylation are similar. The intracellular localization of the proteins is also more correct compared to using a yeast two hybrid system.  It is also possible with the mammalian two-hybrid system to study signal inputs. Another big advantage is that results can be obtained within 48 hours after transfection.
