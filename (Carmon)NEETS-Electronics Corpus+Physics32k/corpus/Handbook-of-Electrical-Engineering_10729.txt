that process the measurements made by each sensor (e.g., inertial or air data). It contains calibration constants,
initialization  sequences,  self-test  algorithms,  reasonability  tests,  and  alternative  algorithms  for  periods  when
sensors  have  failed  or  are  not  receiving  information.  In  the  simplest  systems,  the  state  vector  is  calculated
independently  from  each  sensor;  most  often,  the  navigation  software  contains  multisensor  algorithms  that
calculate the best estimate of position and velocity from several sensors. Prior to 1970, the best estimate was
calculated from a least squares algorithm with constant weighting functions or from a frequency-domain ﬁlter
 calculates the best estimate from mathematical models of the
with constant coefﬁcients. Now, a 
dynamics of each sensor.
