A pair of inductors can be seen on this circuit board, to the right and center, appearing
as small black chips with the number ”100” printed on both. The upper inductor’s label can
be seen printed on the green circuit board as L5. Of course these inductors are very small in
inductance value, but it demonstrates just how tiny they can be manufactured to meet certain
circuit design needs.
