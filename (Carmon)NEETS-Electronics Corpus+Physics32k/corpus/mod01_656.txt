Figure 3-64 is used to illustrate the development of a simple voltage divider. The requirement for
this voltage divider is to provide a voltage of 25 volts and a current of 910 milliamps to the load from a
source voltage of 100 volts. Figure 3-64(A) provides a circuit in which 25 volts is available at point B. If
the load was connected between point B and ground, you might think that the load would be supplied
with 25 volts. This is not true since the load connected between point B and ground forms a parallel
network of the load and resistor R1. (Remember that the value of resistance of a parallel network is
always less than the value of the smallest resistor in the network.)
