If you hear the word “ground” used in an elec-
tronics context, be aware that ground can refer 
to either earth ground or common ground.
Earth ground means pretty much what it says: 
It’s a direct connection to the ground — real 
ground, the stuff of the planet. The screw in the 
center of a standard two‐prong AC outlet, as 
well as the third prong in a three‐prong outlet, 
is connected to earth ground. Behind each wall 
socket is a wire that runs through your house 
or office and eventually connects to a metal 
post that makes good contact with the ground. 
This arrangement provides extra protection for 
circuits that use large amounts of current; in 
the event of a short circuit or other hazardous 
condition, shipping dangerous current directly 
into the earth gives it a safe place to go. Such 
was the case when Ben Franklin’s lightning rod 
provided a direct path for dangerous lightning 
to travel along on its way into the ground — 
instead of via a house or a person.
In  circuits  that  handle  large  currents,  some 
point in the circuit is usually connected to a
