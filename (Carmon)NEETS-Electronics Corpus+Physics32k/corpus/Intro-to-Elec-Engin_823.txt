Other types of electric power generation are also prevalent, accounting for about 1% of
U.S. generation. These include wind-turbine generators, solar-cell arrays, tidal power plants, and
geothermal power plants, wherein energy in the form of steam or hot water is extracted from the
earthâ€™s upper crust. Substantial research now under way shows nuclear fusion energy to be the
most promising technology for producing safe, pollution-free, and economical electric energy in
this century and beyond, since the needed fuel (deuterium) consumed in a nuclear fusion reaction
is present in seawater abundantly.
