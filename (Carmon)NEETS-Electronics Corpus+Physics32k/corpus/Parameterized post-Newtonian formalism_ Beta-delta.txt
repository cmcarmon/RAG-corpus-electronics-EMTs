Ten post-Newtonian parameters completely characterize the weak-field behavior of the theory. The formalism has been a valuable tool in tests of general relativity. In the notation of Will (1971), Ni (1972) and Misner et al. (1973) they have the following values:





g

μ
ν




{\displaystyle g_{\mu \nu }}
is the 4 by 4 symmetric metric tensor with indexes



μ


{\displaystyle \mu }
and



ν


{\displaystyle \nu }
going from 0 to 3. Below, an index of 0 will indicate the time direction and indices



i


{\displaystyle i}
and



j


{\displaystyle j}
(going from 1 to 3) will indicate spatial directions.
In Einstein's theory, the values of these parameters are chosen (1) to fit Newton's Law of gravity in the limit of velocities and mass approaching zero, (2) to ensure conservation of energy, mass, momentum, and angular momentum, and (3) to make the equations independent of the reference frame. In this notation, general relativity has PPN parameters
