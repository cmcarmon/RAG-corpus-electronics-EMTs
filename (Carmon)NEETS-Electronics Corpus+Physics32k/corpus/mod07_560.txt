Tracing the ac signal through the equipment is the most rapid and accurate method of locating a 
trouble that cannot be found by a visual check, and it also serves as check on any repairs you may have 
made. The idea is to trace the ac voltage from the transformer, to see it change to pulsating dc at the 
rectifier output, and then see the pulsations smoothed out by the filter. The point where the signal stops or 
becomes distorted is the place look for the trouble. If you have no dc output voltage, you should look for 
an open or a short in your signal tracing. If you have a low dc voltage, you should look for a defective 
part and keep your eyes open for the place where the signal becomes distorted.
