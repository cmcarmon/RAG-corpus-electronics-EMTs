Figure 18-14 shows a loop of wire (conductor) 
 being rotated (moved) in a magnetic field. The loop 
has a light and dark side for ease of explanation. At the 
point shown in part A, the dark half is parallel to the 
lines of force, as is the light half. No voltage is induced. 
As the loop is rotated toward the position shown in 
part B, the lines of force are cut and a voltage is in-
duced. The induced voltage is greatest at this position, 
when the motion is at right angles to the magnetic 
field. As the loop is rotated to position C, fewer lines 
of force are cut and the induced voltage decreases from 
the maximum value to zero volts. At this point, the 
loop has rotated 180ยบ, or half a circle.
