This example has been designed as a simpliﬁed analysis of a
carrier phase differential global positioning system-aided INS.
A full error analysis is signiﬁcantly more complicated for a few
reasons. First, the INS equations are nonlinear. The implemen-
tation therefore requires a more advanced estimator imple-
mentation, such as an extended Kalman ﬁlter. Second, the INS
error equations are functions of the acceleration and angular
rate of the inertial measurement unit. In addition, the linear-
ized measurement matrix is a function of the satellite positions
and is therefore time varying. Therefore, the state-space model
is time varying, and the full error analysis would be dependent
on assumed vehicle maneuvers and satellite conﬁgurations.
