Fiber optics appears to be the future method of choice for many communications applications. The biggest
advantage  of  a  lightwave  system  is  its  tremendous  information-carrying  capacity.  There  are  already  systems
that can carry several thousand simultaneous conversations over a pair of optical Ô¨Åbers thinner than human
hair.  In  addition  to  this  extremely  high  capacity,  the  lightguide  cables  are  light  weight,  they  are  immune  to
electromagnetic interference, and they are potentially very inexpensive.
