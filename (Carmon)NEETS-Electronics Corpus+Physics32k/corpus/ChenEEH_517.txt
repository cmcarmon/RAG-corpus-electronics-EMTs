An acceptor atom has fewer electrons than are needed for
chemical bonds with neighboring atoms of the host semicon-
ductor. For example, a boron atom has only three electrons
available for bonding. Hence, when a boron atom replaces a
silicon atom in silicon, it ‘‘accepts’’ one missing electron from
the valence band, creating a hole.
