Most operational amplifiers have open-loop voltage 
gains of 90 dB, or more. 
 
Closed-loop voltage gain 
 
The  closed-loop  voltage  gain  of  an  operational 
amplifier is defined as the ratio of output voltage to 
input voltage measured with a small proportion of 
the output fed back to the input (i.e. with feedback
