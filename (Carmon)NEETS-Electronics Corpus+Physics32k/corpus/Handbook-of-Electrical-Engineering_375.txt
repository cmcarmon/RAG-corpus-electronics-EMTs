Perhaps a better form for visualizing the voltages and currents is a graphical one. Phasor diagrams for the
voltages separately and the currents separately are shown in Fig. 3.29. The value of angle b1 will depend on the
load. An interesting result is clear from these diagrams. First, V2 and V3 are each otherâ€™s conjugates. So if we
add them, the imaginary parts cancel and the sum will be real, as illustrated by the construction in the voltage
diagram. Furthermore, the construction shows that this real part is negative and equal in size to V1. Hence, the
sum  of  the  three  voltages  is  zero.  The  same  is  true  of  the  sum  of  the  three  currents,  as  can  be  established
graphically by a similar construction.
