While the Fourier transform approach is mathematically straightforward, many commercial scanners utilize
the equivalent but more easily implemented back-projection/deconvolution approach, where each ray is traced
back along its propagation axis. When all rays have been back-projected and the result summed, one obtains
an approximate (blurred) image of that plane. This image can then be sharpened (deblurred) through the use
of  an  appropriate  Ô¨Ålter,  which  is  usually  implemented  by  convolving  with  an  appropriate  two-dimensional
deblurring function. Refer to Macovski [1983] for the details of this process.
