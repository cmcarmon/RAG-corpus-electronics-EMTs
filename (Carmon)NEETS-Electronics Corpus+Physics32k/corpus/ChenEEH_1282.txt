Magnetic Disk Memory
Magnetic disk memory is used to implement hard disks,
standard ﬂoppy disks, and high-density ﬂoppy disks (e.g.,
Zip drive, Super drive). Hard disks are the most commonly
used second memory devices because of their low cost, high
speed, and high storage capacity. Hard disk drives are mass
storage units that allow read to and write from magnetic
media; they consist of one or many thin disks that have
magnetic coating, allowing data to be recorded. The recording
surface is divided into concentric tracks, and each track is
divided into segments called sectors. The set of tracks at a
given radial position is referred to as a cylinder. One disk or
more are then mount on a spindle and rotate at a constant
speed. To access the data, a two-step process is required. First,
the read/write head moves across the rotating disk to the
locating track. Then the head waits until the right sector is
underneath it, and read/write is performed. The descriptions
of magnetic disk memory devices are given as follows:
