Figures 21-7 through 21-9 show three of the  basic 
nonsinusoidal waveforms. These waveforms can rep-
resent either current or voltage. Figure 21-7 shows a 
squareâ€‚wave, so designated because its positive and 
negative alternations are square in shape. This indi-
cates that the current or voltage immediately reaches 
its maximum value and remains there for the dura-
tion of the alternation. When the polarity changes, the 
current or voltage immediately reaches the opposite
