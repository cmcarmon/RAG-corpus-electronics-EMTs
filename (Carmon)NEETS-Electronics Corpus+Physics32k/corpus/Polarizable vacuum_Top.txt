Gravitation can be described via a scalar theory of gravitation, using a stratified conformally flat metric, in which the field equation arises from the notion that the vacuum behaves like an optical polarizable medium. It was proposed by R. H. Dicke (1957) and then H. E. Puthoff (1998). Harold Puthoff (see also Bernard Haisch and SED)

In theoretical physics, polarizable vacuum (PV) and its associated theory refers to proposals by Harold Puthoff, Robert H. Dicke, and others to develop an analogue of general relativity to describe gravity  and its relationship to electromagnetism.
