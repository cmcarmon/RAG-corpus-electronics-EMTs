The factors that affect the design of the primary system
include the cost, importance of the load it serves, and the
required level of service continuity and reliability. The simplest
and least expensive and, therefore, the most common design is
radial design. The low reliability of this design is improved by
a modiÔ¨Åcation called the loop-type primary design, in which
the feeder loops through the feeder load area and returns to the
substation bus. The most expensive and reliable design is the
primary-network type, in which a system of interconnected
feeders is supplied by a number of substations. Such a system
supplies a load from several directions and consequently pro-
vides the maximum reliability and quality of service.
