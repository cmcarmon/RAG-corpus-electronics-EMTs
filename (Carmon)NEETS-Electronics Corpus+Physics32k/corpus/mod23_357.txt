Telemetry digital magnetic tape recorders are more commonly called wideband recorders. They’re
used for recording radar signals and other pulsed square-wave type signals with a bandwidth of 500 kHz
to 2 MHz. They’re also multi-tracked tape recorders that have either 14 or 28 tracks for data. They use 1"
magnetic tape on either aluminum or glass reels.
