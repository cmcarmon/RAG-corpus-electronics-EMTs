Two of the most common A/D conversion processes are successive approximation A/D conversion and parallel
or ï¬‚ash A/D conversion. Very high-resolution digital audio or video systems require specialized A/D techniques
that often incorporate one of these general techniques as well as specialized A/D conversion processes. Examples
