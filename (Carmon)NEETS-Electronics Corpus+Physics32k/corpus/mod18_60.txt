AMBIGUOUS RETURNS.â€”The radar timing system must be reset to zero each time a pulse is
radiated. This is to ensure that the range detected is measured from time zero each time. The prt of the
radar becomes important in maximum range determination because target return times that exceed the prt
of the radar system appear at incorrect locations (ranges) on the radar screen. Returns that appear at these
incorrect ranges are referred to as AMBIGUOUS RETURNS or SECOND-SWEEP ECHOES.
