Rosin Mildly Activated (RMA) is the old standard, and if cleaning is needed with RMA, either solvent-based
cleaners or water with saponiﬁers must be used. (Saponiﬁers are alkaline materials that react with the rosin so
that it becomes water-soluble.) RMA tends to be non-active at “room” temperatures, and may not need to be
cleaned on commercial products designed for indoor use. The major limitation on RMA at this point is the
need for chemicals in the cleaning process.
