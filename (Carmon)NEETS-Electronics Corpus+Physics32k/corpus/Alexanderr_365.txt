As usual, we analyze op amp circuits using nodal analysis. Some-
times, the Thevenin equivalent circuit is used to reduce the op amp cir-
cuit  to  one  that  we  can  easily  handle.  The  following  three  examples
illustrate  the  concepts.  The  Ô¨Årst  one  deals  with  a  source-free  op  amp
circuit, while the other two involve step responses. The three examples
have been carefully selected to cover all possible RC types of op amp
circuits, depending on the location of the capacitor with respect to the
op  amp;  that  is,  the  capacitor  can  be  located  in  the  input,  the  output,
or the feedback loop.
