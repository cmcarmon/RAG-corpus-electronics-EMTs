In physics, the Rayleigh dissipation function, named for Lord Rayleigh, is a function used to handle the effects of velocity-proportional frictional forces in Lagrangian mechanics. It is defined for a system of

particles as

{\displaystyle F={\frac {1}{2}}\sum _{i=1}^{N}(k_{x}v_{i,x}^{2}+k_{y}v_{i,y}^{2}+k_{z}v_{i,z}^{2}).}

The force of friction is negative the velocity gradient of the dissipation function,

. The function is half the rate at which energy is being dissipated by the system through friction.
