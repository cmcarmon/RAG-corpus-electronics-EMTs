GNSS Avionics performing the position determination functions will require augmentation to achieve the
necessary accuracy. The augmentation will be provided by a data communications system and will be in the
form of positional information correction. A data communications system will also be required to provide the
frequent broadcast of position information to the ground. A modiÔ¨Åed Mode S transponder squitter is expected
to provide that function.
