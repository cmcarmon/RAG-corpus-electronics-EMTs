Test personnel should conduct cable assembly link loss, and cable plant transmission loss
measurements in both directions and at each system operational wavelength. By performing these
measurements in each direction, test personnel can better characterize cable and link losses. Unlike
optical time-domain reflectometry, bidirectional readings are always possible when performing power
meter measurements. In power meter measurements, by definition, end users have access to both ends of
the cable or cable plant.
