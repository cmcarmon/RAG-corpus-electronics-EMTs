Plane waves are the simplest solution of Maxwell’s equations in
a homogeneous region of space, such as free space (vacuum).
In spite of their simplicity, plane waves have played an impor-
tant role throughout the development of electromagnetics,
starting from the time of the earliest radio transmissions
through the development of modern communications systems.
Plane waves are important for several reasons. First, the far-
ﬁeld radiation from any transmitting antenna has the charac-
teristics of a plane wave sufﬁciently far from the antenna. The
incoming wave ﬁeld impinging on a receiving antenna can
therefore usually be approximated as a plane wave. Second,
the exact ﬁeld radiated by any source in a region of space can
be constructed in terms of a continuous spectrum of plane
waves via the Fourier transform. Understanding the nature of
plane waves is thus important for understanding both the far-
ﬁeld and the exact radiation from sources.
