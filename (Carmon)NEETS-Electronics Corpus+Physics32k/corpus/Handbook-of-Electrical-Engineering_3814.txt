Single-ridge  and  double-ridge  waveguides  are  shown  in  Fig.  37.14.  The  modes  of  these  waveguides  bear
similarities  to  those  of  rectangular  guides,  but  can  only  be  derived  numerically  [Montgomery,  1971].  Ridge
waveguides  are  useful  because  their  dominant  ranges  exceed  those  of  rectangular  waveguides.  However,  this
range increase is obtained at the expense of higher losses.
