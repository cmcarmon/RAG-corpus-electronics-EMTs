In  bandwidth-efÔ¨Åcient  digital  communication  systems  the  effect  of  each  symbol  transmitted  over  a  time
dispersive channel extends beyond the time interval used to represent that symbol. The distortion caused by
the resulting overlap of received symbols is called intersymbol interference (ISI) [Lucky et al., 1968]. ISI arises
in all pulse-modulation systems, including frequency-shift keying (FSK), phase-shift keying (PSK), and quadra-
ture amplitude modulation (QAM) [Lucky et al., 1968]. However, its effect can be most easily described for a
baseband PAM system.
