Figure 4.14(C). In fact, one would need a ﬁlter that is more
or less equivalent to the pseudo-inverse in frequencies where
the signal to noise ratio is high but has little effect in regions
where the signal to noise ratio is low. One way to accomplish
this is using the Wiener ﬁlter which is optimum for a given
image and noise statistics. We describe it in what follows.
