Links between LEO satellites (or the NASA Shuttle), and GEO satellites are used for data relay, for example,
via the NASA tracking and data relay satellite system (TDRSS). Some systems will use intersatellite links (ISL)
to  improve  the  interconnectivity  of  a  wide-area  network.  ISL  systems  would  typically  operate  at  frequencies
such as 23 GHz, 60 GHz, or even use optical links.
