With advances in digital signal processing and compression techniques, analog video and audio transmission
will  increasingly  be  converted  to  digital  transmissions.  The  advanced  compression  techniques  reduce  the
bandwidth  requirements  and  allow  for  smaller  and  lower-cost  VSAT  antennas  to  be  used.  The  continued
technological  advances  in  satellite  technology  and  the  emerging  demand  for  more  ï¬‚exible  communication
services  will  generate  new  satellite  communications  applications,  such  as  LAN  interconnections  and  ISDN
support  [Murthy  and  Gordon,  1989].  Satellite  communications  will  also  play  an  increasing  role  in  mobile
communications on land, air, and on sea. In addition to telephony services, new services such as global distress
and safety applications, global positioning, navigation, voice messaging, and data transmissions are now possible.
