The concepts of longitudinal and transverse mass (equivalent to those of Lorentz) were also used by Einstein in his first papers on relativity. However, in special relativity they apply to the entire mass of matter, not only to the electromagnetic part. Later it was shown by physicists like Richard Chace Tolman that expressing mass as the ratio of force and acceleration is not advantageous. Therefore, a similar concept without direction dependent terms, in which force is defined as






F
→

d




p
→




/


d

{\displaystyle {\vec {F}}=\mathrm {d} {\vec {p}}/\mathrm {d} t}
, was used as relativistic mass

{\displaystyle M={\frac {m_{0}}{\sqrt {1-{\frac {v^{2}}{c^{2}}}}}},\qquad m_{0}={\frac {E}{c^{2}}},}

This concept is sometimes still used in modern physics textbooks, although the term 'mass' is now considered by many to refer to invariant mass, see mass in special relativity.
