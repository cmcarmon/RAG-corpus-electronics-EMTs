At every instant, each process has a current working direc-
tory, in which path names not beginning with a slash are
looked for. In Figure 4.3, if etc is the current directory, then
the path name passwd denotes the same Ô¨Åle as etc/passwd. A
process can change its working directory by issuing a system
call specifying the new working directory.
