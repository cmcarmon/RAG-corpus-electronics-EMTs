Equation 12.241 is an ordinary second-order linear homogeneous differential
equation with constant coefficients similar to those derived in earlier sections
of this chapter.
To complete the node analysis, we complete Steps 4 and 5 by solving Equa-
tion 12.241 for v1, and using it to determine v2 and any other branch variables
of interest. Given the form of Equation 12.241, we expect its solution to be a
superposition of two terms of the form Ae st. The substitution of this candidate
term into Equation 12.241 yields
