Controlled Load Service
Controlled Load service is an enhanced quality of service
intended to support RTT applications requiring better per-
formance than that provided by the traditional best-effort
service. It approximates the end-to-end behavior provided by
best effort under unloaded conditions. The assumption here is
that under unloaded conditions, a very high percentage of the
transmitted packets are successfully delivered to the end nodes,
and the transmission delay experienced by a very high percent-
age of the delivered packets will not vary much from the
minimum transit delay.
