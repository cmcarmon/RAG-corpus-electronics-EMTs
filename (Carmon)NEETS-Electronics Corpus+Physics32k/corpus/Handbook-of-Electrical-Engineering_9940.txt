The differences in root locus designs and frequency response designs appear only in the interpretation of
the  control-system  speciÔ¨Åcations. A  root  locus  design  that  improves  the  low-frequency  characteristics  of  the
system will result in a phase-lag controller; a phase-lead compensator results if the design improves the high-
frequency response of the system. If a root locus design is performed, the frequency response characteristics of
the system should be investigated. Also, if a frequency response design is performed, the poles of the closed-
loop transfer function should be calculated.
