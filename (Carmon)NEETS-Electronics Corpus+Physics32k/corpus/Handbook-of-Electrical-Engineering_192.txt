I2t (ampere squared seconds): A convenient way of indicating the heating effect or thermal energy which is
produced  during  a  fault  condition  before  the  circuit  protective  device  has  opened  the  circuit.  As  a
protective device, the HRC or current-limiting fuse lets through far less damaging I 2t than other protective
devices.
