a complex exponential, so is the current, with an amplitude I =

and a frequency the same as the voltage. Clearly, if the current were assumed to be a complex exponential,
dt (v). Letting the voltage be a complex exponential, we have
so would the voltage. For a capacitor, i = C d
i = CV j2πf ej2πf t. The amplitude of this complex exponential is I = CV j2πf. Finally, for the inductor,
dt (i), assuming the current to be a complex exponential results in the voltage having the form
where v = L d
v = LIj2πf ej2πf t, making its complex amplitude V = LIj2πf.
