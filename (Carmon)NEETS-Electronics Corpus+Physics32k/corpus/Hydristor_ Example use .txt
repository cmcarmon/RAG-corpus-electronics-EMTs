Because the Hydristor is more easily packaged as a thin, large diameter device, it is easy to create a torque converter shape which, with the proper adapters, can fit any existing vehicle. Thus a few 'standard' Hydristors can be made which, with adapters will fit everything making the technology completely retrofittable into the entire highway fleet. As engine rpm is now variably decoupled from wheel speed, the engine can run at its most efficient point at all times. With the very fast response time of the Hydristor, a change in demand allows the engine to quickly hit the desired point without interrupting power flow.
