In such files, the equation of motion follows,

with the boundary conditions:

and with the initial condition, Eq. (3), where the particles’ initial positions obey:

The file diffusion coefficients are taken independently from the PDF,

where Λ has a finite value that represents the fastest diffusion coefficient in the file.
