 of a D/A or A/D IC is usually speciﬁed in terms of the bits in the digital code or in terms of
–  1  steps
the  least  signiﬁcant  bit  (LSB)  of  the  system.  An 
between quantization levels. As the number of bits increases, the step size between quantization levels decreases,
therefore increasing the accuracy of the system when a conversion is made between an analog and digital signal.
The system resolution can be speciﬁed also as the voltage step size between quantization levels. For A/D circuits,
the resolution is the smallest input voltage that is detected by the system.
