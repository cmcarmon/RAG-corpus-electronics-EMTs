where µ is the permeability, A is the cross-sectional area perpendicular to the direction of l, and
l stands for the corresponding portion of the length of the magnetic circuit along the ﬂux path.
Based on the analogy between magnetic circuits and dc resistive circuits, Table 11.2.1 summarizes
the corresponding quantities. Further, the laws of resistances in series and parallel also hold for
reluctances.
