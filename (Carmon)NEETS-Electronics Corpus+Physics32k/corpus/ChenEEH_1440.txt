Perhaps the most radical departure from current silicon
technology is to exploit advances in molecular science (Collier
et al., 1999) and microﬂuidic systems (McCaskill and Wagler,
2000) for implementing reconﬁgurable architectures. If suc-
cessful, these approaches will have a signiﬁcant impact on the
future of conﬁgurable computing.
