In this section, we ﬁrst study a simple power ﬂow problem
to gain insight into the nonlinear nature of the power ﬂow
equations. We then formulate the power ﬂow problem for the
large power system. A classical power ﬂow solution method
based on the Gauss-Seidel algorithm is studied. The popular
Newton-Raphson algorithm, which is the most commonly
used power ﬂow method in the industry today, is introduced.
We then brieﬂy consider the fast decoupled power ﬂow algo-
rithm, which is a heuristic method that has proved quite
effective for quick power ﬂow computations. Finally, we will
discuss the dc power ﬂow solution that is a highly simpliﬁed
algorithm for computing approximate linear solutions of the
power ﬂow problem and is becoming widely used for elec-
tricity market calculations.
