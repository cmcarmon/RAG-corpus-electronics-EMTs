Before proceeding with the introduction of the Yee algo-
rithm, it is instructive to consider simpliﬁed two-dimensional
cases for Maxwell’s equations. These cases demonstrate im-
portant electromagnetic wave phenomena and can yield in-
sight into the analytical and algorithmic features of the general
three-dimensional case.
