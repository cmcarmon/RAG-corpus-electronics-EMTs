A generalization and enhancement on the delta cepstrum is
represented by the shifted delta cepstrum (SDC) (Bielefeld,
1994) in which a set of ﬂexible parameters is used to construct
enhanced cepstral vectors. The SDC has been shown to be
beneﬁcial in limited study (Bielefeld, 1994; Torres-Carrasquillo
et al., 2002).
