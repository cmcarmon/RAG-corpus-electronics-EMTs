In cases when the use of a minimum of af modulator power is desired, a form of low-level 
modulation is necessary. The CONTROL-GRID MODULATOR is used widely in portable and mobile 
equipment to reduce size and power requirements. It is also used in extremely high-power, wideband 
equipment such as television transmitters where high-level or plate modulation is difficult and costly to 
achieve. Figure 1-48 is a basic schematic for a typical control-grid modulator.
