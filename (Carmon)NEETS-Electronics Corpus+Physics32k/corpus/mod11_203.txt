Microwave tunnel-diode oscillators are useful in applications that require microwatts or, at most, a 
few milliwatts of power, such as local oscillators for microwave superheterodyne receivers. Tunnel-diode 
oscillators can be mechanically or electronically tuned over frequency ranges of about one octave and 
have a top-end frequency limit of approximately 10 gigahertz.
