There are many applications in electronic circuits where nonlinear devices are
operated only over a very restricted range of voltage or current, as in many sen-
sor applications and most audio amplifiers, for example. In such cases, it makes
sense to find a piecewise linear device model in a way that ensures maximum
accuracy of fit over that narrow operating range. This process of linearizing
device models over a very narrow operating range is called incremental analysis
or small-signal analysis. The benefit of incremental analysis is that the incre-
mental variables satisfy KVL and KCL, as well as linear v i relations over the
narrow operating range.
