The fireman proceeded southwards; when he saw the approaching headlight of the oncoming northbound train he attempted to light a fusee but slipped and fell on the icy ballast, he waved stop signals but did not appear to be seen. The northbound train was composed of 16 cars hauled by EMD E6 diesel electric units 506-503, and EMD E3A unit 500 and was travelling at 80 mph when it approached the stationary southbound train. The engineer did not see a warning signal until he had passed the front of it; then he saw stop signals (being given by a passenger) 1000 feet ahead at the same time as he saw the derailed cars. Despite applying the emergency brakes a collision was inevitable. 74 passengers were killed (some sources say 72); there was only one fatality on the halted southbound train, most of the deaths were servicemen on the northbound train, traveling home for the holidays. According to the official report 'the third car stopped on top of the second car', most fatalities occurring in these two cars.
