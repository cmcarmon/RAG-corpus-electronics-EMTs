Modeling plays a central role in this design phase. Different
model instantiations, abstraction levels, and accuracy require-
ments have to be dealt with during concept reﬁnement. In
addition, multinature systems in general operate time-con-
tinuously, but the information processing inherent to most
such systems consists of digital hardware and software
modules, which are best represented in a time- or even-discrete
way. Levels of abstraction are well-deﬁned in the digital
domain. They are summarized in Table 3.1.
