Arithmetic codes provide information redundancy, where
extra information is encoded with the operands, and this
information is processed concurrently with the operands. For
residue codes (Avizienis, 1973; Rao, 1968; Sparmann and
Reddy, 1994), the additional information is a residue, which
is generated by performing a mod operation on each operand.
