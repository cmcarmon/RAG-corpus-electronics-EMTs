From the early stages, the spaceport has been host to several vertical launches by UP Aerospace. As the first tenant, it had access to multiple functional vertical takeoff facilities of the then incomplete spaceport. As of 2015, UP Aerospace continues to operate its suborbital flights from the spaceport.
