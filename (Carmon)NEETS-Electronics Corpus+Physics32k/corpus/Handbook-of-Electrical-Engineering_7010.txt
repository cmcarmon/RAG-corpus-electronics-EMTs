The goal of the encoder (Fig. 73.13) is to convert strings of binary data (messages) into channel-input signals.
Source strings of m bits are translated into channel input strings of n symbols (with m Â£ n) for discrete channels,
and  into  continuous-time  signals  of  duration  T  for  continuous-time  channels.  The  channel  code  (or  more
precisely the codebook) is the list of 2m codewords (channel input signals) that may be sent by the encoder.
The rate of the code is equal to the logarithm of its size divided by the duration of the codewords. Thus, the
rate is equal to
