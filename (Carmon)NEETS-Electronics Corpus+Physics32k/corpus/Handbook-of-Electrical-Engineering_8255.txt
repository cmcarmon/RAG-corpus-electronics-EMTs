Data acquisition systems are usually designed to couple with existing computer systems, and many computer
systems provide standard bus architecture, allowing users to connect various peripherals that are compatible
with its bus. Data acquisition systems are computer peripherals that follow the above description. Since ADCs
produce parallel data, many data acquisition systems provide outputs compatible with parallel instrument buses
such as the IEEE-488 (HP-IB or GPIB) or the VMEbus. Personal computer-based data acquisition boards must
have  communication  interfaces  compatible  with  the  computer  bus  in  order  to  share  resources.  The  RS-232
standard communication interfaces are widely used in serial data transfer. Communication interfaces for data
acquisition systems are normally designed to satisfy the electrical, mechanical, and protocol standards of the
interface bus. Electrical standards include power supply requirements, methods of supply, the data transfer rate
(baud rate), the width of the address, and the line terminating impedance. Mechanical requirements are the
