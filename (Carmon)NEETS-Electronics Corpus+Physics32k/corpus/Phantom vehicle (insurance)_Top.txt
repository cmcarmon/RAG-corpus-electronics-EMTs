In vehicle insurance, a phantom vehicle is one that causes injury, death, or damage without making physical contact. For example, a run-off-road accident can be caused by a car in the opposing direction drifting partly over the centre line of a highway, then veering away. The name refers to the fact that in most such cases, the driver of the phantom vehicle, much like a hit and run driver, leaves the scene, and thus in the subsequent accident investigation, the presence of the vehicle is known only through eye witness testimony, unless a dashcam records video evidence.
