Finally, we note that arguments similar to those presented here can be
made for inductors connected in series. The corresponding circuit is shown
in Figure 9.52. Initially, the switch is closed, allowing each inductor to carry
an arbitrary current. Then, the switch opens. In this way, two inductors with
different initial currents are connected in series. Using arguments similar to
those presented earlier it is possible to determine the inductor currents and flux
linkages after the switch opens. Then, it is straightforward to show that energy
is lost during the opening of the switch.
