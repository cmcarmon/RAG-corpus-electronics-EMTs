Renewal theory texts usually also define the spent time or the backward recurrence time (or the current lifetime) as



Z
(
t
)
=
t
âˆ’

J

N
(
t
)




{\displaystyle Z(t)=t-J_{N(t)}}
. Its distribution can be calculated in a similar way to that of the residual time. Likewise, the total life time is the sum of backward recurrence time and forward recurrence time.
