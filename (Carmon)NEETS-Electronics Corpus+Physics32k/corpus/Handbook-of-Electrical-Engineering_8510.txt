In 1937, Claude Shannon published in the Transactions of the AIEE the circuit principles for an “electric
adder to the base of two”, and George Stibitz of Bell Labs built such an adding device on his own kitchen
table.  In  that  same  year,  Howard  Aiken,  then  a  student  at  Harvard,  proposed  a  gigantic  calculating
machine that could be used for everything from vacuum tube design to problems in relativistic physics.
With  support  from  Thomas  J.  Watson,  president  of  IBM,  Aiken  was  able  to  build  his  machine,  the
“Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator”, or “Mark I”. When it was ﬁnished in 1944, the Mark I was
quickly pressed into war service, calculating ballistics problems for the Navy.
