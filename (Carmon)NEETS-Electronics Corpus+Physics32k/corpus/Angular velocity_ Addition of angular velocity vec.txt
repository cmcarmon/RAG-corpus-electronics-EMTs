Angular velocity can be defined as angular displacement per unit time. If a point rotates with




ω

2




{\displaystyle \omega _{2}}
in a frame




F

2




{\displaystyle F_{2}}
that itself rotates with an angular velocity




ω

1




{\displaystyle \omega _{1}}
with respect to an external frame




F

1




{\displaystyle F_{1}}
, we can define the addition of




ω

1


+

ω

2




{\displaystyle \omega _{1}+\omega _{2}}
as the angular velocity vector of the point with respect to




F

1




{\displaystyle F_{1}}
.
With this operation defined like this, angular velocity, which is a pseudovector, also becomes a real vector because it has two operations:
An internal operation (addition), which is associative, commutative, distributive and with zero and unity elements
An external operation (external product), with the normal properties for an external product.
This is the definition of a vector space. The only property that presents difficulties to prove is the commutativity of the addition. This can be proven from the fact that the velocity tensor W (see below) is skew-symmetric. Therefore,



R
=

e

W
t




{\displaystyle R=e^{Wt}}
is a rotation matrix and in a time dt is an infinitesimal rotation matrix. Therefore, it can be expanded as



R
=
I
+
W
⋅

(
W
⋅
d
t

)

+
…


{\displaystyle R=I+W\cdot dt+{1 \over 2}(W\cdot dt)^{2}+\ldots }

The composition of rotations is not commutative; but, when the rotations are infinitesimal, the first order approximation of the previous series can be taken and



(

W

(

{\displaystyle (I+W_{1}\cdot dt)(I+W_{2}\cdot dt)=(I+W_{2}\cdot dt)(I+W_{1}\cdot dt)}
and therefore
