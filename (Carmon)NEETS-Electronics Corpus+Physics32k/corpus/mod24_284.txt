During vapor phase oxidation, the mandrel or tube continuously moves from side to side and rotates
while soot particles are deposited on the surface. This process forms cylindrical layers of soot on the
surface of the mandrel or inside the hollow tube. This deposited material is transformed into a solid glass
preform by heating the porous material (without melting). The solid preform is then drawn or pulled into
an optical fiber by a process called fiber drawing.
