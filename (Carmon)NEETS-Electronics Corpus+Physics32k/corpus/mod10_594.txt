In space, these two fields will be in phase and perpendicular to each other at any given time. 
Although a conductor is usually considered present when a moving electric or magnetic field is 
mentioned, the laws that govern these fields say nothing about a conductor. Therefore, these laws hold 
true whether a conductor is present or not.
