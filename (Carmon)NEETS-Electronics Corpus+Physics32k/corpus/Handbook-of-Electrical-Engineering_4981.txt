where t
2 are the relaxation times of the two contiguous layers or strata of respective thicknesses d1 and
d2; t is the overall relaxation time of the two-layer combination and is deﬁned by t = (e¢1 d2
2d1),
where  e¢1,  e¢2, s
2 are the respective real permittivity and conductivity parameters of the two discrete
layers.  Note  that  since  e¢1 and  e¢2 are  temperature-  and  frequency-dependent  and  s
2  are,  in  addition,
also voltage-dependent, the values of  t and  e† will in turn also be inﬂuenced by these three variables. Space
charge processes involving electrons are more effectively analyzed, using dc measurement techniques. If retrap-
ping of electrons in polymers is neglected, then the decay current as a function of time t, arising from detrapped
electrons, assumes the form [Watson, 1995]
