The applications of MEMS are conveniently grouped ac-
cording to major industries. This approach also raises ques-
tions. For example, should the transportation industry, which
has very large components, (e.g., the automotive or aerospace
industries) be considered as one entity or be subdivided into
its units? Similarly, the communications industry embraces
both Ô¨Åber optic and wireless radio-frequency networks. It is
simple and useful to group applications of MEMS as indicated
in Figure 6.7. We will provide an overview of the types of
MEMS in each of the four major categories, including details
on particular applications in some of the large industries
shown in the top of Figure 6.7.
