Level 8 is concerned with communication between pro-
cesses, which can be arranged through a single mechanism
called a pipe. A pipe is a one-way channel: data streams in
one end and out the other. A request to read items is delayed
until items are actually in the pipe. A pipe can connect two
processes of the same machine or of different machines equally
well. Pipes are implemented in UNIX, MS-DOS, and many
other systems.
