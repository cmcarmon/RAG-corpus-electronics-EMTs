Vectors are elements of V, and scalars are elements of F. Often,
one uses the terminology vector space V over the ﬁeld F. What
form vectors may take will be examined more closely in
Section 1.3. For the purposes of this treatise, and for the
following MATLAB examples, the ﬁeld of real numbers, R,
will be used most often. The reader is urged to remember that
any choice of ﬁeld is allowed.
