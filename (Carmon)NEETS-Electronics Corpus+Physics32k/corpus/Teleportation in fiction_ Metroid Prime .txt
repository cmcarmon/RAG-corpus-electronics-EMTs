The first Metroid Prime features the Chozo Temple, which near the end of the game becomes the site of a glowing portal to the Impact Crater. The main character Samus can step into the circle and be instantly transported into the hollow core of the meteor that crashed there.
In Prime 2: Echoes, when Samus obtains the Light Suit, she can step into beams of golden light to teleport to secret areas, or temple Energy Converters. Pirate Commandos appear to teleport in combat at first, but they are later revealed to travel via an alternate dimension instead, making the travel take just as long as it would have otherwise. The benefit then comes not from instant travel, but from being invisible to and unable to be harmed by their target as they move. Said alternate dimension is a parallel world that the main character can travel to via rifts in spacetime.
In the final part of the trilogy, Corruption, there is a single teleporter on planet Bryyo. Stepping into it transports Samus to a hidden site at the opposite side of the planet in a flash of light. Some creatures in the game, such as Warp Hounds and Pirate Commandos, are able to teleport through their own power and technology. Leviathans can open wormholes, which have a similar effect, except that they allow multiple beings, objects and space ships to pass through at once.
