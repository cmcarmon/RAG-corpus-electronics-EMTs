where Q is the integer quotient rearranged as Q0 = b1 + r(b2 + … + bm–1 ))))r and R is the remainder R0 = b0.
A second division by r yields Q0 /r = Q1 + R1 /r, where Q1 is arranged as Q1 = b2 + r(b3 + … + bm–1)))r and R1 =
b1. Thus, by repeated division of the integer result Qi by r, the remainders yield (b0, b1, b2, …, bm–1)r in that order.
The conversion method just described, called the radix divide method, can be used to convert between any
two integers of different radices. However, the requirement is that the arithmetic required by Ns /r must be carried
out  in  source  radix,  s.  Except  for  source  radices  10  and  2,  this  poses  a  severe  problem  for  humans.  Table  86.4
provides the recommended procedures for integer conversion. The radix divide method is suitable for computer
conversion providing, of course, that the computer is programmed to carry out the arithmetic in different radices.
