For low-data-rate applications, fiber optic transmitters generally use LEDs operating in either the
850-nm or 1300-nm window as their source. For the lowest data rates (0 to 20 megabits per second
(Mbps)), sources tend to operate in the 850-nm window. For moderate data rates (50 to 200 Mbps),
sources tend to operate in the 1300-nm window. Laser sources are almost never used in low-data-rate
applications. Laser sources are only used when extremely high transmitter output powers are required in
the application. The packages found in low-data-rate applications include all of the package types
discussed earlier.
