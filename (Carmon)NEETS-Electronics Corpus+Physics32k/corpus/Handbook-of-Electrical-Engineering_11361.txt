Positron Emission Tomography
Unlike computerized tomography, which relies on photons produced by an external source, in the modalities
of  positron  emission  tomography  (PET)  and  single  photon  emission  computed  tomography  (SPECT),  the
source of radiation is a radioisotope that is distributed within the body, and thus these modalities are sometimes
referred  to  as  forms  of  emission  computed  tomography  (ECT). While  conventional  CT  can  produce  images
based upon anatomy of organs, emission CT techniques can quantitate the distribution of tracer materials that
can potentially elucidate physiologic function.
