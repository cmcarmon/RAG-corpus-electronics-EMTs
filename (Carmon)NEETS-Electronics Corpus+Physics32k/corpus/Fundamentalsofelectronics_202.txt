From another viewpoint, the real-part of complex power represents long-term energy consump-
tion/production. Energy is the integral of power and, as the integration interval increases, the ﬁrst term
appreciates while the time-varying term “sloshes.” Consequently, the most convenient deﬁnition of the av-
erage power consumed/produced by any circuit is in terms of complex amplitudes.
