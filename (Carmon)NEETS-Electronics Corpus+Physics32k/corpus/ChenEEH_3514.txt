. Quantized continuous-time signals: A quantized con-
tinuous-time (boxcar) signal is a special case of a con-
tinuous-time signal, where the range of the signal is
ﬁnite or countably inﬁnite (i.e. it is a function deﬁned
over a continuum of values of the independent variable,
while the range of values the signal assumes is discrete).
