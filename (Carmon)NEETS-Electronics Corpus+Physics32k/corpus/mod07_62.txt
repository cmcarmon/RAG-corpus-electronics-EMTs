with over a thousand volts applied to its plate whereas the maximum allowable voltage for a transistor is
limited to about 200 volts (usually 50 volts or less). A tube can also handle thousands of watts of power.
The maximum power output for transistor generally ranges from 30 milliwatts to slightly over 100 watts.
