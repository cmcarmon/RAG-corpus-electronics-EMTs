For satellite communications, parallel frequencies can be used without interference by using 
polarized radiation. The system setup is shown in figure 4-8. One pair of satellite antennas is vertically 
polarized and another pair is horizontally polarized. Either vertically or horizontally polarized 
transmissions are received by the respective antenna and retransmitted in the same polarization. For 
example, transmissions may be made in the 3.7 to 3.74 GHz range on the vertical polarization path and in 
the 3.72 to 3.76 GHz range on the horizontal polarization path without adjacent frequency (co-channel) 
interference.
