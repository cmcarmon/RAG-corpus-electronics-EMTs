where C is a counterclockwise contour of integration which is a closed path completely contained within the
ROC of S(z). Recall that the DTFT was obtained by taking the CT Fourier transform of the CT sampling model
sa(t). Similarly, the bilateral z-transform results by taking the bilateral Laplace transform of sa(t). If the lower
limit on the summation of Eq. (14.14a) is taken to be n = 0, then Eqs. (14.14a) and (14.14b) become the one-
sided z-transform, which is the DT equivalent of the one-sided Laplace transform for CT signals.
