The micropower impulse radar was developed by engineer Tom McEwan as part of a device designed
to measure the one billion pulses of light emitted from LLNLâ€™s Nova laser in a single second. The system
he developed is the size of a cigarette box and consists of about $10 worth of parts. The same measurement
had been made previously using $40,000 worth of equipment.
