The Y combinator, discovered by Haskell B. Curry, is defined as:




Y
=
λ
f
.
(
λ
x
.
f

(
x

x
)
)

(
λ
x
.
f

(
x

x
)
)


{\displaystyle Y=\lambda f.(\lambda x.f\ (x\ x))\ (\lambda x.f\ (x\ x))}

Beta reduction of this gives,
By repeatedly applying this equality we get,




Y

g
=
g

(
Y

g
)
=
g

(
g

(
Y

g
)
)
=
g

(
…
g

(
Y

g
)
…
)


{\displaystyle Y\ g=g\ (Y\ g)=g\ (g\ (Y\ g))=g\ (\ldots g\ (Y\ g)\ldots )}
