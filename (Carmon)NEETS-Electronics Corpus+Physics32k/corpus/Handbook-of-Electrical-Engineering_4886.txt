where  n  is  the  number  of  conduction  carriers/volume.  RH  depends  on  the  sign  of  the  charge  of  the  current
carriers  being  negative  for  electrons  and  positive  for  holes.  This  identiÔ¨Åcation  of  the  carrier  sign  is  itself  a
matter of great importance, particularly in semiconductor physics. If more than one band is involved in electrical
conduction,  then  by  imposing  the  boundary  condition  required  for  the  geometry  of  Fig.  52.1  that  the  total
current in the y direction from all bands must vanish, Jy = 0, it is easy to show that [Wilson, 1958]
