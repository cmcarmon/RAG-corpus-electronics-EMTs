Low-loss LiNbO3 Mach–Zehnder modulators are available with insertion losses less than 3 dB, modulation
bandwidths  greater  than  a  few  gigahertz,  and  switching  voltages  near  5  V.  The  output  intensity  of  these
modulators is a sinusoidal function of the bias voltage. By prebiasing to 50% transmission, modulation applied
to the Mach–Zehnder results in the most linear intensity modulation. This bias point, which corresponds to
the point of inﬂection in the sinusoidal transfer function, produces zero second-order distortion. Unfortunately,
the corresponding third-order distortion is approximately 30 dB worse than a typical directly modulated DFB
laser, at low frequencies. This comparison is shown on Fig. 71.5. For high-frequency applications where RD is
important, external modulators can offer improved linearity. A means of linearizing the third-order nonlinearity
is essential for AM-VSB applications.
