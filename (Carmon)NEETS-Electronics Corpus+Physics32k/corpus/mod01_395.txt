The active ingredient in electrolyte (sulfuric acid, potassium hydroxide, etc.) is heavier than water. 
Therefore, the electrolyte has a specific gravity greater than 1.0. The acceptable range of specific gravity 
for a given battery is provided by the battery's manufacturer. To measure a battery's specific gravity, use 
an instrument called a HYDROMETER.
