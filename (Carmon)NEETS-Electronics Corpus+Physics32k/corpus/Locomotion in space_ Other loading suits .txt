DYNASUIT concept
The DYNASUIT is a conceptual design that involves a suit that can be divided into many subsystems. Each subsytem controls a different aspect of the suit. For example, there is a bio-parameter subsystem that would measure physiological responses like muscle signals (EMG), heart rate, electrocardiogram, ventilation rate, body temperature, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation. There is also a central control unit or the equivalent of the suit's brain, as well as an artificial muscle subsystem that proposes to use either electro-active polymers (EAP) or pneumatics to apply forces on the body. There is also a proposed user interface to help the astronaut interact with the suit. This potential design is still in the development phase and has not been prototyped at this point.
Bio-suit
The Bio-suit is lightweight and form-fitting. It is pressurized and designed to provide much more mobility than the average suit. When the astronaut initially puts it on, it fits loosely on the body. Then they plug the suit into a power module and the spring-like coils in the suit contract to form-fit the suit to the body. Dava Newman, Deputy Administrator of NASA, and her colleagues have designed this skinsuit to employs heat-activated shape-memory alloy (SMA) in the coils. The initial tests are promising in terms of the forces applied to the body. The design of the coil is explained in an article in the journal IEEE/ASME: Transactions on Mechatronics. The Biosuit has the potential to be ready for use in the Mars missions in the next 10 years.
