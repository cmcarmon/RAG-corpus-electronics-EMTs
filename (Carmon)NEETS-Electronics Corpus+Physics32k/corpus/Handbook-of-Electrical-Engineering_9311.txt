Flow of Control
The term ﬂow of control refers to the order in which individual instructions of a program are performed. For
the speciﬁcation of the ﬂow of control, assembly (machine) languages (and older high-level languages) provide
conditional  and  unconditional  branch  instructions.  Programmers  discovered  that  the  indiscriminate  use  of
these instructions frequently leads to ﬂow structures too complex to be analyzed at reasonable costs. On the
other hand, keeping the ﬂow of control reasonably simple is, indeed, possible since three elementary control
