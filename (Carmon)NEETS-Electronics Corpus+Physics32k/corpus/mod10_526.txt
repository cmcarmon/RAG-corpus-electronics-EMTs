A resonant line is sometimes said to be resonant at an applied frequency. This means that at one
frequency the line acts as a resonant circuit. It may act either as a high-resistive circuit (parallel resonant)
or as a low-resistive circuit (series resonant). The line may be made to act in this manner by either open-
or short-circuiting it at the output end and cutting it to some multiple of a quarter-wavelength.
