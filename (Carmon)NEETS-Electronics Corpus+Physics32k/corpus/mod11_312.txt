Another type of lens that you may see is the DIELECTRIC or METALLIC DELAY LENS shown in 
figure 3-11. The delay lens, as its name implies, slows down the phase propagation (velocity) as the wave 
passes through the lens. The delay lens is convex and is constructed of dielectric material. The delay in 
the phase of the wave passing through the lens is determined by the DIELECTRIC CONSTANT 
(REFRACTIVE INDEX) of the material. In most cases, artificial dielectrics, consisting of conducting 
rods or spheres that are small compared to the wavelength, are used. (Artificial dielectrics are of 
three-dimensional construction and act as a dielectric to electromagnetic waves.) In this case the inner 
portion of the transmitted wave is decelerated for a longer interval of time than the outer portions. The 
delay causes the radiated wave to be collimated.
