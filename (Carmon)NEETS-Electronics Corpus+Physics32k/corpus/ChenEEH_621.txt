It should be stressed that when neq  n, the precision of the
particular Ô¨Åxed-point system is better than that of the LNS
derived by equations 1.13 and 1.14. Equation 1.16 reveals that
the particular LNS, while meeting the precision of an n-bit
linear representation, in fact covers the range provided by an
neq-bit linear system.
