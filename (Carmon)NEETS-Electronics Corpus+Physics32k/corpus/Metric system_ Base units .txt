The modern metric system consists of four electromechanical base units representing four fundamental dimensions of measure: length, mass, time and electromagnetism. The units are the metre for length, kilogram for mass, second for time, and ampere for electromagnetism. Together they are capable of measuring any known quantity. There are also three additional supplemental base units which are not independent: the kelvin, a thermodynamic measure; the candela, a measure of irradiance; and the mole, representing a quantity of substance.
