Subthreshold Control
When a MOSFET is in the “off ” condition, that is, when the MOSFET is in subthreshold, the off current drawn
with the drain at supply voltage must not be too large in order to avoid power consumption and discharge of
ostensibly isolated nodes [Shoji, 1988]. In small devices, however, the source and drain are closely spaced, so
there exists a danger of direct interaction of the drain with the source, rather than an interaction mediated by
the gate and channel. In an extreme case, the drain may draw current directly from the source, even though
the gate is “off ” (punchthrough). A less extreme but also undesirable case occurs when the drain and gate jointly
control the carrier density in the channel (drain-induced barrier lowering, or drain control of threshold voltage).
