he last three decades have witnessed a revo-
lution in electrical and, especially, electron-
ics technology. This revolution was paced by
changes  in  solid-state  electronics  that  greatly
expanded  capabilities  while  at  the  same  time  radi-
cally reduced costs. The entire Ô¨Åeld of electrical engi-
neering  has  grown  far  beyond  the  boundaries  that
characterized it just a generation ago. Electrical engi-
neers have become the creators and masters of the
most  pervasive  technology  of  our  time,  with  pro-
found effects on society and on their profession.
