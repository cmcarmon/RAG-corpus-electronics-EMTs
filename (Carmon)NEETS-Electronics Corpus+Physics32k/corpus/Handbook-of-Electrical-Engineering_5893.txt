It  is  expected  that  the  use  of  superconductivity  adds  another  0.4%  to  the  efﬁciency  of  generators.  This
improvement might seem insigniﬁcant (compared to an already achieved ﬁgure of 98% by the conventional
design) but proves considerable in the long run. It is estimated that given a frame size and weight, a supercon-
ducting generator’s capacity is three times that of a conventional one. However, the new concept has to deal
with such practical issues as reliability, availability, and costs before it can be put into large-scale operation.
