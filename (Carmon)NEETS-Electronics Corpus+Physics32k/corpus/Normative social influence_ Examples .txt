Fashion choices are often impacted by normative social influence. In order to feel accepted by a particular crowd, men and women often begin dressing similarly to the individuals within a group that they wish to be associated. Their fashion conformity promotes social cohesion within the group and can be a result of both conscious and unconscious motivations. Similar to fashion conformity, both the male and female view of the ideal body image is often affected by normative social influence. Social media and marketing helps to portray what is commonly considered the current view of physical attractiveness by the masses. As each generation defines the ideal female figure, women feel the pressure to conform in order to avoid the disapproval of others. Likewise, as society continues to define the ideal male body type as muscular and fit, men are also coming under pressure to conform, as well, often leading to changes in their eating habits in order to reach this ideal.
