As we stated earlier, the ionosphere is the region of the atmosphere that extends from about 30 miles 
above the surface of the Earth to about 250 miles. It is appropriately named the ionosphere because it 
consists of several layers of electrically charged gas atoms called ions. The ions are formed by a process 
called ionization.
