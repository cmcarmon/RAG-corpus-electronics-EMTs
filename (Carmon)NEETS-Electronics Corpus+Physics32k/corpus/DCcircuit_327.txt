Finally, the electrical worker will arrive at a point in the safety check procedure where it is
deemed safe to actually touch the conductor(s). Bear in mind that after all of the precautionary
steps have taken, it is still possible (although very unlikely) that a dangerous voltage may be
present. One ﬁnal precautionary measure to take at this point is to make momentary contact
with the conductor(s) with the back of the hand before grasping it or a metal tool in contact
with it. Why? If, for some reason there is still voltage present between that conductor and
earth ground, ﬁnger motion from the shock reaction (clenching into a ﬁst) will break contact
with the conductor. Please note that this is absolutely the last step that any electrical worker
should ever take before beginning work on a power system, and should never be used as an
alternative method of checking for dangerous voltage. If you ever have reason to doubt the
trustworthiness of your meter, use another meter to obtain a ”second opinion.”
