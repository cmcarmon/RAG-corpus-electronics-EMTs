Take note of those two numbers and of the relative sparsity of non-zero digits in them. For
the mass of the proton, all we have is a ”167” preceded by 23 zeros before the decimal point. For
the number of electrons per second in 1 amp, we have ”625” followed by 16 zeros. We call the
span of non-zero digits (from ﬁrst to last), plus any zero digits not merely used for placeholding,
the ”signiﬁcant digits” of any number.
