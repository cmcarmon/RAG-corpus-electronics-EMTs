Fourier Series Representation of CT Periodic Signals
The classical Fourier series representation of a periodic time domain signal s(t) involves an expansion of s(t)
into an inﬁnite series of terms that consist of sinusoidal basis functions, each weighted by a complex constant
(Fourier  coefﬁcient)  that  provides  the  proper  contribution  of  that  frequency  component  to  the  complete
waveform. The conditions under which a periodic signal s(t) can be expanded in a Fourier series are known
as the Dirichlet conditions. They require that in each period s(t) has a ﬁnite number of discontinuities, a ﬁnite
number of maxima and minima, and that s(t) satisﬁes the absolute convergence criterion of Eq. (14.4) [Van
Valkenburg, 1974]:
