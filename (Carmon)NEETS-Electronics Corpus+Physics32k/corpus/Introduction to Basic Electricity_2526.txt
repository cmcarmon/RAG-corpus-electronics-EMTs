The  horizontal  block,  also  referred  to  as  the 
time base, consists of a time/cm rotary switch, a 
 trigger-control switch, and a triggering level control. 
The time/cm switch sets the horizontal sweep rate that 
is to be represented by the horizontal  graduations. 
The lower the setting, the fewer cycles per  second 
are  displayed. The trigger control switch selects the 
source and polarity of the trigger signal. The trigger 
source can be line, internal, or external. The  polarity 
can be positive or negative. When line is selected as 
the trigger source, the power-line frequency of 60 
hertz is used as the trigger frequency. When  internal 
(INT) is selected as the trigger frequency, the input 
signal frequency is used as the trigger frequency.  
 External (EXT) allows a trigger frequency from an 
 external source to be used.
