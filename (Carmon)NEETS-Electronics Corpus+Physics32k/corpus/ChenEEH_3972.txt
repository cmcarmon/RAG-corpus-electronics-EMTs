Two different but closely related methodologies to processor
array design are the dependence method (Moldovan, 1982;
Rao and Kailath, 1988; Kurg, 1988) and the parameter method
(Li and Wah, 1985). Both the dependence method and param-
eter method are based on the assumption that an algorithm is
written in a uniform recurrence nested Do-loop, which can be
depicted as a shift-invariant dependence graph (DG).
