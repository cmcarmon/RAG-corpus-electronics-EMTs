Laminar flow is encountered in practice with very viscous fluids, such as motor oil, flowing through small-diameter tubes, at low velocity. Friction loss under conditions of laminar flow follow the Hagen–Poiseuille equation, which is an exact solution to the Navier-Stokes equations. For a circular pipe with a fluid of density ρ and viscosity μ, the hydraulic slope S can be expressed

{\displaystyle S={\frac {64}{\mathrm {Re} }}{\frac {V^{2}}{2gD}}={\frac {64\nu }{2g}}{\frac {V}{D^{2}}}}

In laminar flow (that is, with Re < ~2000), the hydraulic slope is proportional to the flow velocity.
