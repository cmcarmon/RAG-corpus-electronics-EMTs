The correlation functions of a quantum field theory describe the scattering of particles. The definition of "particle" in relativistic field theory is not self-evident, because if you try to determine the position so that the uncertainty is less than the compton wavelength, the uncertainty in energy is large enough to produce more particles and antiparticles of the same type from the vacuum. This means that the notion of a single-particle state is to some extent incompatible with the notion of an object localized in space.
In the 1930s, Wigner gave a mathematical definition for single-particle states: they are a collection of states that form an irreducible representation of the Poincaré group. Single particle states describe an object with a finite mass, a well defined momentum, and a spin. This definition is fine for protons and neutrons, electrons and photons, but it excludes quarks, which are permanently confined, so the modern point of view is more accommodating: a particle is anything whose interaction can be described in terms of Feynman diagrams, which have an interpretation as a sum over particle trajectories.
A field operator can act to produce a one-particle state from the vacuum, which means that the field operator φ(x) produces a superposition of Wigner particle states. In the free field theory, the field produces one particle states only. But when there are interactions, the field operator can also produce 3-particle, 5-particle (if there is no +/− symmetry also 2, 4, 6 particle) states too. To compute the scattering amplitude for single particle states only requires a careful limit, sending the fields to infinity and integrating over space to get rid of the higher-order corrections.
The relation between scattering and correlation functions is the LSZ-theorem: The scattering amplitude for n particles to go to m particles in a scattering event is the given by the sum of the Feynman diagrams that go into the correlation function for n + m field insertions, leaving out the propagators for the external legs.
For example, for the λφ4 interaction of the previous section, the order λ contribution to the (Lorentz) correlation function is:

Stripping off the external propagators, that is, removing the factors of i/k2, gives the invariant scattering amplitude M:




M
=
i
λ



{\displaystyle M=i\lambda \,}

which is a constant, independent of the incoming and outgoing momentum. The interpretation of the scattering amplitude is that the sum of |M|2 over all possible final states is the probability for the scattering event. The normalization of the single-particle states must be chosen carefully, however, to ensure that M is a relativistic invariant.
Non-relativistic single particle states are labeled by the momentum k, and they are chosen to have the same norm at every value of k. This is because the nonrelativistic unit operator on single particle states is:

{\displaystyle \int dk\,|k\rangle \langle k|\,.}

In relativity, the integral over the k-states for a particle of mass m integrates over a hyperbola in E,k space defined by the energy–momentum relation:

{\displaystyle E^{2}-k^{2}=m^{2}\,.}

If the integral weighs each k point equally, the measure is not Lorentz-invariant. The invariant measure integrates over all values of k and E, restricting to the hyperbola with a Lorentz-invariant delta function:

{\displaystyle \int \delta (E^{2}-k^{2}-m^{2})|E,k\rangle \langle E,k|\,dE\,dk=\int {dk \over 2E}|k\rangle \langle k|\,.}

So the normalized k-states are different from the relativistically normalized k-states by a factor of

{\displaystyle {\sqrt {E}}=\left(k^{2}-m^{2}\right)^{\frac {1}{4}}\,.}

The invariant amplitude M is then the probability amplitude for relativistically normalized incoming states to become relativistically normalized outgoing states.
For nonrelativistic values of k, the relativistic normalization is the same as the nonrelativistic normalization (up to a constant factor √m). In this limit, the φ4 invariant scattering amplitude is still constant. The particles created by the field φ scatter in all directions with equal amplitude.
The nonrelativistic potential, which scatters in all directions with an equal amplitude (in the Born approximation), is one whose Fourier transform is constant—a delta-function potential. The lowest order scattering of the theory reveals the non-relativistic interpretation of this theory—it describes a collection of particles with a delta-function repulsion. Two such particles have an aversion to occupying the same point at the same time.
