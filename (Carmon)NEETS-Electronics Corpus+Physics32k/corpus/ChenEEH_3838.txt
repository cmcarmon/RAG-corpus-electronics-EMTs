Because the images are redundant, the values of c(m, n) tend to
be small. This is illustrated in Figure 4.18, where we can see the
histograms of the image LENA [see Figure 4.6(A)] and the
histogram of the coefﬁcients generated according to equation
4.36. One can see that the histogram of the original image in
Figure 4.18(A) has nothing special about it; it has a more or less
random shape. On the other hand, one can see that the histo-
gram of the coefﬁcients c(m, n) has a well-deﬁned shape,
tending to a Laplacian distribution. One can also see that indeed
the small differences c(m, n) are much more likely than the
smaller differences, conﬁrming the redundancy of the LENA
