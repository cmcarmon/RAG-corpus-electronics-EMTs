Section 11.4, Planar Antennas, presents a unique and prac-
tical class of antennas for application at microwave- and milli-
meter-wave frequencies. These antennas, often referred to as
printed antennas, are completely compatible with many types
of high-frequency transmission lines and can be constructed
directly on a printed circuit board. Their low cost, ease of
fabrication, and control over their radiation properties makes
these antennas very useful in commercial wireless systems at
these frequencies. Four types of planar antennas are discussed,
including the patch antenna, slot antenna, the tapered slot
antenna (TSA), and the newly developed quasi-Yagiantenna.
The section concludes with an antenna selection guide, con-
taining geometry and radiation characteristics of a wide variety
of planar antennas in one compact table for easy reference.
