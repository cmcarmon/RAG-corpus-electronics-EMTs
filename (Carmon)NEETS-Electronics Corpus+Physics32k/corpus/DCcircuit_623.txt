voltage and resistance have decreased, but without knowing how much each one has changed,
we canâ€™t use the I=E/R formula to qualitatively determine the resulting change in current.
However, we can still apply the rules of series and parallel circuits horizontally. We know that
the current through the R1//R2 parallel combination has increased, and we also know that the
current through R1 has decreased. One of the rules of parallel circuits is that total current is
equal to the sum of the individual branch currents. In this case, the current through R1//R2 is
equal to the current through R1 added to the current through R2. If current through R1//R2 has
increased while current through R1 has decreased, current through R2 must have increased:
