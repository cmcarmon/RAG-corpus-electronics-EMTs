There are a number of mechanical tests that have been developed to determine the strength of polymeric sheet materials. Many have been adopted for use in evaluating geomembranes. They represent both quality control and design, i.e., index versus performance tests.
tensile strength and elongation (index, wide width, axisymmetric, and seams)
tear resistance
impact resistance
puncture resistance
interface shear strength
anchorage strength
stress cracking (constant load and single point).
