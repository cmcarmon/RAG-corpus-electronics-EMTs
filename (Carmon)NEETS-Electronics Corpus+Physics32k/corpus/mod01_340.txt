When the cell is fully discharged it will be as shown in figure 2-3 view C. The anode and cathode 
retain some lead peroxide and sponge lead but the amounts of lead sulfate in each is maximum. The 
electrolyte has a minimum amount of sulfuric acid. With this condition no further chemical action can 
take place within the cell.
