 = 0), it can be expressed in terms
V),
of a magnetic vector potential 
where V is the electric scalar potential. Neither A nor V is completely deﬁned since the gradient of an arbitrary
scalar  function  can  be  added  to  A  and  the  time  derivative  of  the  same  function  can  be  subtracted  from  V
without  affecting  the  physical  quantities  E  and  B.  These  changes  to A  and V  are  the  gauge  transformations,
and  uniqueness  is  usually  ensured  by  specifying  the  divergence  of  A  and  sufﬁcient  boundary  conditions.  If
