Disturbances  in  the  orderly  timing  of  the  cardiac  cycle  are  elegantly  displayed  by  the  ECG.  For  example,
each  atrial  excitation  may  not  be  delivered  to  the  AV  node.  AV  block  exists  when  there  is  less  than  a  1/1
correspondence between the P and QRS complexes (Fig. 113.13).
