A run-flat tire is a pneumatic vehicle tire that is designed to resist the effects of deflation when punctured, and to enable the vehicle to continue to be driven at reduced speeds - under 56 mph (90 km/h)-, and for limited distances - generally between 10 mi (16 km) to 50 mi (80 km), depending on the type of tire.
