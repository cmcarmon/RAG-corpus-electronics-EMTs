Nano-suction is a technology that uses vacuum, negative fluid pressure and millions of nano-sized suction cups to securely adhere any object to a flat non-porous surface. When the nano-suction object is pressed against a flat surface, millions of miniature suction cups create a large vacuum, generating a strong suction force that can hold a tremendous amount of weight. The nature of the technology allows easy removal without residue, and makes it reusable.
