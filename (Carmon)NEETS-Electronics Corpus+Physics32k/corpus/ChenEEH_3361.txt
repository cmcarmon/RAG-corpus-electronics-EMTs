The primary objective of power system operation is delivering
power to consumers meeting strict tolerances on voltage mag-
nitude and frequency. Accordingly,
the operation control
problems naturally divide into the control of voltage magni-
tudes or the voltage control issues and the control of system
frequency or the frequency control problems. Because a power
system is an interconnected, large system spread over a geo-
graphically wide network, operation of the large system is
complex. The controls are built to exploit the inherent time-
scale and structural properties of the system. In this chapter,
we focus on the frequency control problem as an example
of power system controls. In fact, the automatic frequency
control in the North American electric power grid was the
Ô¨Årst instance of a successful implementation of a large-scale
network-based control scheme.
