It is during encapsulation that the ZnS shell plays an especially important role, in that it helps prevent the agglomeration of CdSe particles that had no shell by occupying the previously-mentioned bonds on the dotâ€™s surface; however, clumping can still occur through secondary forces that arise from common hydrophobicity. This can result in multiple particles within each micelle, which may negatively impact overall resolution. For this reason multiple combinations of PEG chain length and particle diameter are necessary to achieve optimal imaging properties.
