Problem 5.25: Detective Work
The signal x (n) equals δ (n) − δ (n − 1).
(a) Find the length-8 DFT (discrete Fourier transform) of this signal.
(b) You are told that when x (n) served as the input to a linear FIR (ﬁnite impulse response) ﬁlter, the
output was y (n) = δ (n) − δ (n − 1) + 2δ (n − 2). Is this statement true? If so, indicate why and ﬁnd
the system’s unit sample response; if not, show why not.
