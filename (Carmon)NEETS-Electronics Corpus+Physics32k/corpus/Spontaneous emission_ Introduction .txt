If a light source ('the atom') is in an excited state with energy

{\displaystyle E_{2}}
, it may spontaneously decay to a lower lying level (e.g., the ground state) with energy




E

{\displaystyle E_{1}}
, releasing the difference in energy between the two states as a photon. The photon will have angular frequency

{\displaystyle \omega }
and an energy
