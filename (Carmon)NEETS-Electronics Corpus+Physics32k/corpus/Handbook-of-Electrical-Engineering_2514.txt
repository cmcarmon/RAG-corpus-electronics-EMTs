This is one example of a common-emitter (CE) circuit, so-called because the emitter is the common terminal
for  both  base  and  collector  currents.  The  behavior  of  the  transistor  in  such  a  circuit  may  be  illustrated  by
superimposing a load line on the output characteristics of the transistor, as shown in Fig. 24.28.
