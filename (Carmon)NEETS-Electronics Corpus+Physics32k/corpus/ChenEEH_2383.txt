Speciﬁcally, this discussion analyzes basic antenna param-
eters under four operating conditions: (1) antenna as a trans-
mitter, (2) antenna as a receiver, (3) antenna in a transmit–
receive communication link, and (4) antenna as a scatterer. For
related studies on fundamental antenna parameters or for
information on more advanced concepts of antenna theory,
one may refer to some of the standard antenna books such as
those by Balanis (1997), Kraus and Fleisch (1999), Kraus
(1950), Jasik (1961), Collin and Zucker (1969), and Schelkun-
off and Friis (1952).
