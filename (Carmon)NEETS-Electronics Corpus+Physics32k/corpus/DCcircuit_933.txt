When possible, the full-bridge conÔ¨Åguration is the best to use. This is true not only because
it is more sensitive than the others, but because it is linear while the others are not. Quarter-
bridge and half-bridge circuits provide an output (imbalance) signal that is only approximately
proportional to applied strain gauge force. Linearity, or proportionality, of these bridge circuits
is best when the amount of resistance change due to applied force is very small compared to the
nominal resistance of the gauge(s). With a full-bridge, however, the output voltage is directly
proportional to applied force, with no approximation (provided that the change in resistance
caused by the applied force is equal for all four strain gauges!).
