Traces on a printed circuit board can also develop 
defects. If a trace becomes shorted to another trace 
through soldering, the circuit may not work or com-
ponents may be damagedâ€”or worse, the board may 
catch fire. If a trace opens, it acts like a resistor that 
has opened and the circuit will not work or will only 
partially work.
