sented as the pixels having gray level within predetermined
ranges. Depending on the application, we may know the shape
of one object (e.g., the bolt) and perform pattern matching to
determine the position of the bolt on the image. One could
also use mathematical morphology to compute the Euler
number to count the ‘‘number of holes’’ of each object and
consider the nuts as the ones having just one hole. Then, the
inner perimeter of the nuts can be determined to check
whether they comply to manufacturing speciﬁcations. By
closely observing the bolt, one can notice that it is composed
of several different regions (e.g., its head clearly belongs to a
region different from its body). Therefore, after the segmenta-
tion algorithm, one should perform region labeling to deter-
mine which regions should be united to compose the bolt.
Once having established that the image is composed of three
objects,
image classiﬁcation and understanding techniques
should be used to ﬁgure out what kind of objects they are. In
this case, one must determine that there are two nuts and one
bolt from the data extracted in previous steps. Finally, a robot
could use this information, extracted automatically, to screw
the bolt into the round nut.
