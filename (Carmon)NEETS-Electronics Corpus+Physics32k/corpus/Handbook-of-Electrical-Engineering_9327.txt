Similarly, because their return values are clearly identiﬁed, functions that do not change their parameters
are preferred over those that do and over procedures. As functions are not always appropriate, a programmer
choosing to use a procedure should aid the reader’s comprehension by adopting some documented standard
of consistently changing either the procedure’s ﬁrst or last parameter(s).
