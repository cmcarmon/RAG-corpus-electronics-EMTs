Estimating the Model Order and Gain
In practice, the ‘‘true’’ order of the system of equation 3.6 is
unknown. A generally accepted rule of thumb is to allocate one
pole pair per kilohertz of Nyquist bandwidth; then, if the
segment is voiced, one can add an additional four or ﬁve
(whichever makes the total even) (Markel and Gray, 1976).
Since the order of the model would ordinarily not be changed
from frame to frame, the ‘‘extra’’ four or ﬁve would be in-
cluded for unvoiced speech frames. Hence, we choose:
