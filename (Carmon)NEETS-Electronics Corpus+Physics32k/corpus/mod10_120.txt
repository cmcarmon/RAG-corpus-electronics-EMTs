An ECHO is the reflection of the original sound wave as it bounces off a distant surface. Just as a
rubber ball bounces back when it is thrown against a hard surface, sound waves also bounce off most
surfaces. As you have learned from the study of the law of conservation of energy, a rubber ball never
bounces back with as much energy as the initial bounce. Similarly, a reflected sound wave is not as loud
as the original sound wave. In both cases, some of the energy is absorbed by the reflecting surface. Only a
portion of the original sound is reflected, and only a portion of the reflected sound returns to the listener.
For this reason, an echo is never as loud as the original sound.
