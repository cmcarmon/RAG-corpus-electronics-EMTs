â€¢ Most important of all is portability. To move any program to a different computer, you must generate
machine  code  for  that  new  platform. With  a  program  in  a  HLL,  a  new  platform  is  almost  free;  all  it
requires is another pass through the compiler for the target platform. With assembly code, you are back
to square one. Assembly code is unique to the platform.
