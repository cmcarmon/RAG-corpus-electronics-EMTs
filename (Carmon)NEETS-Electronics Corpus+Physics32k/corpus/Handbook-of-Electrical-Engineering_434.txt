the 2-trees in the gain expression by the k-tree approach correspond (one-to-one) to the uncanceled terms in
the  ﬁnal  expressions  of  the  gain  by  the  ﬂowgraph  techniques.  Finally,  it  should  be  obvious  that  the  k-tree
approach depends upon the knowledge of the graph of a given network. Thus, if in a network problem only
the system of (loop or node) equations is given and the network is not known, or more generally, if a system
is characterized by a block diagram or a system of equations, the k-tree approach cannot be applied and one
must resort to the ﬂowgraph techniques between the two approaches.
