value E[X(t)] = m(t) at time t, and autocorrelation function RXX(t, t + t) = E[X(t)X(t + t)] at times t and t +
t,  the  correlation  of  two  rv’s  at  two  times  offset  by  t. When  m(t)  =  0  for  all  t,  the  autocorrelation  function
equals the autocovariance function CXX(t, t + t) = E[(X(t) – m(t))(X(t + t) – m(t + t))].
