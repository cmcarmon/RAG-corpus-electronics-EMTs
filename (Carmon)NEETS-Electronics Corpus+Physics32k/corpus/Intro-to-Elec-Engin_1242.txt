13.2.15 A three-phase, 220-V, 60-Hz, four-pole, wye-
connected induction motor has a per-phase stator
resistance of 0.5 . The following no-load and
blocked rotor test data on the motor are given:
• No-load test: line-to-line voltage 220 V, total
input power 600 W, of which 200 W is the
friction and windage loss, and line current 3 A
• Blocked-rotor test: line-to-line voltage 35 V,
total input power 720 W, and line current 15 A
