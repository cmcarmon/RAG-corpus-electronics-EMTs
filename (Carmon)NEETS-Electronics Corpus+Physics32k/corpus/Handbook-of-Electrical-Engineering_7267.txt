Two basic technologies characterize the wireless LANs currently available. Infrared (IR) systems use a part
of the electromagnetic spectrum just below visible light as a transmission medium. IR, being light, travels in
a  straight,  or  line-of-sight,  path.  It  is  blocked  by  opaque  objects  and  reï¬‚ects  well  only  off  hard,  mirror-like
surfaces.  This  factor  stands  as  a  serious  obstacle  to  IR  systems  for  applications  other  than  in  open  working
environments.
