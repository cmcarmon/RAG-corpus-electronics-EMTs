Flowcode 
 
Flowcode 
a  novel 
programming system that is designed to allow those 
new  to  PIC  programming  to  develop  complete 
applications  with  little  or  no  knowledge  of  any 
higher  level  languages.  However  it  is  possible  to 
embed  code  written 
into 
Flowcode programs.   
  Programs written in C and Assembly code can be  
easily embedded in Flowcode. This will allow you 
to  incorporate  more  complex  and  sophisticated   
code  in  applications  where  this  might  become 
necessary.  Note  however  that  the  embedded  code 
cannot  be  checked  or  simulated  by  Flowcode  but 
instead it will be passed on to the C compiler when 
the flowchart is compiled. It is therefore important 
to  verify  that  the  C  code  entered  is  correct,  as 
syntax  errors  will  cause  the  compilation  of  the 
whole flowchart to fail.  
  To  access  Flowcode  variables,  macro  functions
