Again, this very Quality Factor was introduced in Chapter 12 (Equations 12.65
and 12.66) from a quite different point of view. There, in the time domain view,
Q indicated the length of time for which the circuit would ‘‘ring’’ when excited
by an input such as a step. If we know the quality factor Q and the frequency
ωo, we can derive the bandwidth as:
