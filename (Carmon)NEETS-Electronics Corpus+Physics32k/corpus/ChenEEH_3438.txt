Step 1: Settings for Relay R3
The relay has to operate for all currents above 156 A. For
reliability, one-third of the minimum fault current is selected.
This yields a primary fault current of 156/3 ¼ 52 A. Based on
this, a CT ratio of 50/5 ¼ 10 is selected. This yields a secondary
current of 52/10 ¼ 5.2 A. To match this, the relay tap (pick-up
value) is selected to be 5.0 A. To ensure the fastest tripping for
faults downstream from relay R3, the time dial of 0.05 is
selected (see Figure 9.11).
