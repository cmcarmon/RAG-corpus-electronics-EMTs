A type of chemical bond of particular interest to our study of batteries is the so-called ionic
bond, and it differs from the covalent bond in that one atom of the molecule possesses an excess
of electrons while another atom lacks electrons, the bonds between them being a result of the
electrostatic attraction between the two unlike charges. When ionic bonds are formed from
neutral atoms, there is a transfer of electrons between the positively and negatively charged
atoms. An atom that gains an excess of electrons is said to be reduced; an atom with a deﬁ-
ciency of electrons is said to be oxidized. A mnemonic to help remember the deﬁnitions is OIL
RIG (oxidized is less; reduced is gained). It is important to note that molecules will often con-
tain both ionic and covalent bonds. Sodium hydroxide (lye, NaOH) has an ionic bond between
the sodium atom (positive) and the hydroxyl ion (negative). The hydroxyl ion has a covalent
bond (shown as a bar) between the hydrogen and oxygen atoms:
