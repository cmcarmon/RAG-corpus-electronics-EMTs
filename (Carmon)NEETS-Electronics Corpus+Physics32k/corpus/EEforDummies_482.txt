The current induced in the coil reduces the strength of the expanding mag-
netic field a bit. As the source current keeps rising, the magnetic field contin-
ues to expand (but more and more slowly), and current opposing the source 
current continues to be induced (but it gets smaller and smaller). The cycle 
continues, until finally the overall current settles down to a steady DC. When 
current reaches a steady level, the magnetic field no longer changes â€” and 
the inductor ceases to affect the current in the circuit.
