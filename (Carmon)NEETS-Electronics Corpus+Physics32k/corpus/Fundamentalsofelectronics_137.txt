Since resistors are positive-valued, resistors always dissipate power. But where does a resistor’s power
go? By Conversation of Power, the dissipated power must be absorbed somewhere. The answer is not
directly predicted by circuit theory, but is by physics. Current ﬂowing through a resistor makes it hot; its
power is dissipated by heat.
