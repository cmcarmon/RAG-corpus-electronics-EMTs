The harmonics not effectively developed across the capacitor must be developed across the resistor 
to satisfy Kirchhoff's voltage law. Note the pattern of the voltage waveforms across the resistor and 
capacitor. If the waveforms across both the resistor and the capacitor were added graphically, the resultant 
would be an exact duplication of the input square wave.
