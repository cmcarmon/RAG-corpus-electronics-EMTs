An	integrated	circuit	(or	IC)	is	alternatively	called	a	microchip	or	a	chip,	due	to	its
size.	It	works	depending	on	a	particular	signal	level.	One	example	is	the	integrated
circuit	that	enables	a	computer	to	perform	a	multitude	of	tasks;	instead	of	loading	a
computer’s	structure	with	a	large	circuit,	it	comes	to	the	rescue.
In	most	cases,	an	integrated	circuit	operates	at	little	defined	states.	Compared	to
the	normal	circuit	whose	operations	are	distributed	over	continuous	amplitudes,	it
can	 function	 within	 a	 small	 network;	 the	 normal	 circuit	 may	 sometimes	 fail	 to
work	with	only	minor	amplitude	ranges.
Basically,	an	integrated	circuit	is	no	different	from	any	other	circuit;	its	power	can
astound	you,	yes,	but,	if	it	comes	down	to	describing	how	it	is,	it’s	simply	a	circuit
that	has	been	reduced	so	it	can	fit	inside	a	chip.
