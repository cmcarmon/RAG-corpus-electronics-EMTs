Power transformers are energy storage devices that experience
transient behavior of the terminal conditions when the stored
energy is abruptly changed. Such conditions may be seen
during transformer energization, energization of a parallel
transformer, removal of a nearby external fault, and a sudden
increase in the terminal voltage. The following is a discussion
of the mentioned phenomena and the impact they have on the
terminal currents.
