2. An orthogonality exists between an incident wave and
a reï¬‚ected wave in a lossless medium (both are either
TEz or TMz), provided the wave number component kz
of the two waves is real. The two waves are orthogonal
in the sense that the time-average power density in the
z direction, ReSz, is the sum of the two time-average
power densities ReS1z and ReS2z.
