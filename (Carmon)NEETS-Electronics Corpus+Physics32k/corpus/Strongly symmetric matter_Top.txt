Strongly symmetric matter: If the predictions of supersymmetry and, more so, string theory are correct, then during the time of the Planck Epoch (10−43 seconds after the Big Bang) all four fundamental forces were of equal strength and united into a single fundamental force. However, shortly thereafter, during the grand unification epoch (10−33 seconds after the Big Bang) gravity began to separate from the other three forces of electromagnetism, the strong, and weak nuclear force. After gravity had separated, the strong nuclear force was quick to follow and separated itself from the electroweak force, ending the epoch. The phrase 'strongly symmetric matter' refers to the united forces present during the Planck Epoch.
