A control engineer often describes a system through the use of block diagrams of different kinds. To bypass
the bottleneck between theoretical design and actual real-time implementation, systems which took engineering
block diagrams and automatically converted them into simulation and/or real-time code started to emerge in
the  middle  of  the  1980s. As  an  early  example,  already  in  1984  General  Electric  decided  to  develop  a  block-
diagram-based tool with automatic code generation capabilities. This program allowed draftspersons to enter
control  block  diagrams  and  automatically  convert  the  functionality  of  these  diagrams  into  real-time  code.
Although it used limited graphics, this GE-Internal “Autocode” program successfully produced code at 50% of
the cost of traditionally generated code, primarily due to error reduction of not hand coding. This reduction
of  costs  provided  the  evidence  that  automatic  translation  of  block  diagrams  is  both  feasible  and  desirable.
However, due to advances in both computer graphics and code-generation techniques, the ﬁrst tool was obsolete
by the late 1980s. In recent years, several commercial block-diagram-based tools have become available. These
