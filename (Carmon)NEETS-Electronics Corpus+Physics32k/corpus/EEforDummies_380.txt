A capacitor can store electrical energy for hours on end. You’d be wise to 
make sure a capacitor is discharged before handling it, lest it discharges 
through you. To discharge a capacitor, carefully place a small incandescent 
bulb across its terminals, using insulated alligator clips (refer to Chapter 2) 
to make the connection. If the bulb lights up, you know the capacitor was 
charged, and the light should dim and go out in a few seconds as the capacitor 
discharges. If you don’t have a bulb handy, place a 1 MΩ 1 W resistor across 
the terminals and wait at least 30 seconds. (Refer to Chapter 16 for details.)
