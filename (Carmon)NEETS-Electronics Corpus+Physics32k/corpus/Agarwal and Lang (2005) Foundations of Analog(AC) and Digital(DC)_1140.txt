Now, assuming that the input signal is a small-signal sinusoid superimposed
on the DC offset of 2.2 V, let us determine the maximum valid peak-to-peak
swing for the sinusoid. We refer back to Section 7.6.2 to answer this question.
From Section 7.6.2, we know that under the saturation discipline, the maximum
For the given parameters, the valid range for input voltages is 1 V â†’
2.32 V. In other words, as discussed in Section 7.6.2, input voltages under 1 V
will result in cutoff region operation of the MOSFET, while those over 2.32 V
will result in triode region operation. Operation in either the cutoff region or
the triode region will result in severe signal distortion.
