The CW radar can measure the Doppler frequency of the
target, but it cannot measure the target range. The fre-
quency-modulated CW radar (FM–CW) can measure both
the range and Doppler frequency of the target. In the FM–CW
radar, the transmitted frequency changed as a function of time
in a known manner.
