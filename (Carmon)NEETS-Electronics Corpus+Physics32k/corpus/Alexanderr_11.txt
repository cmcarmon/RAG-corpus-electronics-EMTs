1.2
As electrical engineers, we deal with measurable quantities. Our mea-
surement, however, must be communicated in a standard language that
virtually  all  professionals  can  understand,  irrespective  of  the  country
where the measurement is conducted. Such an international measurement
language  is  the  International  System  of  Units  (SI),  adopted  by  the
General Conference on Weights and Measures in 1960. In this system,
there are seven principal units from which the units of all other phys-
ical  quantities  can  be  derived.  Table  1.1  shows  the  six  units  and  one
derived unit that are relevant to this text. The SI units are used through-
out this text.
