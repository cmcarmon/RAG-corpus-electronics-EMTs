	
Different	communities	of	hackers	host	events	that	give	light	to	those	who	are	passionate	in
circuitry.
One	community,	Artisan	Asylum,	hosts	a	circuit	hacking	night	once	a	week.	In	the
gathering,	circuit	engineering	fellows	–	from	beginners	to	professionals,	come	together	to
discuss	various	concepts	in	circuitry	and	electronics.	There,	like-minded	individuals	share
their	love	for	circuitry	and	talk	about	their	favorite	projects,	and	basically,	anything	in	the
world	of	circuitry.
Moreover,	Artisan	Asylum’s	circuit	hacking	night	provides	great	learning	opportunities
for	circuit	hacking	enthusiasts.	It	presents	lessons	on	how	to	solder,	how	to	use	particular
computer	programs,	and	how	to	modify	a	circuit	to	function	as	desired.	Apart	from
teaching	individuals	the	basics	and	advanced	techniques	on	how	to	hack	a	circuit,	and
have	it	work	as	desired,	the	community	encourages	the	attendees	to	think	outside	of	the
box	and	come	up	with	brilliant	and	innovative	ideas.
