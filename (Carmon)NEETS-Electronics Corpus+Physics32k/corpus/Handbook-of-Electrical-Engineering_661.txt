Note  that  all  RF  signals  and  the  carrier  frequency  have  been  removed  from  Fig.  5.39.  Consequently,  the
sampling  frequency  required  for  computer  simulations  is  determined  exclusively  by  the  slowly-varying  low-
pass signals. All noise performance curves shown in this chapter section have been determined using low-pass
equivalent models derived in this way.
