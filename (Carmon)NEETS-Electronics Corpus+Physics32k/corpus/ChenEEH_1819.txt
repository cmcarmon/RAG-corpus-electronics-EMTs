. Boundary node: Boundary nodes are the gatekeepers of
the DS domain. A boundary node is the ﬁrst (or last)
node that a packet can encounter when entering (or
exiting) a DS domain. It performs certain edge functions
like admission control, packet classiﬁcation, and trafﬁc
conditioning. The admission control algorithm limits the
number of ﬂows that are admitted into the DiffServ
domain and is distributed in nature. For example, in the
simplest case, the admission control algorithm may main-
tain a central data structure that contains the current
status of all links in the DS domain. When a ﬂow is
considered for admission, the corresponding boundary
node might check this data structure to verify if all the
links of the ﬂow path can satisfy the requested QoS. Every
packet belonging to an admitted ﬂow and arriving into
the DS domain is classiﬁed and marked as belonging to
one of the service classes called behavior aggregates in
DiffServ terminology. Each such behavior aggregate is
assigned a distinct 8-bit code word, called the DS code
point. Packet marking is achieved by updating the TOS
ﬁeld in the packet’s IP header with the appropriate DS
code point. Boundary nodes also enforce trafﬁc condi-
tioning agreements (TCA) between their own DS domain
and other connected domains, if any.
