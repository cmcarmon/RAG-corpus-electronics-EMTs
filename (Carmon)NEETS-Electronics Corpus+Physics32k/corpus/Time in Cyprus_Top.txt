Time in Cyprus is given by Eastern European Time (EET) (UTC+02:00) or Eastern European Summer Time (EEST) (UTC+03:00) during the summer.
In 2016, Northern Cyprus had different time to Southern Cyprus during the winter, meaning it followed Turkey which starting summer 2016 has UTC+3 all year around. From autumn 2017 it has same time as Southern Cyprus, that means DST during summer but not winter. That is a different time compared to Turkey during the winter.
