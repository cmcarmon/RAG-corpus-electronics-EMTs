Double lace is applied in a manner similar to single lace, except that it is started with a telephone 
hitch and is double throughout the length of the lacing (figure 2-43). Both double and single lace may be 
ended by forming a loop from a separate length of cord and using it to pull the end of the lacing back 
underneath a serving of approximately eight turns (figure 2-44). An alternate method of ending the lacing 
is illustrated in figure 2-45. This method can also be used for either single- or double-cord lacing. Another 
method is by using a marling hitch as a lock stitch (figure 2-46) to prevent slippage. This procedure will 
also prevent unraveling should a break occur to the lacing.
