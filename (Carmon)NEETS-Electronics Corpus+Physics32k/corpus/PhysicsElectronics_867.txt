The gated charge-to-voltage ampliﬁer is designed speciﬁcally as an integrating ampliﬁer to
measure the area under a narrow pulse.
Its capacitor must be discharged before a new
sample can be taken. If the initial charge on the capacitor is zero, then the output voltage
from the ampliﬁer follows the gate signal. This sampling ampliﬁer is normally used with
pulsed signals when the area under the signal is of primary interest. The entire signal is
integrated and the output is insensitive to the details of the signal shape.
