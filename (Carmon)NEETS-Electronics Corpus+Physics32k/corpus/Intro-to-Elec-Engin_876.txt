The magnetic material determines the size of the equipment, its capabilities, and the lim-
itations on its performance. The transformer, although not an energy-conversion device, is an
important auxiliary in the transfer and conversion of electric energy. Practically all transformers
and electric machinery utilize magnetic material for shaping the magnetic ﬁelds which act as the
medium for transferring and converting energy. Transformers are found in various applications,
such as radio, television, and electric power transmission and distribution circuits. Other devices,
such as circuit breakers, automatic switches, and relays, also require the presence of a conﬁned
magnetic ﬁeld for their proper operation.
