More down to earth, but equally inaccessible to measurement, is strain on the chain belt of an earth mover.
Too light a chain will quickly fail from fatigue caused by the alternating stresses imposed by the full and empty
buckets it transports. Measurements made under actual operating conditions of the earth hoist mean attaching
strain gauges to a chain traveling at 500 ft per minute, subjecting them to violent shock and vibration. On this
kind  of  moving  equipment,  slip  rings  and  wire-link  remote  measurements  will  not  work.  Here  again,  radio
telemetry is now providing the dynamic measurements needed to test the earth-moving equipment at work.
A transducer and a small, rugged transmitter are attached to points along the chain—strain varies from link
to link, depending on the proximity to the bucket—until the most vulnerable part of the chain is found. It is
preferable  to  use  several  transducers  and  multiple-channel  telemetry  equipment  for  such  measurements  to
simplify correlation between load and the resulting strain at various links.
