All of the TPV converters described above present some challenge in reaching a cost target of about $1 per
watt. In the case of silicon, the power densities are quite small. For the GaSb or GaInAs devices, the cost of the
substrate  (GaSb  or  InP)  and  device  processing  leaves  little  margin.  Thus,  as  in  solar  photovoltaics,  there  is
growing research interest in thin-Ô¨Ålm technologies and in low-cost substrate alternatives.
