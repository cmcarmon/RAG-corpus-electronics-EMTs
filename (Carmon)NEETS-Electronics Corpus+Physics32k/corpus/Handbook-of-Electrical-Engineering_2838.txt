The considerations noted here as part of the design process are neither all-encompassing, nor in sufﬁcient
detail for a true SMT novice to adequately deal with all the issues involved in the process. They are intended
to guide an engineer through the process, allowing him/her to access more detailed information as necessary.
General references are noted at the end of this chapter, and speciﬁc references will be noted as applicable. In

beginner  and  the  experienced  SMT  engineer.  Although  these  guidelines  are  noted  as  “steps”,  they  are  not
necessarily in an absolute order, and may require several iterations back-and-forth among the steps to result
in a ﬁnal satisfactory process and product.
