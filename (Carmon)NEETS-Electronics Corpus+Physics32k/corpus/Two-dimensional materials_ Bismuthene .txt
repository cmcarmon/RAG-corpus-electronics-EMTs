Bismuthene, the two-dimensional allotrope of bismuth, was synthesized on silicon carbide in 2016 and is predicted to be a topological insulator. At first glance the system is similar to graphene, as the Bi atoms arrange in a honeycomb lattice. However the bandgap is as large as 800mV due to the large spin-orbit-coupling of the Bi atoms and their interaction with the substrate. Thus, room-temperature applications of the quantum spin Hall effect come into reach.
