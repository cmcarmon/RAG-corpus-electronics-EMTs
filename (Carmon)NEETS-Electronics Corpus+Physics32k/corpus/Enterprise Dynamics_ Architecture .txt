Enterprise Dynamics is an object-oriented simulation platform combined with an event-oriented approach. The user can select standard simulation objects (the so-called 'Atoms'), in which the behavior of their real life equivalents is captured, from a library and create a model by clicking and dragging the objects into the model space. For each simulation object, parameters can be altered to change its behavior.
