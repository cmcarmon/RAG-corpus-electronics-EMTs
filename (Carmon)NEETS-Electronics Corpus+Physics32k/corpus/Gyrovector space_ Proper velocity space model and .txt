A proper velocity space model of hyperbolic geometry is given by proper velocities with vector addition given by the proper velocity addition formula:

u



{\displaystyle \mathbf {u} \oplus _{U}\mathbf {v} =\mathbf {u} +\mathbf {v} +\left\{{\frac {\beta _{\mathbf {u} }}{1+\beta _{\mathbf {u} }}}{\frac {\mathbf {u} \cdot \mathbf {v} }{c^{2}}}+{\frac {1-\beta _{\mathbf {v} }}{\beta _{\mathbf {v} }}}\right\}\mathbf {u} }

where

{\displaystyle \beta _{\mathbf {w} }={\frac {1}{\sqrt {1+{\frac {|\mathbf {w} |^{2}}{c^{2}}}}}}}

This formula provides a model that uses a whole space compared to other models of hyperbolic geometry which use discs or half-planes.
