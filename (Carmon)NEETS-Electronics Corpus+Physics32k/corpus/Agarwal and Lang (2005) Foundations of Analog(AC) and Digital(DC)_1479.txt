The intuitive method discussed in Section 10.3 applies equally well for impulse
responses. Shown in Figure 10.39a is our familiar parallel source-resistor-
capacitor circuit from Figure 10.2a. Suppose that the current input is an impulse
of area Q that is applied at t = 0 as shown in Figure 10.39b. Assume we wish
to find the capacitor voltage vC.
