INSERTION LOSS MEASUREMENTS are performed by injecting a signal of a known amplitude
into a transmission line and then monitoring the signal at the far end of the cable with a power meter.
Loss measurements must be taken at various frequencies to determine if the transmission line is good
across its frequency range.
