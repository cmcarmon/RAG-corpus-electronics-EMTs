If an electronic device with a long coaxial aerial lead is disturbed by a signal from a HF transmitter then the braid of the coaxial should be considered as a path of entry of RF into the affected device. One additional feature which can assist a braid breaker is the use of an RF ground, a quarter wavelength of wire will act as an RF ground even when it goes nowhere. This is because the quarterwave transforms the infinite impedance into a zero impedance. The quarterwave length of wire can be regarded as an artificial earth for RF purposes.
By adding a braid-breaker filter to the system common mode signals will be attenuated while unbalanced signals will be allowed to pass unhindered. This is also something which is added to long leads in military electronic equipment which is intended to continue to function even after being subjected to a nuclear electromagnetic pulse (EMP) and also would increase the likelihood of an electronic device surviving a nearby lightning strike (direct lightning hits are very hard to protect against).
For UHF TV a wide range of good designs exist, these include a ferrite RF choke on the downlead and some networks of passive components.
