When unbound negatively charged electrons move through a crystal, as shown in Figure
7.1.1(a), electrical conduction in semiconductors can take place with a direction of current opposite
to the direction of movement of the electrons. When a bound electron that should be present in the
valence bond is missing, the vacancy that arises is known as a hole. Holes are positively charged
particles with a charge equal in magnitude to that of the electron. Mobile positively charged holes
can also give rise to a current, as shown in Figure 7.1.1(b), with the direction of current in the
same direction as the movement of holes. Both holes and unbound electrons are known as charge
carriers, or simply carriers.
