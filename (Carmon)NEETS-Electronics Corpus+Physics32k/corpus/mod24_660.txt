The lasing threshold is the lowest drive current level at which the output of the laser results primarily
from stimulated emission rather than spontaneous emission. Figure 6-4 illustrates the transition from
spontaneous emission to stimulated emission by plotting the relative optical output power and input drive
current of a semiconductor laser diode. The lowest current at which stimulated emission exceeds
spontaneous emission is the threshold current. Before the threshold current is reached, the optical output
power increases only slightly with small increases in drive current. However, after the threshold current is
reached, the optical output power increases significantly with small changes in drive currents.
