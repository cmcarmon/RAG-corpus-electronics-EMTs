Parallel systems are emerging as the power of computer systems is extended by using multiple units. The
may correspond to anything from a rudimentary processor, such as a “smart word” in a massively
term 
parallel “ﬁne grain” architecture, to a full-scale computer, in a coarse-grain parallel system with a few tens of
parallel units. Chapter 95 discusses the hardware and software approaches to a wide variety of parallel systems.
Operating  systems,  which  are  described  in  the  next  chapter,  turn  a  “raw”  computer  into  an  instrument
capable of performing useful, low-level tasks, such as creating a ﬁle or starting a process corresponding to an
algorithm, or transferring its output to a device such as a printer, which may be busy with other tasks.
