Allocating more or less memories has an effect on the chip
area and the energy consumption of the memory architecture
as shown in Figure 2.23 for single-port memories. With multi-
port memories, the number of possibilities becomes even
much larger, but that will be left out of this discussion. Large
memories consume more energy per access than small mem-
ories due to the longer word- and bit-lines. Therefore, the
energy consumed by a single large memory containing all the
data is much greater than the energy consumed when the data
is distributed over several smaller memories. The area of the
one-memory solution is also often higher when different
arrays have different bit widths. For example, when a 6-bit
and an 8-bit array are stored in the same memory, two bits are
unused for every 6-bit word. By storing the arrays in different
memories, one six-bits wide and the other eight bits wide, this
overhead can be avoided. Note that the steepness of the curves
heavily depends on the particular application and also on the
memory library.
