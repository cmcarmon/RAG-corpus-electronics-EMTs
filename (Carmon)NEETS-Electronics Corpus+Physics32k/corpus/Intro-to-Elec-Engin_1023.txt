The energy-conversion process involves an interchange between electric and mechanical
energy via the stored energy in the magnetic ﬁeld. This stored energy, which can be determined
for any conﬁguration of the system, is a state function deﬁned solely by functional relationships
between variables and the ﬁnal values of these variables. Thus, the energy method is a powerful
tool for determining the coupling forces of electromechanics.
