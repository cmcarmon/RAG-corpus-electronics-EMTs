In point of fact, at frequencies much less than fL , both conditions (1) and (2) eventually produce 12-dB/octave
roll-offs as the alternate “large” capacitors come into play at very low frequencies, but since the ampliﬁer will
not still have a useful gain at such frequencies, this is of little importance.
