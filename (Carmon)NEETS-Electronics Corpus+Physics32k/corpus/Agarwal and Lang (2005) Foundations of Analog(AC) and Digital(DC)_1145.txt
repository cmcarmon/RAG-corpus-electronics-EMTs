From Section 7.6.2, we know that under the saturation discipline, the max-
imum valid range for the input voltage of the second stage is VT → −1 +
√
1 + 2VSRK/RK + VT. Substituting the circuit parameters, the valid input
range for the second stage comes out to be 1 V → 2.32 V. Since VOA exceeds
the upper bound (2.8 V > 2.32 V), we conclude that the first stage cannot pro-
vide a valid input bias voltage for the second stage when the first stage input bias
is set at 2.2 V. We can correct this situation by increasing VI A, or by increasing
R for the first stage.
