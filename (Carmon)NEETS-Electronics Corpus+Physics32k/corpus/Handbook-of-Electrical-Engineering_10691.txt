• Radio systems (Section 109.5). They consist of a network of transmitters (sometimes also receivers)
on the ground or in satellites. A vehicle detects the transmissions and computes its position relative
to  the  known  positions  of  the  stations  in  the  navigation  coordinate  frame.  The  vehicle’s  velocity  is
measured from the Doppler shift of the transmissions or from a sequence of position measurements.
• Celestial systems (Section 109.6). They measure the elevation and azimuth of celestial bodies relative
to the land level and North. Electronic star sensors are used in special-purpose high-altitude aircraft
and in spacecraft. Manual celestial navigation was practiced at sea for millennia (see Bowditch).
