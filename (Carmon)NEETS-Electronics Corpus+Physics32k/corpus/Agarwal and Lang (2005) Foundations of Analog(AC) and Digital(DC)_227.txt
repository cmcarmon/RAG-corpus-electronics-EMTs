a battery, wires, and a lightbulb. The purpose of the original circuit was to
convert chemical energy stored in the battery into light. To do so, the battery
converted the chemical energy to electrical energy, the wires then guided the
electrical energy to the lightbulb, and the lightbulb converted at least some of
this electrical energy to light. Thus, the circuit in Figure 1.4 performed a very
primitive form of energy processing.
