EURECA researchers are currently involved in data taking and analysis for CRESST and EDELWEISS. In addition, there are various R&D activities under way associated with scaling up the detector technology to a 1-tonne scale. These include:
Cryogenics: EURECA will require a one tonne mass to be cooled to millikelvin temperature. This will be done using large scale cryogenic technology, as used to cool gravitational wave experiments and the 27 km LHC accelerator ring.
Scintillators: Research is being carried out to develop large radiopure absorber crystals with good scintillation properties at low temperatures.
Detector readout: EURECA will require hardware and software to read-out the signals from 1000+ detector channels.
