A couple of interesting conclusions can be drawn from equa-
tion 4.35. The ﬁrst one is that, in regions of the frequency
plane where the signal-to-noise ratio is high SZZ(vx, vy)=
Suu(vx, vy) ! 0Þ, then equation 4.35 is equivalent to equation
4.20, the one for the pseudo-inverse ﬁlter. On the other hand,
in regions of the frequency plane where the signal-to-noise
ratio is low, then the Wiener ﬁlter depends on the power
spectral densities of both the noise and the input.
