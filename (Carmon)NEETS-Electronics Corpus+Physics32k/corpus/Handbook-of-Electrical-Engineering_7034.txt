Data compression is a process of ﬁnding the most efﬁcient representation of an information source in order
to minimize communication or storage. It often consists of two stages—the ﬁrst is the choice of a (probabilistic)
model for the source and the second is the design of an efﬁcient coding system for the model. In this section,
we will concentrate on the second aspect of the compression process, though we will touch on some common
sources and models in the last subsection.
