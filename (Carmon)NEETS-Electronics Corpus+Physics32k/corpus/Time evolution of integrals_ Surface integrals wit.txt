Suppose that S is a moving surface with a moving contour γ. Suppose that the velocity of the contour γ with respect to S is c. Then the rate of change of the time dependent integral:





∫

{\displaystyle \int _{S}F\,dS}

is

{\displaystyle {\frac {d}{dt}}\int _{S}F\,dS=\int _{S}{\frac {\delta F}{\delta t}}\,dS-\int _{S}CB_{\alpha }^{\alpha }F\,dS+\int _{\gamma }c\,d\gamma }

The last term captures the change in area due to annexation, as the figure on the right illustrates.
