Quantum knots is a branch of quantum mechanics that connects quantum computing with Knot theory.
While resisting the electron with Lorentz force it gets divided into three particles called Quasiparticle along with an amount of energy from the electron, These Quasiparticle tightly coupled by a knot like structure similar to the needle with thread, If an electron from other orbit interact with this knot make other knot, By applying the knot position the quantum states can be easily determined and it will solve the quantum superposition problems in quantum computing
