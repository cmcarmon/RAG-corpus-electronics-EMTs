decorrelation of the temporal information can lead to band-
width reduction without greatly affecting the video quality. As
shown in the previous section, spatial correlation between
image pixels is exploited to achieve still image compression.
Such a coding technique is called intraframe coding. If tem-
poral correlation is exploited as well, this is called interframe
coding.
