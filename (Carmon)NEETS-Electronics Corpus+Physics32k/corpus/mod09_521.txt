You can readily see that the formula comparison of the forward- and reverse-bias resistance 
conditions shows that a small amount of reverse current will flow during the limited portion of the input 
waveform. This small amount of reverse current will develop as the small positive voltage (0.09 volt) 
shown in figure 4-2 (T0 to T1 and T2 to T3). The actual amount of voltage developed will depend on the 
type of diode used. For the remainder of this chapter, we will use only idealized waveforms and disregard 
this small voltage.
