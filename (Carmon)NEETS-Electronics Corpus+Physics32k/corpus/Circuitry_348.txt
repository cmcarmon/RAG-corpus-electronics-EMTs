Phase shift 
 
Phase shift is the phase angle between the input and 
output  signal  voltages  measured  in  degrees.  The 
measurement is usually carried out in the mid-band 
where, for most amplifiers, the phase shift remains 
relatively  constant.  Note  also  that  conventional 
single-stage  transistor  amplifiers  provide  phase 
shifts of either 180° or 360°.
