Instead of wasting the slip power in the rotor circuit resistance, as was suggested by Scherbius,
we can feed it back to the ac mains by using a scheme known as a static Scherbius drive. The slip
power can be converted to mechanical power (with the aid of an auxiliary motor mounted on the
induction-motor shaft), which supplements the main motor power, thereby delivering the same
power to the load at different speeds, as in the Kramer drive.
