If a source of electric power is suddenly applied to an unmagnetized inductor, the inductor
will initially resist the ﬂow of electrons by dropping the full voltage of the source. As current
begins to increase, a stronger and stronger magnetic ﬁeld will be created, absorbing energy
from the source. Eventually the current reaches a maximum level, and stops increasing. At
this point, the inductor stops absorbing energy from the source, and is dropping minimum
voltage across its leads, while the current remains at a maximum level. As an inductor stores
more energy, its current level increases, while its voltage drop decreases. Note that this is
precisely the opposite of capacitor behavior, where the storage of energy results in an increased
voltage across the component! Whereas capacitors store their energy charge by maintaining
a static voltage, inductors maintain their energy ”charge” by maintaining a steady current
through the coil.
