In proof testing, the entire length of the ﬁber is subjected to a properly controlled proof stress. The proof
stress is based on the stresses likely to be encountered by the ﬁber during manufacture, storage, installation,
and service. The ﬁbers that survive the proof test are stored for further packaging into cables.
