This result is the Ô¨Årst of several equivalent circuit ideas: In many cases, a complicated circuit when viewed
from its terminals (the two places to which you might attach a source) appears to be a single circuit element
(at best) or a simple combination of elements at worst. Thus, the equivalent circuit for a series combination
of resistors is a single resistor having a resistance equal to the sum of its component resistances.
