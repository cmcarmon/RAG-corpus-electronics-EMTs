The momentum thickness, θ or δ2, is the distance by which a surface would have to be moved parallel to itself towards the reference plane in an inviscid fluid stream of velocity




u

0




{\displaystyle u_{0}}
to give the same total momentum as exists between the surface and the reference plane in a real fluid.
The definition of the momentum thickness for compressible flow is based on mass flow rate:

{\displaystyle \theta =\int _{0}^{\infty }{{\rho (y)u(y) \over \rho _{0}u_{o}}{\left(1-{u(y) \over u_{o}}\right)}}\,\mathrm {d} y}

The definition for incompressible flow can be based on volumetric flow rate, as the density is constant:

{\displaystyle \theta =\int _{0}^{\infty }{{u(y) \over u_{o}}{\left(1-{u(y) \over u_{o}}\right)}}\,\mathrm {d} y}

Where




ρ

0




{\displaystyle \rho _{0}}
and




u

0




{\displaystyle u_{0}}
are the density and velocity in the 'free stream' outside the boundary layer, and



y


{\displaystyle y}
is the coordinate normal to the wall.
For turbulent boundary layer calculations, the time averaged density and velocity at the edge of the boundary layer must be used. In the equations above,




ρ

0




{\displaystyle \rho _{0}}
and




u

0




{\displaystyle u_{0}}
are therefore replaced with




ρ

e




{\displaystyle \rho _{e}}
and




u

{\displaystyle u_{e}}
.
For a flat plate at zero angle of attack with a laminar boundary layer, the Blasius solution gives.

The influence of fluid viscosity creates a wall shear stress,




τ

w




{\displaystyle \tau _{w}}
, which extracts energy from the mean flow. The boundary layer can be considered to possess a total momentum flux deficit, due to the frictional dissipation given by:
