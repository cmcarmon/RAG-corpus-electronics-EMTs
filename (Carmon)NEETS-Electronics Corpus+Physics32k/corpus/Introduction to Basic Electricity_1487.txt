Heat can be converted directly to electricity with 
a device called a thermocouple (Figure 12-8). The 
schematic symbol for a thermocouple is shown in 
 Figure 12-9. A thermocouple consists of two dissimilar 
metal wires twisted together. One wire is copper and 
the other wire is zinc or iron. When heat is applied to 
the twisted connection, the copper wire readily gives 
up free electrons, which are transferred to the other 
wire. Thus the copper wire develops a positive charge 
and the other wire develops a negative charge, and a
