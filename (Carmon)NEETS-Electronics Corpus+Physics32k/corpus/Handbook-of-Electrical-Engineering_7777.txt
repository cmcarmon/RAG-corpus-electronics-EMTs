Recording Modes
Several recording modes are used with the express objective of storing data at the highest density and with the
greatest reliability of noncorruption of retrieved data. Two popular but contrasting modes are the non-return-
to-zero  (NRZ)  and phase  encoding  (PE)  modes.  These  are  incompatible  although  some  magnetic  tape  drives
have detectors to sense the mode and operate in a bimodal way. The NRZ technique is shown in Fig. 80.19,
where only the 1 bit is displayed by a reversal of magnetization on the tape. The magnetic polarity remains
unchanged  for  logic  0.  An  external  clock  track  is  also  required  for  this  mode  because  a  pulse  is  not  always
generated for each row of data on the tape.
