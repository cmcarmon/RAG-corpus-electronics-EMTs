From 1.51 to 1.54 equations, you can see that the solution
using the Laplace transform determines the natural response
and forced response at the same time. In addition, the initial
conditions are taken into account when the s-domain circuit is
set up. A limitation of the Laplace transform is that it can be
used only for linear circuits.
