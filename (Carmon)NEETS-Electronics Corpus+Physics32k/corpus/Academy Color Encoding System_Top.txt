The Academy Color Encoding System (ACES) is a color image encoding system created by hundreds of industry professionals under the auspices of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. ACES allows for a fully encompassing color accurate workflow, with "seamless interchange of high quality motion picture images regardless of source".
The system defines its own color primaries that completely encompass the visible spectral locus as defined by the CIE xyY specification. The white point is approximate to the CIE D60 standard illuminant, and ACES compliant files are encoded in 16-bit half-floats, thus allowing ACES OpenEXR files to encode 30 stops of scene information. ACES supports both high dynamic range (HDR) and wide color gamut (WCG).
The version 1.0 release occurred in December 2014, and has been implemented by multiple vendors, and used on multiple motion pictures and television shows. ACES received a Television Academy Emmy Engineering Award in 2012. The system is standardized in part by the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE) standards body. Changes in the ACES specifications, announcements, news, discussion and other information is regularly updated at http://www.ACESCentral.com.
Hundreds of productions, from Motion Pictures to Television to Commercials, and VR content has been produced using ACES including: The Lego Batman Movie (2017) Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017) King Arthur: Legend of the Sword (2017) The Grand Tour (2016 TV Series) Cafe Society (2016) Bad Santa 2 (2016) The Legend of Tarzan (2016) Chef's Table (2016 TV Series) Chappie (2015) The Wedding Ringer (2015) Baahubali: The Beginning (2015) The Wave (2015) For a more complete list, visit the IMDb link here: http://acescentral.com/t/list-of-aces-productions/23
