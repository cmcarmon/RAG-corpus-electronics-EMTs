Figure 5.10 illustrates a somewhat different kind of limiting action. Instead of the positive or negative peaks
being  clipped,  the  output  follows  the  input  when  the  signal  is  above  or  below  a  certain  level.  The  transfer
characteristics show that linear operation occurs only when certain signal levels are reached and that the output
remains constant below those levels. This form of limiting can also be thought of as a special case of that shown
in  Fig.  5.9.  Imagine,  for  example,  that  the  clipping  level  in  Fig. 5.9(b)  is  raised  to  a  positive  value;  then  the
result is the same as Fig. 5.10(a).
