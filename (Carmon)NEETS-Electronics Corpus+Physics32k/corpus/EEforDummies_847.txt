One type of buzzer, a piezoelectric buzzer, contains a diaphragm attached to 
a piezoelectric crystal. When a voltage is applied to the crystal, the crystal 
expands or contracts (the piezoelectric effect); this effect, in turn, makes the 
diaphragm vibrate, generating sound waves. (Note that piezoelectric buzz-
ers work in pretty much the opposite way a crystal microphone works, as 
described earlier in this chapter.)
