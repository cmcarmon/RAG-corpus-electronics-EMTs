The radial acceleration a of an object in orbit at a point along the line passing through both bodies is given by:

{\displaystyle a=-{\frac {GM_{1}}{r^{2}}}\operatorname {sgn}(r)+{\frac {GM_{2}}{(R-r)^{2}}}\operatorname {sgn}(R-r)+{\frac {G((M_{1}+M_{2})r-M_{2}R)}{R^{3}}}}

Where r is the distance from the large body M1 and sgn(x) is the sign function of x. The terms in this function represent respectively: force from M1; force from M2; and centrifugal force. The points L3, L1, L2 occur where the acceleration is zero — see chart at right.
