Another  type  of  active  component  that  has  recently  become  available  commercially  is  the  polarization
controller. This component allows the incoming optical polarization to be continuously adjustable. The device
functions as an electrically variable optical waveplate, where both the birefringence and axes orientation can
be controlled. The controller is realized by using a three-electrode conÔ¨Åguration as shown in Fig. 31.24 on a
substrate orientation where the TE and TM optical polarizations have almost equal velocities. Typical perfor-
mance values are TE/TM conversion of greater than 99% with less than 50 V.
