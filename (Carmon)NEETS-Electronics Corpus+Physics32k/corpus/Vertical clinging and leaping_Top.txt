Vertical clinging and leaping is a type of arboreal locomotion seen most commonly among the strepsirrhine primates, and particularly the members of the family Indriidae. It is also used by haplorrhine tarsiers. At rest, the animal clings to a vertical support, such as the side of a tree or bamboo stalk. To move from one plant to another, it pushes off from one vertical support with its hindlimbs, landing on another vertical support.
