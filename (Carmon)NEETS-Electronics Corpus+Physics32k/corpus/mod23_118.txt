Tape cartridges hold a spool of magnetic tape in the same way as tape reels, except that the inside of
the cartridge contains both the supply reel and the take-up reel. Unlike tape reels which must be manually
loaded into a recorder, when you insert a tape cartridge into a recorder, itâ€™s automatically loaded and ready
to use. Figure 2-6 shows two typical tape cartridges.
