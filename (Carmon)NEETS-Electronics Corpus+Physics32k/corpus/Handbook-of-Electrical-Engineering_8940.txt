Another digitizer technology is the one that uses the measurement of the time required for sound waves to
travel from a source to movable microphone pickups.This sonic technology has the advantage that no special
digitizing board is required, and either a stylus or a cursor can be used as the digitizer. Two sonic sources are
 coordinates can be determined by calculating the time it takes
contained in an 
for the sound wave to reach the microphones contained in the pickup device. This calculation is made on the

tends to limit the resolution to about 300 lpi, and the accuracy to 
with a single sonic source as the digitizing means and a pair of microphones located outside the digitizing area.
In this case the location of the transducer is calculated by triangulation and converted into Cartesian coordinates.
Digitizers are used primarily for inputting accurate coordinate data from maps and engineering drawings.
Their high accuracy requirements have led to relatively high prices. Alternative means for inputting data are
the  data  and  graphics  tablets  that  meet  most  input  requirements  at  a  lower  cost  and  accuracy.  The  main
technology  is  still  electromagnetic,  and  the  units  are  essentially  the  same  as  the  digitizers,  but  with  lower
accuracies. However, several of the other technologies have also been used to achieve lower costs. Most successful
among them are the capacitive and resistive versions, which may also be used as digitizers. The capacitive units,
also termed electrostatic, use capacitive coupling where the coupling between the tablet and the cursor or stylus
is determined by the capacitance made up of the tablet surface as one plate and the pickup element as the other.
In this case, the capacitance is given by
