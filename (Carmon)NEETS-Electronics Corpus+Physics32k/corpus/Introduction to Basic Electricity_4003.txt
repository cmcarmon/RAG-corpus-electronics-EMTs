For the tank circuit to maintain its oscillation, the 
energy that is dissipated must be replaced. The energy 
that is replaced is referred to as positive	feedback. 
Positive feedback is the feeding back of a portion of the 
output signal into the tank circuit to sustain oscilla-
tion. The feedback must be in phase with the signal in 
the tank circuit. Figure 39-1 shows a block diagram of 
an oscillator. The basic oscillator can be broken down 
into three sections. The frequency-determining oscil-
lator circuit is usually an LC tank circuit. An amplifier
