How do you get this on/off thing to work? Say you use an electronic gadget to 
scatter chicken feed automatically at dawn. You can use a photodiode, which 
conducts current when exposed to light, to control the input to a transistor 
switch that delivers current to your gadget (the load). At night, the photodi-
ode doesn’t generate any current, so the transistor is off. When the sun rises, 
the photodiode generates current, turning the transistor on and allowing cur-
rent to flow to your gadget. The gadget then starts scattering chicken feed — 
keeping the chickens happy while you continue to snooze.
