A  more  complicated  reference  voltage  is  required  since  the  reference  is  now 
required  to  sink  or  source  current  through  R1  while  maintaining  a  constant  voltage.  In 
other words, the reference must act like a voltage source with a small output resistance. 
This voltage reference can be generated using a voltage divider circuit buffered by an op 
amp voltage follower.
