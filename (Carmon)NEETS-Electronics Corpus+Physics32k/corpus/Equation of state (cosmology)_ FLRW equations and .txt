The equation of state may be used in Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker equations to describe the evolution of an isotropic universe filled with a perfect fluid. If



a


{\displaystyle a}
is the scale factor then




ρ
∝

a

−

(
1
+
w
)


.


{\displaystyle \rho \propto a^{-3(1+w)}.}

If the fluid is the dominant form of matter in a flat universe, then




a
∝

t

3
(

w
)




,


{\displaystyle a\propto t^{\frac {2}{3(1+w)}},}

where



t


{\displaystyle t}
is the proper time.
In general the Friedmann acceleration equation is
