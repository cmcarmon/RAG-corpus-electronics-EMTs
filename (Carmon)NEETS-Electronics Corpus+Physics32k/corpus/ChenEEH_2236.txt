Exact solutions only exist for a few coordinate systems;
however, these solutions are important both as useful approxi-
mations to real problems and as canonical problems to use
as standards for testing numerical methods of solution. Works
by Boyce and DiPrima (1969) and Sommerfeld (1949) are
good introductions to the subject, whereas the work by Abra-
mowitz and Stegun (1972) is one of the standard reference
handbooks for the functions commonly appearing in bound-
ary value problems. The most common of these problems are
those in which the boundaries across which the material prop-
erties change either ﬁt Cartesian, cylindrical, or spherical co-
ordinates. Since Laplace’s equation is a second-order partial
differential equation, two boundary conditions are needed
at each boundary to solve the problem in addition to condi-
tions at inﬁnity if the problem space includes the point at
inﬁnity.
