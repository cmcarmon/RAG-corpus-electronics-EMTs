You should now have a basic understanding of diodes, many of their characteristics, and some of
their limitations. One of the more important concepts that you should now understand is that most of
these characteristics influence each other. For example, practically all plate characteristics are
interrelated. Change one and the others change. Another example is heater voltage. Every tube parameter
affected by the cathode depends on proper heater voltage. Interrelationships such as these make
electronics both fascinating and, at times, frustrating.
