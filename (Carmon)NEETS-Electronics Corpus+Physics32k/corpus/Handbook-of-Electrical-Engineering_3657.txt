Extrinsic  magnetic  properties  depend  on  type,  composition,  and  structure,  but  they  also  depend  on  the
previous  history  of  the  sample,  e.g.,  heat  treatment.  Examples  of  extrinsic  magnetic  properties  include  the
technologically important properties of remanent magnetization, coercivity, and permeability. These properties
can be substantially altered by heat treatment, quenching, cold-working the sample, or otherwise changing the
size of the magnetic particle.
