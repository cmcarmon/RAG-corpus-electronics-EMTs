A class inheritance relation is realized in HPrTNs through
the reuse of the net structures of inherited super nodes and the
net inscription of inherited elementary nodes (the sorts of
predicates, the label expressions of relevant arcs, and the con-

a class. The inherited predicates and transitions, however, are
explicitly represented or embedded in the subclass to clearly

An inherited element in a subclass has a name of the form
