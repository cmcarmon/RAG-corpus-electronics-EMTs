MACHINE KEYING.â€”The speed with which information can be transmitted using a hand key 
depends on the keying ability of the operator. Early communicators turned to mechanized methods of 
keying the transmitters to speed transmissions. More information could be passed in a given time by 
replacing the hand-operated key with a keying device capable of reading information from punched tape. 
Using this method, several operators could prepare tapes at their normal operating speed. The tapes could 
then be read through the keying device at a higher rate of speed and more information could be 
transmitted in a given amount of time.
