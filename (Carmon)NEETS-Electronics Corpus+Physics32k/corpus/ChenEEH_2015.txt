The ﬂoating point checksum technique for matrix multipli-
cation from Huang and Abraham (1984) is as follows. Con-
sider an n  m matrix A with elements ai, j, 1  i  n,
1  j  m. The column checksum matrix Ac of the matrix
A is an (n þ 1)  m matrix, whose ﬁrst n rows are identical to
those of A and whose last row rowsum (A) consists of elements
anþ1, j:¼
i¼1 ai, j for 1  j  m. Matrix Ac can also be
deﬁned as Ac:¼ [ A
eT A ], where eT is the 1  n row vector
(1, 1, . . . , 1). Similarly, the row checksum matrix Ar of the
matrix A is an n  (m þ 1) matrix, whose ﬁrst m columns are
identical to those of A and whose last column colsum (A)
consists of elements ai, nþ1:¼
j¼1 ai, j for 1  i  n. Matrix
Ar can also be deﬁned as Ar :¼ [AjAe], where Ae is the column
summation vector. Finally, a full checksum matrix Af of A is
deﬁned to be the (n þ 1)  (m þ 1) matrix, which is the
column checksum matrix of the row checksum matrix Ar .
Corresponding to the matrix multiplication C:¼ A  B, the
relation Cf :¼ Ac  Br was established by Huang and Abraham
(1984). This result leads to their ABFT scheme for error de-
tection in matrix multiplication, which can be described as
follows.
