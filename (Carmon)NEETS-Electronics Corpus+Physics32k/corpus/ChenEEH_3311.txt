For the power ﬂow problems, the Gauss-Seidel algorithm
has been known to converge even from poor initial conditions,
which is one of its main strengths. The algorithm is typically
used for ‘‘ﬂat starts’’ when all the initial voltage magnitudes are
set to be at their rated values (V 0
and the bus voltage angles are set to be zero (d0
