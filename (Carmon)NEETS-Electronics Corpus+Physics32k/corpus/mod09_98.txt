Since the capacitor is now completely discharged, the magnetic field surrounding the coil starts to 
collapse. This induces a voltage in the coil which causes the current to continue flowing in the same 
direction and charges the capacitor again. This time the capacitor charges to the opposite polarity, view 
(D).
