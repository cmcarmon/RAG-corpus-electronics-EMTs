Just after 270 degrees the impressed voltage once again starts to decrease, and the capacitor must 
lose electrons from the negative plate. It must discharge, starting at a minimum rate of flow and rising to a 
maximum. This discharging action continues through the last quarter-cycle (270ยบ  to 360ยบ) until the 
impressed-voltage has reached zero. At 360 degrees you are back at the beginning of the entire cycle, and 
everything starts over again.
