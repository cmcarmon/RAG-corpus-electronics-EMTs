The B&R incremental rerouting algorithm Conv_T-DAG
that performs a depth-ﬁrst based T-DAG search in the OG is
given in Figure 8.9 (Dutt et al., 1999). It recursively searches
for converging T-DAGs rooted at each net bumped by the
O-net. A depth-ﬁrst path terminates in success if a spare node
is reached and in failure either when all OG nodes have been
visited in that path or a cycle is detected (an ancestor along the
current path is revisited). When an n
transition fails in
this manner, the search backtracks and tries an unexplored
Tj!Tl
transition n
. The algorithm was shown to be optimal—if
i
a converging T-DAG exists among the currently used tracks for
a CS, Conv_T-DAG will ﬁnd it (Dutt et al., 1999). The entire
reconﬁguration process that invokes Conv_T-DAG for each
CS is impervious to the order of insertion of most CSs but not
of a certain class of CSs (called ‘‘vertical’’ CSs). Thus, the
reconﬁguration process is near optimal.
