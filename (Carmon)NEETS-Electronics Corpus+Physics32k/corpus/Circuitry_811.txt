(cid:127) Operating voltage range: 2.0 V to 6.0 V 
(cid:127) Power consumption: < 2 mA at 5 V, 4 MHz 
(cid:127) 60 µA typical at 2 V, 32 kHz 
(cid:127) < 1 µA typical standby at 2 V (PIC16F84) 
Figure  18.2  shows  the  pin  connections  for  the 
PIC16F84  whilst  Fig.  18.4  shows  how  the  device 
can be used in a simple control application that uses 
four  switched  inputs  (S1  to  S4)  and  three  relay 
outputs (RL1 to RL3).
