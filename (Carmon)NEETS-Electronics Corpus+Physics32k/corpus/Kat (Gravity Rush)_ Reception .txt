Ludwig Kietzmann of GamesRadar+ stated that he liked the character of Kat, calling her an "exuberant girl in a scarf" that stood in contrast to most superheroes, who were a "tortured dude in a cape". He also praised how she was a "delightful klutz", which tied into the game's initially imprecise controls. Stating "there's an art to being utterly graceless in Gravity Rush", he stated that he imagined her apologizing to the people caught up in her gravity powers as she passed by and said that "Kat's optimism in the face of her innate clumsiness is what makes her special".
Steven Strom of Paste Magazine stated that while Kat's amnesia was cliched, it freed her from the typical superhero origin story and established that she helped people due to her natural empathy rather than a past tragedy that befell her. He called what Kat does with her powers "endearing", since she uses them for "smaller, kinder acts of heroism", "literally gain[ing] a wider perspective on the world".
Twinfinite called Kat the runner up for best video game character of 2017, saying "I'm pretty sure it's physically impossible to dislike Kat", and calling her "one of the most charming and believably optimistic characters you'll ever come across in video games. Zhiquing Wan of the same website called Gravity Rush 2 "one of the most compelling stories of a protagonist just looking for something - anything at all - that vaguely resembles a home".
Richard Eisenbeis of Kotaku called Kat not "exactly the ideal heroine", citing her penchant for collateral damage and calling her an "accidental mass-murderer".
