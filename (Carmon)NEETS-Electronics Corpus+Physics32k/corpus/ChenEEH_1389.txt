Run-time management techniques are required to incorpor-
ate the necessary components efﬁciently based on a sequence
for reconﬁguration. If run-time conditions determine how
reconﬁguration should be performed, it may not be feasible
to produce all the reconﬁguration possibilities at compile time.
A solution to this problem is to let the hardware manager build
the new conﬁguration as required at run time (Shirazi et al.,
1998b); various approaches are discussed in Section 3.3.4.
