Coupling is mainly a function of the space between the primary and secondary windings. A
transformer can be loosely coupled (having little transfer of energy), optimumly coupled (just the right
amount of energy transferred), or overcoupled (to the point that the flux lines of primary and secondary
windings interfere with each other).
