Another type of blown fuse indicator uses a small transformer having two identical primaries and a 
secondary connected, as shown in figure 1-46. With both fuses closed, equal currents flow through the 
primaries. This induces mutually canceling voltages in the secondary. If a fuse blows, the induced voltage 
from just one primary is present in the secondary, and the lamp lights.
