The anode block shown in figure 2-27, view (A), has cylindrical cavities and is called a HOLE-
AND-SLOT ANODE. The anode block in view (B) is called the VANE ANODE which has trapezoidal 
cavities. The first two anode blocks operate in such a way that alternate segments must be connected, or 
strapped, so that each segment is opposite in polarity to the segment on either side, as shown in figure 2-
28. This also requires an even number of cavities.
