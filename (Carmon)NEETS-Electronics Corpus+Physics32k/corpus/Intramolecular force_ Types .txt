The classical model identifies three main types of chemical bonds - ionic, covalent, and metallic - distinguished by the degree of charge separation between participating atoms. The characteristics of the bond formed can be predicted by from the properties of constituent atoms, namely electronegativity. They differ in the magnitude of their bond enthalpies, a measure of bond strength, and thus affect the physical and chemical properties of compounds in different ways.
