The Compton wavelength is a quantum mechanical property of a particle. It was introduced by Arthur Compton in his explanation of the scattering of photons by electrons (a process known as Compton scattering). The Compton wavelength of a particle is equal to the wavelength of a photon whose energy is the same as the mass (see mass-energy equivalence) of that particle.
The standard Compton wavelength, λ, of a particle is given by




λ
=


h

m
c



,



{\displaystyle \lambda ={\frac {h}{mc}},\ }

where h is the Planck constant, m is the particle's mass, and c is the speed of light. The significance of this formula is shown in the derivation of the Compton shift formula.
The CODATA 2014 value for the Compton wavelength of the electron is 2.4263102367(11)×10−12 m. Other particles have different Compton wavelengths.
