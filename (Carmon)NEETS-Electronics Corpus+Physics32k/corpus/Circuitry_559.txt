A potential  divider  comprising  R1, R2 and  R3
connected  in  series.  Since  all  three  resistors 
have  the  same  values  the  input  voltage  (VCC)
will be divided into thirds, i.e. one third of VCC 
will appear at the junction of R2 and R3 whilst 
two thirds of VCC will appear at the junction of 
R1 and R2.
Two  operational  amplifiers  connected  as 
comparators.  The  operational  amplifiers  are 
used to examine the voltages at the threshold 
and trigger inputs and compare these with the 
fixed  voltages  from  the  potential  divider  (two 
thirds and one third of VCC respectively). 
An Râ€“S bistable stage. This stage can be either 
set  or  reset  depending  upon  the  output  from 
the comparator stage. An external reset input is 
also provided. 
An open-collector transistor switch. This stage 
is used to discharge an external capacitor by 
effectively shorting it out whenever the base of 
the transistor is driven positive. 
An  inverting  power  amplifier.  This  stage  is 
capable  of  sourcing  and  sinking  enough 
current  (well  over  100  mA  in  the  case  of  a 
standard 555 device) to drive a small relay or 
another  low-resistance  load  connected  to  the 
output.
