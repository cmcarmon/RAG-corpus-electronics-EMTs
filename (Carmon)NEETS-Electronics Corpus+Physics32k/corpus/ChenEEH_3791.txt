In Chomsky’s formalism, a stochastic grammar is one
whose production rules have probabilities associated with
them, so each of the strings in the stochastic language oc-
curs with a probability that depends on the probabilities of
its productions. Clearly, when probabilities are added to the
production rules of the regular grammar, the regular grammar
can be used as an alternative description of the operation of
the Mealy-form HMM. In each ‘‘production’’ (observation
time), the HMM produces a symbol and a new state with a
certain probability. It is very important to generalize our
thinking about the HMM, however, in the present context.
Our fundamental descriptions of the HMM involved acoustic
modeling in which states nominally represented physiologic
acoustic states of the vocal systems and in which symbols
represented acoustic
the
‘‘HMM’’ can represent higher level structures as well. For
example, the states may represent words while the observations
are phonemes, so the model embodies syntactical and lexical
information. As noted earlier, the HMM is usually known as a
ﬁnite-state automaton (FSA) in the formal language theory.
‘‘HMM’’ is almost invariantly used to refer to the model at
the acoustic level, while ‘‘FSA’’ is more likely to be used for the
linguistic models. Regardless of what we call the model,
the critical point is the one-to-one correspondence between
the model and a regular stochastic grammar.
