Q meters are impedance-measuring instruments that determine the ratio of reactance to resistance of 
capacitors or inductors and resistors. Details of Q meters and impedance bridges as well as a number of 
other methods of measuring circuit impedance are described in the following paragraphs. Also discussed 
are methods of measuring the impedance of antennas and transmission lines.
