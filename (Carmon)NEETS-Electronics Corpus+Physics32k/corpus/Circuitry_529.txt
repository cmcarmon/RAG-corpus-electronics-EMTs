Flag register (or status register) 
 
The  result  of  an  ALU  operation  is  sometimes 
important  in  determining  what  subsequent  action 
takes place. The flag register contains a number of 
individual bits that are set or reset according to the 
outcome  of  an  ALU  operation.  These  bits  are 
referred  to  as  flags.  The  following  flags  are 
available in most microprocessors: 
ZERO  
 
 
CARRY
