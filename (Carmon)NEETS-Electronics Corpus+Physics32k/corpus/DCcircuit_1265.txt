If we assume that the potentiometer wiper is being moved such that the rate of voltage
increase across the capacitor is steady (for example, voltage increasing at a constant rate of 2
volts per second), the dv/dt term of the formula will be a ﬁxed value. According to the equa-
tion, this ﬁxed value of dv/dt, multiplied by the capacitor’s capacitance in Farads (also ﬁxed),
results in a ﬁxed current of some magnitude. From a physical perspective, an increasing volt-
age across the capacitor demands that there be an increasing charge differential between the
plates. Thus, for a slow, steady voltage increase rate, there must be a slow, steady rate of
charge building in the capacitor, which equates to a slow, steady ﬂow rate of electrons, or cur-
rent. In this scenario, the capacitor is acting as a load, with electrons entering the negative
plate and exiting the positive, accumulating energy in the electric ﬁeld.
