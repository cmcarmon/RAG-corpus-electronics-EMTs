To illustrate the aforementioned properties, observe the two
different spanning trees of the example in circuit C1 outlined
with the thicker edges in Figure 4.8 (the permissible ranges and
direction labelings have been omitted from Figure 4.8 for
simplicity). The Ô¨Årst tree is shown in Figure 4.8(A) and con-
sists of the edges {e3, e4, e5} and the independent cycles C2
(equation 4.26) and C3 (equation 4.27). As previously ex-
plained, both C2 and C3 contain precisely one of the skews
