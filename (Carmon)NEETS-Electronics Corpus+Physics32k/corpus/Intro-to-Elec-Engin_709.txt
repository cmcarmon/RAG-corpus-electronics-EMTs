*7.4.3 Consider the circuit of Figure P7.4.2 with the
same JFET parameters. Let RS be not speciÔ¨Åed.
Determine vGS, vDS, and RS for active operation at
iD = 2 mA.
7.4.4 A JFET with IDSS = 32 mA and VP = 5 V is
biased to produce iD = 27 mA at vDS = 4 V. Find
the region in which the device is operating.
