An  important  property  of  the  Fourier  series  is  that  the  exponential  basis  functions  e jnwo t  (or  sin(nwot)  and
cos(nwot)  for  the  trigonometric  form)  for  n  =  0, –1, –2,  …  (or  n  =  0,  1,  2,  …  for  the  trigonometric  form)
constitute an orthonormal set; i.e., tnk = 1 for n = k, and tnk = 0 for n „ k, where
