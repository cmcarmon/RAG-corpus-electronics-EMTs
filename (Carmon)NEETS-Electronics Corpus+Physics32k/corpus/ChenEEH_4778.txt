This chapter is online learning conÔ¨Åguration introduced in
the previous subsections involves two major components in the
learning system: the action network and the critic network.
The following devises learning algorithms and elaborates how
learning takes place in each of the two modules. In the discus-
sion is NDP design, both the action network and the critic
network are nonlinear multilayer feed-forward networks. In
these designs, one hidden layer is used in each network. The
neural network structure for the nonlinear, multilayer critic
network is shown in Figure 13.2. In the critic network, the
output J (t ) will be of the form:
