You have now seen how a change in the magnetizing force causes a change in permeability. The
next question is, how do you change the magnetizing force? Magnetizing force is a function of
AMPERE-TURNS. (An ampere-turn is the magnetomotive force developed by 1 ampere of current
flowing in a coil of one turn.) If you increase the ampere-turns of a coil, the magnetizing force increases.
Since it is not practical to increase the number of turns, the easiest way to accomplish this is to increase
the current through the coil.
