Grease Coatings
Another technique employed by utilities for servicing existing
porcelain insulators is the application of high-voltage insula-
tor coatings. Grease coatings have been used for many years.
Greases used fall
into two main categories: hydrocarbon
greases (or petroleum jellies) and silicone greases. Petroleum
jellies are cheaper than silicone greases, which explain their
popularity. But they are not as stable as silicone greases at both
extremes of operating temperature.
In addition, silicone
greases offer superior resistance to tracking than petroleum
jellies. IEEE Standard 957 also addresses grease coatings for
insulators. This practice is used mainly for station insulation.
Most greasing applications are done off-line, although online
application is possible.
