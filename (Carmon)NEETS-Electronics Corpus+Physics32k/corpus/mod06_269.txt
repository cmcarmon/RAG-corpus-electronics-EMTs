Because the screen grid is positively charged, electrons traveling from the cathode to the plate are
accelerated. Electrons are accelerated to such an extent that they dislodge electrons from the plate when
they strike it. This is similar to the manner in which a high-velocity rifle bullet fired into a pile of sawdust
throws sawdust about. Some of these electrons are fired back into the tube, where they tend to accumulate
between the screen grid and the plate. This effect is most pronounced when the signal at the control grid is
going positive and conduction through the tube is increasing. The plate in this situation is going negative
in answer to the control-grid signal. This causes the electrons accumulating between the plate and screen
grid to be attracted to the screen grid. The current that is drawn by the screen grid is lost to the plate and
gain is decreased. Gain is also decreased in another way. The negative charge accumulated by secondary
emission causes some of the electrons (from the cathode) to be repelled from the plate, which further
reduces gain.
