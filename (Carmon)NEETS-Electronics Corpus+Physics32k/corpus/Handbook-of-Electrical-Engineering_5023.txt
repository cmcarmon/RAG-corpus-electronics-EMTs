Halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbons are derived by replacing the hydrogens by either chlorine or ﬂuorine or
both; they may also contain nitrogen and oxygen in their molecular structure. Their dielectric constants range
from 1.8 to 3.0, the higher value reﬂecting some polarity due to molecular asymmetry as a result of branching.
They have superior thermal properties to mineral oils and are highly ﬂame-resistant. Fluorocarbons have been
used in large power transformers, where both ﬂammability and heat removal are of prime concern.
