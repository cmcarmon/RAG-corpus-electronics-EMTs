a term proportional to I and a term proportional to V. This suggests that we
could analyze the circuit first with V = 0 and second with I = 0, and then
combine the two analyses to obtain Equations 2.147 through 2.152. This is in
fact possible, and it leads to yet further analysis simplifications as we shall see
in Chapter 3.
