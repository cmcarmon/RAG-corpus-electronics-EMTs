A 1500-hp, 6600-V, six-pole, 60-Hz, three-phase, wye-connected, synchronous motor, with a
synchronous reactance of 36 , negligible armature resistance, and unity power factor at rated
power, is controlled from a variable-frequency source with constant V/f ratio. Determine the
armature current, torque angle, and power factor at full-load torque, one-half rated speed, and
rated Ô¨Åeld current. (Neglect friction, windage, and core loss.)
