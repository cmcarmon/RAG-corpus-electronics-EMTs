One  of  the  most  fundamental  parameters  to  measure  in  a  digital  communication  system  is  the  steady-state
BER.  The  simplest  method  for  estimating  the  BER  is  to  perform  a  Monte  Carlo  (MC)  simulation.  The
simulation conducts the same test one would perform on the physical system. All data sources and noise sources
produce typical waveforms. The output of the demodulator is compared to the output of the message source,
and the BER is estimated by dividing the number of observed errors by the number of bits transmitted. This
is  a  simple  technique  that  will  work  with  any  system  that  has  ergodic  [Papoulis,  1965]  noise  processes.  The
downside of this approach is that one must often pass a very large number of samples through the system to
produce a reliable estimate of the BER. The question of how many samples must be collected can be answered
using conﬁdence intervals. The conﬁdence interval gives a measure of how close the true BER will be to the
estimate produced by the MC simulation. A typical conﬁdence interval curve is shown in Fig. 78.9. The ratio
of the size of the conﬁdence interval to the size of the estimate is a function of the number of errors observed.
Convenient rules of thumb for this work are that after one error is observed the point estimate is accurate to
within 3 orders of magnitude, after 10 errors the estimate is accurate to within a factor of 2, and after 100 errors
the point estimate will be accurate to a factor of 1.3. This requirement for tens or hundreds of errors to occur
frequently  limits  the  usefulness  of  MC  simulations  for  systems  that  have  low  error  rates  and  has  motivated
research into more efﬁcient methods of estimating BER.
