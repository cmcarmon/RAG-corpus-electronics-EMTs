The differential voltmeter is a solid-state instrument that provides the capability of making dc
voltage measurements from +/ -  10 microvolts to +/ -  1,100 volts. Ac voltages from 0.001 to 1,100 volts
can be measured over a frequency range from 5 hertz to 100 kilohertz. Both of these measurements can be
made without concern for loading the circuit. The differential voltmeter has four voltage readout dials that
vary the resistance of the divider assembly as described above.
