the capacitor offers very low impedance compared to that of the resistor at
high frequencies, and the entire input voltage falls across the resistor.
if the frequency of the input is decreased from
1000 rad/s to, say, 1 rad/s, Vr ≈ 0 V. This says that the capacitor has a very
high impedance compared to that of the resistor at low frequencies. Therefore,
nearly all of the input voltage falls across the capacitor, resulting in Vr ≈ 0.
