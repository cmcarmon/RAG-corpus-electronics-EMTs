circuit is capable of swapping information with the programmer and is activated by a magnetic reed switch.
The  above  circuits  are  currently  built  using  CMOS  integrated  circuits, VLSI  design,  and  hybrid  technology.
Continuing advances in the electronics industry will allow for further size reductions.
