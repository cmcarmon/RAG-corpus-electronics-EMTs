For the description of the electrical percolation, we identify the occupied bonds of the bond-percolation model with the metallic component having a conductivity




σ

m




{\displaystyle \sigma _{m}}
. And the dielectric component with conductivity




σ

d




{\displaystyle \sigma _{d}}
corresponds to non-occupied bonds. We consider the two following well-known cases of a conductor-insulator mixture and a superconductor–conductor mixture.
