If the voltages applied to phases 1-1A and 2-2A are 90ยบ out of phase, the currents that flow in the
phases are displaced from each other by 90ยบ . Since the magnetic fields generated in the coils are in phase
with their respective currents, the magnetic fields are also 90ยบ  out of phase with each other. These two
out-of-phase magnetic fields, whose coil axes are at right angles to each other, add together at every
instant during their cycle. They produce a resultant field that rotates one revolution for each cycle of ac.
