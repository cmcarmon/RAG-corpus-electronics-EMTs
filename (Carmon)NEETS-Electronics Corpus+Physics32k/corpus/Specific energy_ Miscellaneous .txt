Kinetic energy per unit mass: 1/2v2, where v is the speed (giving J/kg when v is in m/s). See also kinetic energy per unit mass of projectiles.
Potential energy with respect to gravity, close to earth, per unit mass: gh, where g is the acceleration due to gravity (standardized as ~9.8 m/s2) and h is the height above the reference level (giving J/kg when g is in m/s2 and h is in m).
Heat: energies per unit mass are specific heat capacity times temperature difference, and specific melting heat, and specific heat of vaporization
