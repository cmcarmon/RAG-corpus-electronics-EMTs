The  stator  of  the  simple  machine  is  a  permanent  magnet  with  two  poles  labeled  N  and  S.  The  rotor  is  a
cylindrical  body  and  has  two  (insulated)  conductors  embedded  in  its  surface.  At  one  end  of  the  rotor,  as
illustrated  in  Fig.  66.7,  the  two  conductors  are  connected  to  a  pair  of  copper  segments;  these  semicircular
segments, shown in the diagram, are mounted on the shaft of the rotor. Hence, they rotate together with the
rotor. At the other end of the rotor, the two conductors are joined to form a coil.
