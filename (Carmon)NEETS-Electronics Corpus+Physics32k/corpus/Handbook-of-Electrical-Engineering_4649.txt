A SAW transducer is able to implement an FIR ﬁlter. The electrodes or ﬁngers provide the ability to sample
or “tap” the SAW and the distance between electrodes provides the relative delay. For a uniformly sampled SAW
 is
transducer, the delay between samples, 
the acoustic velocity. The typical means for providing attenuation or weighting is to vary the overlap between
adjacent electrodes which provides a spatially weighted sampling of a uniform wave. Figure 47.1 shows a typical
FIR time response and its equivalent SAW transducer implementation. A SAW ﬁlter is composed of a minimum
of two transducers and possibly other SAW components. A schematic of a simple SAW bidirectional ﬁlter is
  radiates  energy  equally  from  each  side  of  the  transducer  (or

port). Energy not being received is absorbed to eliminate spurious reﬂections.
