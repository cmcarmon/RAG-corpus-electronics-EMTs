A simple synchro transmission system consisting of a torque transmitter connected to a torque 
receiver (TX-TR) is illustrated in figure 1-16. As you can see, in this system the rotors are connected in 
parallel across the ac line. The stators of both synchros have their leads connected S1 to S1, S2 to S2, and 
S3 to S3, so the voltage in each of the transmitter stator coils opposes the voltage in the corresponding 
coils of the receiver. The voltage directions are indicated by arrows for the instant of time shown by the 
dot on the ac line voltage.
