Let us attempt to solve this differential equation by summing its homogeneous
and particular solutions. Recall, when dealing with circuit responses, the homo-
geneous solution is also called the natural response, and the particular solution
is also called the forced response. Recall further that the forced response depends
on the external inputs to the circuit. Let us denote the homogeneous solution
as vch and the particular or forced solution as vcp. Then, we know that the total
solution is given by
