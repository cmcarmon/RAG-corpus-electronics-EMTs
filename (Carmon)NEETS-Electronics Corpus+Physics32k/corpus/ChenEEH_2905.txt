Tracking refers to a radar following the position of one or
multiple targets in space. Before the tracking process, the radar
has to detect targets and Ô¨Ånd their range, angular location, and
sometimes velocity. The requirements on the accuracy of angle
measurement for a tracking radar are more strict than those
for a search radar.
