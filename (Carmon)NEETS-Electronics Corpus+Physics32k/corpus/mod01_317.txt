First, you will learn about the building block of all batteries, the CELL. The explanation will explore 
the physical makeup of the cell and the methods used to combine cells to provide useful voltage, current, 
and power. The chemistry of the cell and how chemical action is used to convert chemical energy to 
electrical energy are also discussed.
