Long clock and data lines between gates within computer chips can have significant para-
sitic inductance, perhaps as much as tens of pico Henries per millimeter. This inductance
becomes increasingly important as clock rates increase. Similarly, long power supply lines
within computer chips and on printed-circuit boards (see Figure 12.33) can have signifi-
cant parasitic inductance. This inductance becomes increasingly important as circuits are
switched on and off dynamically in an effort to save power and reduce heat dissipation
when the circuits are functionally inactive. Finally, as data lines pass across chip bound-
aries they acquire parasitic inductance arising from the bonding wires within the chips
(see Figure 12.34) and the interconnection between the chips. This inductance can be as
high as tens of nano Henries or more.
