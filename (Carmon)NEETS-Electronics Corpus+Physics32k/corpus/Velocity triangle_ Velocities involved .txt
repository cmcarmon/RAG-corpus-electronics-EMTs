A general velocity triangle consists of the following vectors:
V : Absolute velocity of the fluid.
U : Blade Linear velocity.
Vr: Relative velocity of the fluid after contact with rotor.
Vw: Tangential component of V (absolute velocity), called Whirl velocity.
Vf: Flow velocity (axial component in case of axial machines, radial component in case of radial machines).
The following angles are encountered during the analysis:
α: Angle made by V with the plane of the machine (usually the nozzle angle or the guide blade angle).
β: Angle of the rotor blade. Absolute angle
