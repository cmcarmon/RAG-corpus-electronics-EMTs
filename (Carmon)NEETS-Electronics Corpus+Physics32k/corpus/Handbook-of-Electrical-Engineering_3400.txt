 that limits the speed at which they can perform continuous
conversions. The sampling rate is the number of times per second that the analog signal can be sampled and
converted  into  a  digital  code.  For  proper A/D  conversion,  the  minimum  sampling  rate  must  be  at  least  two
times the highest frequency of the analog signal being sampled to satisfy the Nyquist sampling criterion. The
conversion  speed  and  other  timing  factors  must  be  taken  into  consideration  to  determine  the  maximum
use a sampling rate that is slightly more than twice
sampling rate of an A/D converter.
