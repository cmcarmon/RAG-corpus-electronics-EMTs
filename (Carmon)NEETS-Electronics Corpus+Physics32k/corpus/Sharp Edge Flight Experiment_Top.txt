SHEFEX (Sharp Edge Flight Experiment), is an experiment conducted by the German Aerospace Center (DLR), for the development of some new, cheaper and safer design principles for space capsules, hypersonic vehicles and spaceplanes with re-entry capability in the atmosphere and their integration into a complete system.
DLR explained the objectives of SHEFEX: The aim of the research is a spaceplane that is usable for experiments under microgravity from 2020 on. It is set to finish with a space plane project named REX Freeflyer(REX for Returnable experiment, dt. Rückkehrexperiment).
During re-entry of spacecraft into the earth's atmosphere, the high velocity of the spacecraft together with friction and displacement of air molecules leads to temperatures of over 2000 °C. In order to not burn up, spaceships need very expensive and sometimes failing heat shields.
