This  shows  that  when  a  function  is  integrated  with  the  impulse  func-
tion, we obtain the value of the function at the point where the impulse
occurs. This is a highly useful property of the impulse function known
as  the  sampling or  sifting property.  The  special  case  of  Eq.  (7.31)  is
for
