For motors the major consideration is the torqueâ€“speed characteristics. The requirements
of motor loads generally vary from one application to another. Some may need constant speed
or horsepower, while some others may require adjustable varying speeds with different torque
capabilities. For any motor application, the starting torque, maximum torque, and running
characteristics (along with current requirements) should be looked into.
