By using these equations together, dimensions of the patch
antenna can be chosen to achieve a particular resonant fre-
quency. The accuracy of the model is typically a few percent.
Because the bandwidth of a microstrip-fed patch is on the
same order, this may not be accurate enough for Ô¨Årst pass
design.
