Consider a collection of points {xi} in the plane ℝ2 that form a homogeneous Poisson process Φ with constant (point) density λ. For each point of the Poisson process (i.e. xi ∈ Φ, place a disk Di with its center located at the point xi. If each disk Di has a random radius Ri (from a common distribution) that is independent of all the other radii and all the underlying points {xi}, then the resulting mathematical structure is known as a random disk model.
