To help you understand the magnitude of the distance a wavefront (the initial part of a wave) travels 
during 1 cycle, we will compute the wavelengths (l;) of several frequencies. Consider a vector that rotates 
at 1 revolution per second. The resultant sine wave is transmitted into space by an antenna. As the vector 
moves from its 0-degree starting position, the wavefront begins to travel away from the antenna. When 
the vector reaches the 360-degree position, and the sine wave is completed, the sine wave is stretched out 
over 300,000,000 meters. The reason the sine wave is stretched over such a great distance is that the 
wavefront has been moving away from the antenna at 300,000,000 meters per second. This is shown in 
the following example:
