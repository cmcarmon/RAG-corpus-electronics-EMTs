Most ATPG programs operate by picking a possible fault from among the possible faults, generating a speciÔ¨Åc
test pattern that covers it, simulating the logic circuit with the newly generated test pattern to determine which
other faults are incidentally covered by the same pattern, and continuing the process until all faults have been
considered. Of the two related processes of test pattern generation and fault simulation, the latter is by far the
more time-consuming one.
