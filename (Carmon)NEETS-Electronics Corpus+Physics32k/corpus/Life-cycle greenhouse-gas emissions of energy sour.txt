An MIT peer-reviewed study suggested that using wind turbines to meet 10 percent of global energy demand in 2100 could have a warming effect, causing temperatures to rise by 1 째C (1.8 째F) in the regions on land where the wind farms are installed, including a smaller increase in areas beyond those regions. This is due to the effect of wind turbines on both horizontal and vertical atmospheric circulation. While turbines installed in water would have a cooling effect, the net impact on global surface temperatures would be an increase of 0.15 째C (0.27 째F). Author Ron Prinn said that the study hadn't conclusively proved this and cautioned against interpreting the study "as an argument against wind power." He urged instead that it guide future research.
