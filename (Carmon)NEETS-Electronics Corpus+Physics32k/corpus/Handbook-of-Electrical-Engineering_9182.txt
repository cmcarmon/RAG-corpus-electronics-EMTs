How serious this trend is depends upon industry reactions. Hardware manufacturers design more powerful
chips  dedicated  to  operate  with  higher  clock  speeds,  offering  larger  memory  space,  in  some  cases  injecting
speciﬁc commands into the processor’s command list (Siemens’s picoJava concept encapsulating speciﬁc Java-
Card  commands  in  processor  design),  and  adding  specialized  coprocessors  (cryptographic  functions).  Card
manufacturers  improve  their  OOSs  to  meet  multi-application  requirements  by  adding  new  features  up  to
recently imminent to pure IT (multi-thread, COM, ﬁrewalls, add/load/delete), system integrators adapt their
solutions to absorb speciﬁc card management systems (CMS) allowing control over the live cycle of applications
(and cards), card issuers design multi-applicative programs for their customers, and ﬁnally, software develop-
ment companies begin to create competitive, cutting edge competence in smart card OOS-dedicated applica-
tions development. The recent entry into the industry includes the software giant — Microsoft with its Smart
Card for Windows (SCW). This entry establishes the seriousness of the smart card trend.
