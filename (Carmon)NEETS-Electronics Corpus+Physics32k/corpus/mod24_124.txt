Figure 2-12 illustrates the relationship between the acceptance angle and the refractive indices. The
index of refraction of the fiber core is n1. The index of refraction of the fiber cladding is n2. The index of
refraction of the surrounding medium is n0. By using Snell's law and basic trigonometric relationships, the
NA of the fiber is given by:
