Electroencephalography (EEG)
The electrical activity of the brain can be recorded with electrodes on the scalp, on the exposed brain, or inserted
into  the  brain.  The  latter  method  is  used  in  research  studies. When  recordings  are  made  with  brain-surface
(cortex) electrodes, the recording is called an electrocorticogram (ECoG). With scalp electrodes, the recording
is designated an electroencephalogram (EEG) that is displayed by direct-inking pens using a chart speed of 3
cm/s. Typically 8 to 12 channels are recorded simultaneously.
