Flash freezing refers to the process whereby objects are frozen in a few hours by subjecting them to cryogenic temperatures, or by direct contact with liquid nitrogen at −196 degrees Celsius.
Now, it is shown how cold water can get before it absolutely must freeze: −48 degrees Celsius.
Freezing water is a central issue for climate, geology and life. On earth, ice and snow cover 10 percent of the land and up to half of the northern hemisphere in winter. Polar ice caps reflect up to 90 percent of the sun’s incoming radiation. The science of freezing water depends on multiple factors, including how water droplets freeze, how much water in the atmosphere, if the water is in the liquid or crystal state, at what temperature it freezes, whether it crystallizes from within or from the surface.
The freezing of nanoscale water or silicon liquid drops is initiated at a number of different distances from the centre of the droplet, providing new insights on a long-standing dispute in the field of material and chemical physics.
When water is in a conventional freezer, a dynamic phase transition is triggered. The resulting ice depends on how quickly the system is cooled: If the water is cooled below its freezing point slowly, an ice crystal will result, rather than the poly-crystalline solid that flash freezing results in.
