Sagittal plane motions of the ankle occur at the talocrural joint. As the heel contacts the ground the ankle joint is near neutral in either slight plantar flexion or dorsiflexion. Immediately following heel strike the ankle plantar flexes until the foot is positioned flat on the ground. This plantar flexion movement is controlled eccentrically by the ankle dorsiflexors. As the body glides over the fixed foot, a maximum of about 10 degrees of ankle dorsiflexion is reached. The ankle dorsiflexion is a result of the tibia moving forward over the foot and is facilitated by eccentric control provided by the soleus. Concurrently, the knee reaches full extension and as the heel rises off the ground the ankle begins to plantar flex. The ankle reaches a maximum of 15-20 degrees of plantar flexion right before push-off which is accomplished concentrically by the plantar flexor muscles. Right after toe off the ankle is dorsiflexed to neutral position for toe clearance during swing phase.
