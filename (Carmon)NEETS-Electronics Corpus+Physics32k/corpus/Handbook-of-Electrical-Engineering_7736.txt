While vertical recording techniques have long been touted as the technology of the future, advances in head
technology  make  it  possible  to  continue  using  conventional  horizontal  methods,  but  still  keep  disks  on  the
MAD curve. These magneto-resistive heads employ noninductive methods for reading, which work well with
dense horizontal recording Ô¨Åelds. However, a more conventional head is needed for writing, but this dual-head
organization permits separate optimizations for read and write.
