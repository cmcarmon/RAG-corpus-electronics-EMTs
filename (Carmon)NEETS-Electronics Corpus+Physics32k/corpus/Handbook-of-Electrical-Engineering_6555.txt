Source Coupler
The light emitted from the diode must be coupled as efﬁciently as possible into the ﬁber. Because the beam
pattern emitted by a laser diode does not perfectly match the pattern of light propagating in the ﬁber, there is
an inevitable mismatch loss. Good coupler designs, sometimes using miniature lenses, reduce this loss to about
3 dB when feeding a single-mode ﬁber.
