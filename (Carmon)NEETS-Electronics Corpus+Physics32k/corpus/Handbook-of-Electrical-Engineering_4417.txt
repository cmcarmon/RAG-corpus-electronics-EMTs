is to assure that the ﬁbers in the cables maintain their optical properties (attenuation and dispersion) during
their service life under different environmental conditions. The design, therefore, must minimize microbending
effects. This usually means letting the ﬁber take a minimum energy position at all times in the cable structure.
Proper selection of cabling materials so as to minimize differential thermal expansion or contraction during
temperature extremes is important in minimizing microbending loss. The cable structure must be such that
the  ﬁbers  carry  a  load  well  below  the  proof-test  level  at  all  times,  and  especially  while  using  conventional
installation equipment. The cables must provide adequate protection to the ﬁbers under all adverse environ-
mental conditions during their entire service life, which may be as long as 40 years. Finally, the cable designs
should be cost effective and easily connectorized or spliced.
