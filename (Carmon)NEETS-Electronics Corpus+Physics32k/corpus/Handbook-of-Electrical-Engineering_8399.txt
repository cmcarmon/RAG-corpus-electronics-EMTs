Number systems provide the basis for conveying and quantifying information. Weather data, stocks, pagination
of books, weights and measures—these are just a few examples of the use of numbers that affect our daily lives.
For  this  purpose  we  ﬁnd  the  decimal  (or  arabic)  number  system  to  be  reliable  and  easy  to  use.  This  system
evolved presumably because early humans were equipped with a crude type of calculator, their ten ﬁngers. A
number system that is appropriate for humans, however, may be intractable for use by a machine such as a
computer. Likewise, a number system appropriate for a machine may not be suitable for human use.
