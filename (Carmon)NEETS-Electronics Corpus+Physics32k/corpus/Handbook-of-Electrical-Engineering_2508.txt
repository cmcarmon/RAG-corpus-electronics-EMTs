The term “normal operating conditions” is easily interpreted from Fig. 24.26(a), which shows that when VBE
has reached about 0.6 to 0.7 V, any small ﬂuctuations in its value cause major ﬂuctuations in IC. This situation
is illustrated by the dashed lines enclosing DVBE and D IC, and it implies that to use the transistor as an ampliﬁer,
working values of VBE and IC must be established, after which signals may be regarded as ﬂuctuations around
these values.
