Figure 9.3(B) the sinusoidal wave along the f Â¼ 45 cut passes
through zero at 63.684D cells, whereas the wave along the
f Â¼ 0, 90 cut passes through zero at 63.559D cells. Taking
the difference, we see that the obliquely propagating wave
â€˜â€˜leadsâ€™â€™ the on-axis wave by 0.125D cells. This yields a numer-
ical phase-velocity anisotropy D~vvp=~vvp ï¬ƒ 0:125=63:6 Â¼ 0:197%.
This number is only about 5% less than the 0.208% value
obtained using equations 9.35b and 9.36b.
