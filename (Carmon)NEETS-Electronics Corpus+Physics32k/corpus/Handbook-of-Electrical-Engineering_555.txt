Figure 5.15 shows double-ended limiting circuits, in which both positive and negative peaks of the output
waveform are clipped. Figure 5.15(a) shows the conventional parallel clipping circuit and (b) shows how double-
ended limiting is accomplished in an operational ampliﬁer circuit. In each circuit, note that no more than one
diode is forward biased at any given time and that both diodes are reverse biased for –E1 < vo < E2, the linear
region.
