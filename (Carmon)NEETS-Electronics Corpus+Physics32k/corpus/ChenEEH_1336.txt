independent tasks distributed among a number of processors
and (2) faster execution of a single task on multiple processors.
The organization and design of the system differs signiÔ¨Åcantly
for the two different goals; some system architectures are
discussed in Section 2.2. The programming of the system
also depends highly on the architecture and desired function-
ality, as discussed in Section 2.4.
