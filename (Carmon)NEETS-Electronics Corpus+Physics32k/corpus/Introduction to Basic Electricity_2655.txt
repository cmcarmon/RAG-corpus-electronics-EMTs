from across the capacitor. At low frequencies, the capaci-
tive reactance is higher than the resistance, so most of the 
voltage is dropped across the capacitor. Therefore, most 
of the voltage appears across the output. As the input 
frequency increases, the capacitive reactance decreases, 
and less voltage is dropped across the capacitor. There-
fore, more voltage is dropped across the resistor, with 
a decrease in the output voltage. The cutoff is  gradual. 
Frequencies above the cutoff point pass with a gradual 
attenuation in the output voltage. Figure 24-3 shows a 
frequency response curve for an RC low-pass filter.
