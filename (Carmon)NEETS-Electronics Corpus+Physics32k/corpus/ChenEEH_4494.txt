To compare the results with the well-known LQG controller,
the system was simulated with an LQG controller. The u
approached inﬁnity in equation 5.36. Note that equation 5.36
becomes a classical Riccati equation as u goes to inﬁnity. This
is shown in Figure 5.3. Note that in LQG case, it takes longer
for yaw and roll angles to fall below 0.1 degree, and the
variation in the angles are larger than the RS case. Thus, in
this sense, RS controller outperforms the LQG controller.
