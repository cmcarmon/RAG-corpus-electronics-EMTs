In the present day, the Sun is losing mass from the emission of electromagnetic energy and by the ejection of matter with the solar wind. It is expelling about (2–3)×10−14 M☉ per year. The mass loss rate will increase when the Sun enters the red giant stage, climbing to (7–9)×10−14 M☉ y−1 when it reaches the tip of the red giant branch. This will rise to 10−6 M☉ y−1 on the asymptotic giant branch, before peaking at a rate of 10−5 to 10−4 M☉ y−1 as the Sun generates a planetary nebula. By the time the Sun becomes a degenerate white dwarf, it will have lost 46% of its starting mass.
