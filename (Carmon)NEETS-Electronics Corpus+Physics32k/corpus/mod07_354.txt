The application of a large enough negative voltage to the gate will cause the depletion region to 
become so large that conduction of current through the bar stops altogether. The voltage required to 
reduce drain current (ID) to zero is called "pinch-off" voltage and is comparable to "cut-off" voltage in a 
vacuum tube. In figure 3-48, the negative 1 volt applied, although not large enough to completely stop 
conduction, has caused the drain current to decrease markedly (from 10 milliamperes under zero gate bias 
conditions to 5 milliamperes). Calculation shows that the 1-volt gate bias has also increased the resistance 
of the JFET (from 500 ohms to 1 kilohm). In other words, a 1-volt change in gate voltage has doubled the 
resistance of the device and cut current flow in half.
