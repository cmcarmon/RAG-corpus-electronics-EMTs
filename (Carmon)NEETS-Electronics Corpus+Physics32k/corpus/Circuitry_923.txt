30. Figure  A2.13  shows  the  characteristic  of  a 
diode.  Determine  the  resistance  of  the  diode 
when (a) VF = 2 V and (b) IF = 9 mA. [Page 90] 
31. A transistor operates with a collector current of 
25  mA  and  a  base  current  of  200  ÂµA. 
Determine: (a) the value of emitter current; (b) 
the  value  of  common-emitter  current  gain;  and 
(c) the new value of collector current if the base 
current increases by 50%. [Page 96]
