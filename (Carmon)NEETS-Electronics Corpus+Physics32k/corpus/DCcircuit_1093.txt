In the common ”lead-acid” cell (the kind commonly used in automobiles), the negative elec-
trode is made of lead (Pb) and the positive is made of lead (IV) dioxide (Pb02), both metallic
substances. It is important to note that lead dioxide is metallic and is an electrical conductor,
unlike other metal oxides that are usually insulators. (note: Table 11.1) The electrolyte solu-
tion is a dilute sulfuric acid (H2SO4 + H2O). If the electrodes of the cell are connected to an
external circuit, such that electrons have a place to ﬂow from one to the other, lead(IV) atoms
in the positive electrode (PbO2) will gain two electrons each to produce Pb(II)O. The oxygen
atoms which are “left over” combine with positively charged hydrogen ions (H)+to form water
(H2O). This ﬂow of electrons into into the lead dioxide (PbO2) electrode, gives it a positive elec-
trical charge. Consequently, lead atoms in the negative electrode give up two electrons each to
−2) produced from the disassocia-
produce lead Pb(II), which combines with sulfate ions (SO4
tion of the hydrogen ions (H+) from the sulfuric acid (H2SO4) to form lead sulfate (PbSO4). The
ﬂow of electrons out of the lead electrode gives it a negative electrical charge. These reactions
are shown diagrammitically below:[1]
