The direct search algorithm matches a data driven model to the synthetic dispersion curve (Wathelet et al., 2004). This algorithm creates a theoretical dispersion curve by guessing parameters such as shear wave velocity, compressional wave velocity, density, and thickness. After the theoretical curve is created, the computer then attempts to match this theoretical curve with the actual (experimental) dispersion curve. The values of the parameters are picked at random, with different permutations, and repeated continuously until matching curves are achieved. In some cases, while running the algorithm, different values of shear and compressional velocities, density, and thickness might produce the same dispersion curve. The algorithm calculates a value known as the misfit value as it generates each theoretical dispersion curve. The misfit value is simply a measure of how the generated model stacks up to a true solution. Misfit is given by,

where xdi is the velocity of data curve at frequency fi, xci is the velocity of the calculated curve at frequency fi, σi is the uncertainty of the frequency samples considered and nF is the number of frequency samples considered. If no uncertainty is provided, σi is replaced by xdi.
