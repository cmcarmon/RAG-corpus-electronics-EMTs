At heel contact the hip is maximally flexed at approximately 30 degrees. The hip extensor muscles are active and prepared to extend the hip to prevent any uncontrolled trunk flexion over the femur. Once the foot is flat on the ground, the hip gradually extends in preparation for weight acceptance as the whole-body moves forward over the stance foot. Between 30-50% of the gait cycle, the hip flexor muscles are eccentrically acting as the hip continues to extend, until reaching maximal extension at approximately 10-15 degrees past neutral. This max extension takes place right before toe off. The hip flexors then concentrically act to initiate hip flexion for swing phase. Overall, approximately 30 degrees of flexion and 10 degrees of extension (from neutral) are needed at the hip joint for a normal walking pattern.
