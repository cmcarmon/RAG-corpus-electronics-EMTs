In Zhou et al. (2000), FTHN is extended by adding a time
interval with a possibility value p in the form of p[a, b] to
each transition. That is, each transition is associated with a
ﬁring interval denoted p[a, b], where the default interval is
1[0, 0] (a transition deﬁnitely ﬁres as soon as it is enabled). If a
transition t is enabled at time instant t, it may not ﬁre before
time instant t þ a and must ﬁre before or at time instant
t þ b. Possibility p is a value in the interval [0, 1], where p is
1 if transition t is not in structural conﬂict with any other
transition, and p can be less than 1 when we want to assign
different chances to transitions in conﬂict. Here, structural
conﬂict means that a transition t shares some input place
