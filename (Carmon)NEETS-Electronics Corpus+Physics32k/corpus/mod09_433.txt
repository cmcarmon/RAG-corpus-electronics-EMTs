CRITICAL DAMPING gives the most rapid transient response without overshoot. This is 
accomplished by adjusting R2 to achieve a waveform as shown in figure 3-36, view (A). The resistance of 
R2 depends upon the Q of the transformer. View (A) shows that oscillations, including the overshoot, are 
damping out.
