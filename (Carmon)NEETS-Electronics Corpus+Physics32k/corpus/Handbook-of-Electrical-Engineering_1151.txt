where we have assumed M = N in the original transfer function and where K is the largest integer contained
in (N + 1)/2. If N is odd, the values of a2k and b2k in one term are zero. The realization corresponding to this
transfer function factorization is shown in Fig. 14.18. Each second-order Hk(z) term in this realization is referred
to  as  a  biquad.  The  digital  ﬁlter  design  programs  in  Parks  and  Burrus  [1987]  and Antoniou  [1979]  give  the
ﬁlter transfer function in factored form.
