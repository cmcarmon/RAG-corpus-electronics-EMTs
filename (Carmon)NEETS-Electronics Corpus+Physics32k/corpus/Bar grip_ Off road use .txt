The first deliberate use bar grip tyres as off-road tyres, were developed pre-war as truck tyres particularly for army use. They used crosswise tread bars for grip. arranged in a helical pattern. A helical pattern was used to avoid the uneven rolling radius and vibration of a tread with simple crosswise bars and large gaps between. This helical pattern also gave rise to a sideways force, particularly on tarmac. As all tyres had the same 'hand', this force increased across the two sides of the vehicle. To counteract this force, the central stop-rib was added. The stop-rib was only partly successful though; snowy conditions led the Swiss Post Office to use left- and right-handed tyres to balance the force across the vehicle. Later developments would use balanced arrangements of ribs in a chevron or herringbone layout. The more common arrangement for the later low-speed military bar grip was to use straight bars, but relying on the centre rib to avoid their vibration problems on tarmac.
All bar grips are crossplies, having been developed when this was the only practical means of manufacturing tyres. The simple pattern of bar grips also made them easy to manufacture and hard-wearing, even if made from poor quality or ersatz rubber, bulked up with extreme quantities of non-rubber fillers.
