of time) in addition to a sinusoidal term. Furthermore, the frequency of the sinusoidal term is twice that of
the voltage or current. Plots of v, i, and p are shown in Fig. 3.21 for speciÔ¨Åc values of a and b. The power is
sometimes positive, sometimes negative. This means that power is sometimes delivered to the terminals and
sometimes extracted from them.
