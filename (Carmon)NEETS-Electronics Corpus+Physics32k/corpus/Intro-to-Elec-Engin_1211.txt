The overall output limitations are as shown in Figure 13.4.12. With base speed deﬁned as the
full-ﬁeld speed of the motor at the normal armature voltage, speeds above base speed are obtained
by motor-ﬁeld control at approximately constant horsepower, and speeds below base speed are
obtained by armature-voltage control at approximately constant torque. The development of solid-
state controlled rectiﬁers capable of handling many kilowatts has opened up a whole new ﬁeld of
solid-state dc motor drives with precise control of motor speed. The control resistors (in which
energy is wasted) are eliminated through the development of power semiconductor devices and
