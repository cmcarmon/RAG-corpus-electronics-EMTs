A clear understanding of microwave tubes must start with an understanding of how electrons and 
electric fields interact. An electron has mass and thus exhibits kinetic energy when in motion. The amount 
of kinetic energy in an electron is directly proportional to its velocity; that is, the higher the velocity, the 
higher the energy level. The basic concept of the electron energy level being directly related to electron 
velocity is the key principle of energy transfer and amplification in microwave tubes.
