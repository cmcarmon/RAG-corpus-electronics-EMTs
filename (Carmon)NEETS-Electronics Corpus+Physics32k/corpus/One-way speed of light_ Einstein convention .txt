This method synchronizes distant clocks in such a way that the one-way speed of light becomes equal to the two-way speed of light. If a signal sent from A at time




t

1




{\displaystyle t_{1}}
is arriving at B at time




t

2




{\displaystyle t_{2}}
and coming back to A at time




t

3




{\displaystyle t_{3}}
, then the following convention applies:





t

{\displaystyle t_{2}=t_{1}+{\tfrac {1}{2}}\left(t_{3}-t_{1}\right)}
.
The details of this method, and the conditions that assure its consistency are discussed in Einstein synchronization.
