The simplest configuration considered in Ref. 1 consists of an interface between an isotropic material with permittivity ε and a uniaxial crystal with permittivities εo and εe for the ordinary and the extraordinary waves respectively. The crystal C axis is parallel to the interface. For this configuration, the DSW can propagate along the interface within certain angular intervals with respect to the C axis, provided that the condition of εe > ε > εo is satisfied. Thus DSW are supported by interfaces with positive birefringent crystals only (εe > εo). The angular interval is defined by the parameter η =εe/εo − 1. The angular intervals for the DSW phase and group velocities (Δθph and Δθgr) are different. The phase velocity interval is proportional to η^2 and even for the most strongly birefringent natural crystals is very narrow Δθph ≃ 1° (rutile) and Δθph ≃4° (calomel). However the physically more important group velocity interval is substantially larger (proportional to η). Calculations give Δθgr ≃ 7° for rutile, and Δθgr ≃ 20° for calomel.
