Magnetooptic Recording
The  write/erase  mechanism  of  the  magnetooptical  (MO)  recording  system  is  based  on  a  thermomagnetic
process in a perpendicularly magnetized magnetooptic ﬁlm. A high-power pulsed laser is focused to heat up a
small  area  on  the  magnetooptic  medium.  The  coercive  force  of  the  MO  layer  at  room  temperature  is  much
greater than that of a conventional non-MO magnetic recording medium. However, this coercive force is greatly
reduced when the heated spot is raised to a critical temperature. Application of a bias magnetic ﬁeld can then
easily reverse the polarization direction of the MO layer within the heated spot. As a result, a very small magnetic
domain  with  magnetization  opposite  to  that  of  the  surrounding  area  is  generated.  This  opposite  magnetic
domain will persist when the temperature of the medium is lowered. The magnetization-reversed spot represents
one bit of stored data. To erase data, the same thermal process can be applied while reversing the direction of
the bias magnetic ﬁeld.
