where V is the voltage rating (V), P is the power rating (W), and R is the resistance (W). For a given value of
voltage  and  power  rating,  a  critical  value  of  resistance  can  be  calculated.  For  values  of  resistance  below  the
critical value, the maximum voltage is never reached; for values of resistance above the critical value, the power
dissipated is lower than the rated power (Fig. 1.10).
