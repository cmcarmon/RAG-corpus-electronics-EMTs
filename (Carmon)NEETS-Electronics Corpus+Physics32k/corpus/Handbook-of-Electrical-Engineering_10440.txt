The  identiﬁcation  algorithm  A  maps  both  a  priori  and  a  posteriori  information  to  a  candidate  nominal
model. In this case, the algorithm is said to be tuned to the a priori information; otherwise, if it only depends
on  the  experimental  data,  it  is  called  untuned.  Almost  all  classical  parameter  identiﬁcation  algorithms  ([6])
belong to the latter class.
