The actual useful power of any traction engine can be calculated using a dynamometer to measure torque and rotational speed, with peak power sustained when the transmission and/or operator keeps the product of torque and rotational speed maximised. For jet engines there is e be usefully calculated there, for rockets there is typically no cruise speed, so it is less meaningful.
Peak power of a traction engine occurs at a rotational speed higher than the speed when torque is maximised and at or below the maximum rated rotational speed â€“ Max RPM. A rapidly falling torque curve would correspond with sharp torque and power curve peaks around their maxima at similar rotational speed, for example a small, lightweight engine with a large turbocharger. A slowly falling or near flat torque curve would correspond with a slowly rising power curve up to a maximum at a rotational speed close to Max RPM, for example a large, heavy multi-cylinder engine suitable for cargo/hauling. A falling torque curve could correspond with a near flat power curve across rotational speeds for smooth handling at different vehicle speeds, such as a traction electric motor.
