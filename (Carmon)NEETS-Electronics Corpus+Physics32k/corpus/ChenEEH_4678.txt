Although simple in nature, we emphasize that this model
encompasses the essential dynamics needed for control design.
Note that the model is constructed in the crank angle domain
instead of the time domain. Because the engine inherently
divides its continuous physical processes into four distinct
events (intake, compression, power, and exhaust), representa-
tion of the engine dynamics in the crank angle domain (as
opposed to the time domain) is intuitively appealing and has
certain advantages for control purposes, particularly for the
idle speed control problem (Yurkovich and Simpson, 1997;
Chin and Coats, 1986).
