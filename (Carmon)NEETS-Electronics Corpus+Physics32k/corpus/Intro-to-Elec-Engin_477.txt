transistors and diodes, as well as resistors and capacitors, on a very small chip (no larger than a
pencil eraser). The variety of ICs available to process digital signals can contain a few to several
thousand components on a single chip. A convenient method of digital IC classiÔ¨Åcation, based
on the number of components per chip, is as follows:
