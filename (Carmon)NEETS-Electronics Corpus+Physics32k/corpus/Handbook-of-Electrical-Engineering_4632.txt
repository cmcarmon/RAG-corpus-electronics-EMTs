where  Km  is  an  effective  spring  constant,  M  the  mass,  and  Rm  the  mechanical  resistance.  For  a  piezoelectric
transducer [Eq. (46.9)] Tem is inversely proportional to frequency; hence from Eqs. (46.10) and (46.11) we see
that a piezoelectric transducer will have a ﬂat receiving sensitivity below resonance (i.e., where its behavior is
controlled  by  stiffness).  On  the  other  hand,  a  moving  coil  microphone  must  have  a  resistive  mechanical
impedance to have a ﬂat response. From Eq. (46.12) we derive the fundamental tenet of loudspeaker design,
that a moving coil loudspeaker will have a ﬂat transmitting current response above resonance (i.e., where it is
mass  controlled).  Accordingly,  moving  coil  loudspeakers  are  designed  to  have  the  lowest  possible  resonant
frequency (by means of a high compliance since the output is inversely proportional to the mass) and piezo-
electric hydrophones are designed to have the highest possible resonant frequency.
