As a result of this sharing process, the valence electrons are held tightly together. This can best be
illustrated by the two-dimensional view of the silicon lattice in figure 1-8. The circles in the figure
represent the nuclei of the atoms. The +4 in the circles is the net charge of the nucleus plus the inner
shells (minus the valence shell). The short lines indicate valence electrons. Because every atom in this
pattern is bonded to four other atoms, the electrons are not free to move within the crystal. As a result of
this bonding, pure silicon and germanium are poor conductors of electricity. The reason they are not
insulators but semiconductors is that with the proper application of heat or electrical pressure, electrons
can be caused to break free of their bonds and move into the conduction band. Once in this band, they
wander aimlessly through the crystal.
