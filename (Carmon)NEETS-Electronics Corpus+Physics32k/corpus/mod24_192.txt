Fiber sensitivity to bending losses can be reduced. If the refractive index of the core is increased,
then fiber sensitivity decreases. Sensitivity also decreases as the diameter of the overall fiber increases.
However, increases in the fiber core diameter increase fiber sensitivity. Fibers with larger core size
propagate more modes. These additional modes tend to be more lossy.
