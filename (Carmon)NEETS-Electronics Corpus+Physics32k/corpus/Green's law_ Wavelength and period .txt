Further, from Green's analysis, the wavelength



λ


{\displaystyle \lambda }
of the wave shortens during shoaling into shallow water, with






λ

g

h



=

constant



{\displaystyle {\frac {\lambda }{\sqrt {g\,h}}}={\text{constant}}}

along a wave ray. The oscillation period (and therefor also the frequency) of shoaling waves does not change, according to Green's linear theory.
