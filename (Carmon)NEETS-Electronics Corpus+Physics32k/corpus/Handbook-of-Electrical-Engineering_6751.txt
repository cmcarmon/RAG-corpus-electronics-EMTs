Some management functions are distributed across the LAN and are implemented at a low level. To recover
after the failure of a dual-ﬁber cable, stations automatically enter into a procedure to reconﬁgure around the
failure and reestablish connectivity. Although such procedures can be viewed as station management, they are
sometimes speciﬁed as part of the MAC sublayer, because they are so tightly integrated with media access.
