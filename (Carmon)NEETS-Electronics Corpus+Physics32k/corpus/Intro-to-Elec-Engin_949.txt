11.3.3 A 100-kVA, 2300:230-V, 60-Hz, single-phase
transformer has the following parameters: R1 =
0.30 , R2 = 0.003 , RC1 = 4.5 k, X1 =
0.65 , X2 = 0.0065 , and Xm1 = 1.0 k,
where subscripts 1 and 2 refer to high-voltage and
low-voltage sides, respectively. Set up the equiv-
alent T-circuit of the transformer and determine
the input current, input voltage, input power, and
power factor when the transformer is delivering
75 kW at 230 V and 0.85 lagging power factor.
11.3.4 A 150-kVA, 2400/240-V, 60-Hz, single-phase
transformer has the following parameters: R1 =
0.2 , R2 = 0.002 , X1 = 0.45 , X2 =
0.0045 , RC = 10 k, and Xm = 1.55 k,
where the notation is that of Figure 11.3.4. Form
the equivalent T-circuit of the transformer re-
ferred to the high-voltage side, and calculate the
supply voltage on the high-voltage side when the
transformer supplies rated (full) load at 240 V
and 0.8 lagging power factor.
