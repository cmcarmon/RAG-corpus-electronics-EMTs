Direct Broadcast Satellites
The  direct  broadcast  satellites  (DBS)  concept  is  to  transmit  programming  directly  to  homes  using  a  small
receive-only antenna via high-powered satellites. Through the use of a high-powered satellite, a small receive-
only satellite antenna may be used for home reception, with the ultimate goal to offer antennas less than one
foot  in  diameter.  High-powered  DBS  satellites  use  high-powered  transponders,  i.e.,  60â€“120  W.  To  prevent
interference into the small receive antennas at these high power levels, the DBS satellites will be spaced further
apart in geosynchronous orbit.
