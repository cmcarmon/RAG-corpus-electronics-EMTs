The spectrum analyzer accepts an electrical input signal and displays the frequency and amplitude of
the signal on a CRT. On the vertical, or Y, axis, the amplitude is plotted. The frequency would then be
found on the horizontal, or X, axis. The overall pattern of this display (figure 6-42) indicates the
proportion of power present at the various frequencies within the spectrum (fundamental frequency with
sideband frequencies).
