A surface covered with ice, of course, is tremendously difference than even storm-driven water. Purely from a collision avoidance and acoustic propagation, a submarine needs to know how close it is to the bottom of ice. Less obvious is the need to know the three-dimensional structure of the ice, because submarines may need to break through it to launch missiles, to raise4 electronic masts, or to surface the boat. Three-dimensional ice information also can tell the submarine captain whether antisubmarine warfare aircraft can detect or attack the boat.
The state of the art is providing the submarine with a three-dimensional visualization of the ice above: the lowest part (ice keel) and the ice canopy. While sound will propagate differently in ice than liquid water, the ice still needs to be considered as a volume, to understand the nature of reverberations within it.
