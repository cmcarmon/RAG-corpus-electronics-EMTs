The first single-stage audio amplifier is shown in figure 1-23. This circuit is a class A, 
common-emitter, RC-coupled, transistor, audio amplifier. C1 is a coupling capacitor that couples the 
input signal to the base of Q1. R1 is used to develop the input signal and provide bias for the base of Q1. 
R2 is used to bias the emitter and provide temperature stability for Q1. C2 is used to provide decoupling 
(positive feedback) of the signal that would be developed by R2. R3 is the collector load for Q1 and 
develops the output signal. C3 is a coupling capacitor that couples the output signal to the next stage. VCC 
represents the collector-supply voltage. Since the transistor is a common-emitter configuration, it provides 
voltage amplification. The input and output signals are 180ยบ out of phase. The input and output impedance 
are both medium.
