The largest plasma display product ever manufactured (prior to 1997) uses the Fig. 83.28 structure and has
a diagonal of 60 in. with a 2048 Â· 2048 array of more than 4 million pixels [Wedding et. al., 1987]. This display
operates at a very high update rate so that it will work with a standard NTSC video source. The memory feature
allows this display to have the same luminance as the smaller page sized displays.
