A spherical (or possibly hyperbolic) photosensitive cathode helped correct for the distortion inherent
in  aiming  the  electron  beam  over  a  relatively  wide  dispersion  to  scan  the  whole  “screen”.  The  basic

of radar screens, television tubes, and now computer monitors. (Copyright © 1995, DewRay Products,
