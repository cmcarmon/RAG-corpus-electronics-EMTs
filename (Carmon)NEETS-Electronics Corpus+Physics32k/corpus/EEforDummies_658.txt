With the pot set to 1 MΩ, I measured a base current of 6.7 μA (that’s 
0.0000067 A) and a collector current of 0.94 mA. Dividing the collector cur-
rent by the base current, I found that the current gain of this transistor cir-
cuit is 140. With the pot set to 0 Ω, I measured a base current of 0.65 mA and 
a collector  current of 14 mA, for a current gain of approximately 21.5. Pretty 
intense!
