Wideband CDMA
The 3G air interface standardization for the schemes based on
CMA focuses on two main types of wideband CDMA: net-
work asynchronous and network synchronous. In network
asynchronous schemes, the base stations are not synchronized;
in network synchronous schemes, the base stations are syn-
chronized to each other within a few microseconds.
