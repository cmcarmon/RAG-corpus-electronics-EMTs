Insulators
The electrical operating performance of a transmission line depends primarily on the insulation. Insulators not
only  must  have  sufﬁcient  mechanical  strength  to  support  the  greatest  loads  of  ice  and  wind  that  may  be
reasonably expected, with an ample margin, but must be so designed to withstand severe mechanical abuse,
lightning, and power arcs without mechanically failing. They must prevent a ﬂashover for practically any power-
frequency  operation  condition  and  many  transient  voltage  conditions,  under  any  conditions  of  humidity,
temperature,  rain,  or  snow,  and  with  accumulations  of  dirt,  salt,  and  other  contaminants  which  are  not
periodically washed off by rains.
