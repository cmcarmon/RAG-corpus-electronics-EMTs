Speed limits in Croatia are regulated by the Road Traffic Safety Act (Croatian: Zakon o sigurnosti prometa na cestama).
Four general speed limits apply on Croatian roads:
50 km/h (31 mph) within inhabited places, or up to 80 km/h (50 mph) where explicitly permitted
90 km/h (56 mph) outside inhabited places
110 km/h (68 mph) on expressways (brza cesta)
130 km/h (81 mph) on freeways (autocesta)
Lower speed limits apply to buses, heavy, trailer and towing vehicles, and tractors.
Due to legal requirements for speed measuring, the speed limits for expressways and freeways are de facto 133 km/h (83 mph) and 155 km/h (96 mph), respectively. The limits shown above apply only if there are no other signs present, as the signs may prescribe a lower or a higher speed limit (limits of 100 km/h or higher can also be found within inhabited places). The lowest legal speed limit under normal traffic conditions is 40 km/h (25 mph).
Depending on the severity of the violation, driving faster than the speed limit is punishable by a fine in the amount between HRK 300 and 15,000 (€40–2000). Exceeding the speed limit by more than 50 km/h in a populated area may also be punished by imprisonment of up to 60 days.
