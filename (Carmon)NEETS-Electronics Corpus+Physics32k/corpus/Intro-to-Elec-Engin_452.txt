Inductorless (Active) Filters
Filters (used to pass or eliminate certain frequency components of a signal) that are suitable
for IC fabrication, but which do not contain inductors, are known as active Ô¨Ålters. They have
the op amp as a common component. Figure 5.4.13 shows the basic op-amp circuit with
frequency-dependent impedances. The voltage gain or voltage transfer function of this circuit
is given by
