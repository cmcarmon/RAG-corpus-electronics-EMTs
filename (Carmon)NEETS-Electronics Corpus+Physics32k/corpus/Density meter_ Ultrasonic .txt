Ultrasonic density meters work on various principles to calculate the density. One of the methods is transit-time principle (also known as the time of flight principle). In this technique, two transducers are mounted to the sides of the pipe walls. The transducers alternate between sending and receiving ultrasonic signals. From this transit time measurement, the flow velocity and volume flow based on the diameter of the pipe are calculated.
Another method this is used is ultrasonic attenuation method. This method measures the count of various signals with certain amplitudes. The density of the media flowing through the pipe affects the signal sent through the pipe. This changes the strength of the signal, causing a weaker signal and smaller amplitude.
Another method that is utilized in ultrasonic meters is the envelope energy average method. This method is based on not only the amplitude of the signal but also the shape of the signal. These packets of information are called envelopes.
Doppler ultrasonic meters measure the suspension flow where the concentration of solids in the slurry is above 100ppm and the particles that are suspended are larger than 100 microns in diameter. However, the Doppler method only works on concentrations of less than 10% solids.
