Protons, neutrons, nuclei and other composite baryonic particles have magnetic moments arising from their spin (both of which may be zero). Conventionally, the associated g-factors are defined using the nuclear magneton, and thus implicitly using the proton's mass rather than the particle's mass as for a Dirac particle. The formula used under this convention is

{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\mu }}=g{\mu _{\text{N}} \over \hbar }{\boldsymbol {I}}=g{e \over 2m_{\text{p}}}{\boldsymbol {I}},}

where μ is the magnetic moment of the nucleon or nucleus resulting from its spin, g is the effective g-factor, I is its spin angular momentum, μN is the nuclear magneton, e is the elementary charge and mp is the proton rest mass.
