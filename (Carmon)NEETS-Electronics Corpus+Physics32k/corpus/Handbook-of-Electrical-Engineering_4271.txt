Modulated versions include frequency-modulated (FM/CW), interrupted frequency-modulated (IFM/CW),
and phase-modulated. Typical waveforms are indicated in Fig. 41.7. Such systems are used in altimeters, Doppler
navigators, proximity fuzes, over-the-horizon radar, and active seekers for terminal guidance of air-to-surface
missiles. The term continuous is often used to indicate a relatively long waveform (as contrasted to pulse radar
using short pulses) or a radar with a high duty cycle (for instance, 50% or greater, as contrasted with the typical
duty cycle of less than 1% for the usual pulse radar). As an example of a long waveform, planetary radars may
transmit  for  up  to  10  hours  and  are  thus  considered  to  be  CW  [Freiley  et al.,  1992].  Another  example  is
interrupted CW (or pulse-Doppler) radar, where the transmitter is pulsed at a high rate for 10 to 60% of the
total time [Nathanson, 1991]. All of these modulated CW radars are able to measure range.
