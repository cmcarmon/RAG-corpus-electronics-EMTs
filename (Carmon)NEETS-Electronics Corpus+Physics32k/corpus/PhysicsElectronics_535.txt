The JFET has two distinct modes of operation: the variable-resistance mode, and the
pinch-oﬀ mode. In the variable-resistance mode the JFET behaves like a resistor whose value
is controlled by VGS. In the pinch-oﬀ mode, the channel has been heavily constricted with
most of the drain-source voltage drop occuring along the narrow and therefore high-resistance
part of the channel near the depletion regions.
