Time Constant
Since the exponential factor only approaches zero as t increases without limit, such functions theoretically last
forever. In the same sense, all radioactive disintegrations last forever. In the case of an exponentially decaying
current, it is convenient to use the value of time that makes the exponent â€“1. When t = t = the time constant,
the value of the exponential factor is
