I.D. Systems provides a variation of its industrial vehicle management system designed specifically for ground support equipment (pushback tractors, baggage tugs, cargo loaders, catering vans, fuel trucks, etc.) and other vehicles that operate in and around airports.
This system, branded AvRamp®, was developed with funding from the U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and tested by the TSA at Newark Liberty International Airport and the JAXPORT seaport in Jacksonville, Florida. According to a 2005 TSA report, "The Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) Vehicle Tracking Demonstration—Wireless Fleet Management System," I.D. Systems' technology accurately located vehicles and enhanced the security of aircraft fuel trucks and other maintenance vehicles.
The company's customers in the airport vehicle management market include Envoy Air and American Airlines.
