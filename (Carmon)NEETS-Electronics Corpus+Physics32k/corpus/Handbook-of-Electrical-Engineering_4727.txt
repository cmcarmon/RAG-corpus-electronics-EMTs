When  an  acoustic  wave  meets  a  discontinuity  or  a  mismatch,  part  of  the  wave  is  reﬂected.  For  an  incident
mode, an interface represents a lumped impedance. If the medium on the other side of the interface is inﬁnitely
deep, that lumped impedance is the characteristic impedance of the second medium. However, if the second
medium is of ﬁnite depth h in the direction of propagation and it in turn is terminated by a lumped impedance
ZL2 the impedance seen by the incident wave at the interface is given, as in transmission line theory, by
