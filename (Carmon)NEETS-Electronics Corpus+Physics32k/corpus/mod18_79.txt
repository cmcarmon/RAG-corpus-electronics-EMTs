phase can be predetermined to create an orderly scanning pattern that covers the entire vertical plane.
Electronic scanning permits automatic compensation for an unstable radar platform (site), such as a ship
at sea. Error signals are produced by the roll and pitch of the ship and are used to correct the radar beam
to ensure complete elevation coverage.
