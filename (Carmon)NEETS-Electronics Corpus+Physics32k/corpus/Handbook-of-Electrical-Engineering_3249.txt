Practically speaking, lasers contain three key elements. One is the laser medium itself, which generates the
laser  light. A  second  in  the  power  supply,  which  delivers  energy  to  the  laser  medium  in  the  form  needed  to
, which concentrates the light to stimulate the
excite it to emit light. The third is the optical cavity or 
emission  of  laser  radiation.  All  three  elements  can  take  various  forms,  and  although  they  are  not  always
immediately evident in all types of lasers, their functions are essential. Figure 31.1 shows these elements in a
ruby and a helium-neon laser.
