First, replace the (sinusoidal) sources by their complex (or real)
amplitudes. For example, the input voltage vA = Va cos(ωt) is replaced
by its real amplitude Va.
boxes, inductors by Ls boxes, and capacitors by 1/Cs boxes. Here s = jω.
The resulting diagram is called the impedance model of the network.
