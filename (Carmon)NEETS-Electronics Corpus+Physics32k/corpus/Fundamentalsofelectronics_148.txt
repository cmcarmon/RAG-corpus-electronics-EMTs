One interesting simple circuit (Figure 3.9) has two resistors connected side-by-side, what we will term a
parallel connection, rather than in series. Here, applying KVL reveals that all the voltages are identical:
v1 = v and v2 = v. This result typiÔ¨Åes parallel connections. To write the KCL equation, note that the top
