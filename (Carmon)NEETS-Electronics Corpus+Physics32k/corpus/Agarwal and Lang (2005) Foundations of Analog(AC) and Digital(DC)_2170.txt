Thus far we have used the Op Amp in its active region. In the active region, the
voltage-controlled voltage source model of the Op Amp shown in Figure 15.6
applies. Furthermore, when negative feedback is applied, and the Op Amp is
operated in the active region, we can use the input voltage constraint given
by v
. However, the voltage-controlled voltage source model and the
input voltage constraint no longer apply when the Op Amp output reaches
saturation. In saturation, the Op Amp output will be close to one of the power
supply voltages, +12 or −12 V. In positive saturation, the output will be close
to +12 V and in negative saturation the output will be close to −12 V.
