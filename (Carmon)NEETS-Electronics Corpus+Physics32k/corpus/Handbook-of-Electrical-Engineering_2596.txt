Another  difference  between  the  current-voltage  curves  for  short  devices  and  those  for  long  devices  is  the
dependence on gate voltage. For long devices, the current level in saturation, ID,sat, increases quadratically with
gate bias. The reason is that the number of carriers in the channel is proportional to  VG – VTH (where VTH is
the  threshold  voltage),  as  is  discussed  later,  the  channel  resistance  Rch (cid:181)  1/(VG  – VTH),  and  the  drain  bias  in
saturation is approximately VG. Thus, ID,sat = VD/Rch (cid:181) (VG  – VTH)2, and we have quadratic dependence. When
