You learned earlier that transmitters may be simple with low power (milliwatts) capabilities. These 
may be used to send voice messages a short distance. You may also use highly sophisticated units that use 
thousands (even millions) of watts of power to send many channels of data (for example voice, 
teletypewriter, television, telemetry) simultaneously over long distances. Let's look at a complete 
transmitter set.
