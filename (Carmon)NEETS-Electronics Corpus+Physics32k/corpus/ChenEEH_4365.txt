In this example, the number of changes in the sign of the
coefﬁcients in the ﬁrst column is two. This means that there
are two roots with positive real parts. Note that the result is
unchanged when the coefﬁcients of any row are multiplied or
divided by a positive number to simplify the computation. If
the polynomial in the present example is the denominator of a
closed-loop transfer function, the corresponding system will be
unstable.
