Assume an exhaust velocity of 4,500 meters per second (15,000 ft/s) and a

v


{\displaystyle \Delta v}
of 9,700 meters per second (32,000 ft/s) (Earth to LEO, including

to overcome gravity and aerodynamic drag).

= 0.884, therefore 88.4% of the initial total mass has to be propellant. The remaining 11.6% is for the engines, the tank, and the payload.
Two-stage-to-orbit: suppose that the first stage should provide a

= 0.671, therefore 67.1% of the initial total mass has to be propellant to the first stage. The remaining mass is 32.9%. After disposing of the first stage, a mass remains equal to this 32.9%, minus the mass of the tank and engines of the first stage. Assume that this is 8% of the initial total mass, then 24.9% remains. The second stage should provide a

= 0.648, therefore 64.8% of the remaining mass has to be propellant, which is 16.2% of the original total mass, and 8.7% remains for the tank and engines of the second stage, the payload, and in the case of a space shuttle, also the orbiter. Thus together 16.7% of the original launch mass is available for all engines, the tanks, and payload.
