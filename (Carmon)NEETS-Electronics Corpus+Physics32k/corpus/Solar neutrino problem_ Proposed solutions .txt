Early attempts to explain the discrepancy proposed that the models of the Sun were wrong, i.e. the temperature and pressure in the interior of the Sun were substantially different from what was believed. For example, since neutrinos measure the amount of current nuclear fusion, it was suggested that the nuclear processes in the core of the Sun might have temporarily shut down. Since it takes thousands of years for heat energy to move from the core to the surface of the Sun, this would not immediately be apparent.
Helioseismology observations made it possible to measure the interior temperatures of the Sun; these agreed with the well established standard solar model. Furthermore, detailed observations of the neutrino spectrum from the more advanced neutrino observatories produced results which no adjustment of the solar model could accommodate: While the overall lower neutrino flux (which the Homestake experiment results found) required a reduction in the solar core temperature, details in the energy spectrum of the neutrinos required a higher core temperature. This happens because different nuclear reactions, whose rates have different dependence upon the temperature, produce neutrinos with different amounts of energy. All adjustments that could be made to the solar model worsened some aspect of the discrepancies.
