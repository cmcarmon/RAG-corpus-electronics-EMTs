It is important to remember that in the forward biased condition, conduction is by MAJORITY
current carriers (holes in the P-type material and electrons in the N-type material). Increasing the battery
voltage will increase the number of majority carriers arriving at the junction and will therefore increase
the current flow. If the battery voltage is increased to the point where the barrier is greatly reduced, a
heavy current will flow and the junction may be damaged from the resulting heat.
