The communication interface is the module through which the acquired data are sent as well as other control tasks
are  established  between  the  data  acquisition  module  and  the  host  computer  (Fig.  84.1).  There  are  basically  two
different ways of establishing a data link between the two. One way is to use interrupts and the other is through
direct memory access
 (DMA). In the case of an interrupt-driven mode, an interrupt-request signal is sent to the
computer. Upon receiving it, the computer will ﬁrst ﬁnish the execution of the current instruction, suspend the
next, and then send an interrupt-acknowledge signal asking the module to send data. The operation is asynchronous
since  the  sender  sends  data  when  it  wants  to  do  so.  Getting  the  computer  ready  to  receive  data  is  known  as
handshaking. In the case of a DMA transfer, the DMA controller is given the starting address of the memory location
where the data have to be written. The DMA controller asks the computer to freeze its operations until it has ﬁnished
writing data directly into the memory. The operation does not need any waiting time and therefore it is fast.
