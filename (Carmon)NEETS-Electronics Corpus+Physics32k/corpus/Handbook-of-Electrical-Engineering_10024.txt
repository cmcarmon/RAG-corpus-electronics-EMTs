The block diagram represents an “ideal” relay position control system with velocity feedback. The plant is a
double  integrator,  ignoring  viscous  (linear)  friction,  hysteresis  in  the  relay,  or  backlash  in  the  gearing.  If  the
system output is denoted by x1 and its derivative by x2, then the relay switches when –x1 –x2 = –1; the equations
of the dotted lines are marked switching lines on Fig. 100.53.
