Over the years, the fundamentals of electrical engineering have
evolved to include a wide range of topics and a broad range of
practice. To encompass such a wide range of knowledge, the
handbook focuses on the key concepts, models, and equations
that enable the electrical engineer to analyze, design, and
predict the behavior of electrical systems. While design formu-
las and tables are listed, emphasis is placed on the key concepts
and theories underlying the applications.
