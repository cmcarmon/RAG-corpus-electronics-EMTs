	
In	the	previous	chapter,	the	formulas	for	the	calculation	of	a	circuit’s	resistance	levels
were	shared.	However,	the	formulas	for	the	calculation	of	the	entire	load	in	a	circuit	have
yet	to	be	discussed.
This	is	due	to	the	significance	of	using	the	appropriate	measurement	units.	In	a	few	cases,
especially	those	who	are	still	on	the	initial	phase	of	learning	circuits?	They	aren’t	quite
careful	with	their	selected	units.	As	it	follows,	it’s	not	only	necessary	to	calculate	a
circuit’s	electric	flow;	it’s	also	necessary	to	calculate	a	circuit’s	flow	correctly.
