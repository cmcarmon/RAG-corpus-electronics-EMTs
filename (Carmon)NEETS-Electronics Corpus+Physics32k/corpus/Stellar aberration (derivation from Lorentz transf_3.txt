For the derivation it is assumed, that the light signal only travels through space regions where the gravitation field is negligible. Hence is suffices to use special relativity and the path of the light signal is a straight line in any inertial frame of reference.
Observation in the rest frame S of the center of mass of our Solar System
The rest frame of the center of mass (barycenter) is a very good quasi-inertial frame of reference for periods of time in the order of thousands of years, since our solar system needs about 230 million years (galactic year) to move completely around the center of the Milky Way. The space coordinates of this frame of reference form a Cartesian coordinate system.

In reference frame S the light signal starts at

Observation in the inertial frame of reference S' which is in uniform motion (relative to S) along the x-axis
The origin of the reference frame S' is in uniform motion relative to S with

{\displaystyle (v|0|0)}
, i.e. moves along the x-axis, and the x-,y- und z-axes of S' and S are parallel to each other and at time

S' now is an equally good quasi-inertial frame of reference as S: the space coordinates form a Cartesian coordinate system and the path of the light signal is a straight line.
