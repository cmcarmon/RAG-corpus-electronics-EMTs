have small bandwidths while short pulses have large bandwidths. This agrees qualitatively with
the rectangular pulse spectrum of Figure 14.1.4(b), although it ignores the components above
f = 1/D. In order to preserve the square corners of the rectangular pulse shape, we would have
to take W >> 1/D.
