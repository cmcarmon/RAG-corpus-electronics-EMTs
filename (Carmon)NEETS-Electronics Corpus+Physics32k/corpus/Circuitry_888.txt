Thus:  
 
(5) 
(cid:4)T =(cid:4)JC + (cid:4)CS + (cid:4)SA = (cid:4)JA 
 
The  complete  electrical  equivalent  circuit  of  the 
heatsink arrangement is shown in Fig. 19.37. Note 
that 
the 
semiconductor  device  and  the  ‘potentials’  at  the 
two  extreme  ends  of  the  series  chain  of  thermal 
resistances  are  TJ (junction  temperature)  and  TA
(ambient or surrounding air temperature).
