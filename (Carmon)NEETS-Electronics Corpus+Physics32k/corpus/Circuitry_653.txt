The  type  of  display  used  in  digital  multi-range 
meters is either the liquid crystal display (LCD) or 
the  light  emitting  diode  (LED).  The  former  type 
requires  very  little  electrical  power  and  thus  is  to 
be  preferred  on  the  grounds  of  low  battery 
consumption.  LCD  displays 
are,  however, 
somewhat  difficult  to  read  under  certain  light 
conditions  and,  furthermore,  the  display  response 
can be rather slow. LED displays can be extremely 
bright  but  unfortunately  consume  considerable 
power  and  this  makes  them  unsuitable  for  use  in 
battery-powered portable instruments.
