Do not attempt to break blisters or to remove shreds of tissue or adhered particles of charred 
clothing. Never apply a greasy substance (butter, lard, or petroleum jelly), antiseptic preparations, or 
ointments. These may cause further complications and interfere with later treatment by medical 
personnel.
