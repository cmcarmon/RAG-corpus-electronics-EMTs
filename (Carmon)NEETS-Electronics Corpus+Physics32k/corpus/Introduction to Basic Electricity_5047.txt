To use the tray method, the copper-clad board with 
applied resist is etched in a glass tray by  placing the 
board onto the surface of the acid. The copper side 
of the board should face toward the acid. Float it on 
the acid for approximately 15 to 20 minutes. The acid 
laden with copper sinks to the bottom, and fresh acid 
replaces it. In this fashion, no agitation is required.
