Development of very high efﬁciency tandem PV cells for use with concentrated solar power provided the
other major stimulus for renewed interest in TPV. Two designs were particularly important in that they took
the  approach  of  developing  low  bandgap  booster  cells  of  GaSb  or  GaxIn1–xAs  for  use  under  existing  high-
performance devices [9–11]. Both GaSb and Ga0.47In0.53As have bandgaps of about 0.7 eV, corresponding to a
