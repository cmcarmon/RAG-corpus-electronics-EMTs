MODULATORâ€”A circuit used in servo systems to convert a dc signal to an ac signal. The
output ac signal is a sine wave at the frequency of the ac reference voltage. The amplitude of
the output is directly related to the amplitude of the dc input. The circuit's function is
opposite to that of a DEMODULATOR.
