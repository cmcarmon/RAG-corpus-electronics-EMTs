. Session initiation: Initiating a session is perhaps the
hardest part because it requires determining where the
user to be contacted is residing at the current moment:
the user may be at home working on a home PC or may be
at work on an ofﬁce PC. Thus, SIP allows users to be located
and addressed by a single global address (usually an e-mail
address) irrespective of the user’s physical location.
