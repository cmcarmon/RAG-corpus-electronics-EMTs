Since the discontinued use of the nonﬂammable polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), a number of unsaturated
synthetic liquids have been developed for application to capacitors, where due to high stresses evolved gases
may readily undergo partial discharge. Most of these new synthetic capacitor ﬂuids are thus gas-absorbing low-
molecular-weight derivatives of benzene, with permittivities ranging from 2.66 to 5.25 at room temperature
(compared to 3.5 for PCBs). None of these ﬂuids have the nonﬂammable characteristics of the PCBs; however,
they do have high boiling points [Bartnikas, 1994].
