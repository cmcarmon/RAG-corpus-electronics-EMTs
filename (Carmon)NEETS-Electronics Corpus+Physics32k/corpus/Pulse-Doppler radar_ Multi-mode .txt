Pulse-Doppler radar must be multi-mode to handle aircraft turning and crossing trajectory.
Once in track mode, pulse-Doppler radar must include a way to modify Doppler filtering for the volume of space surrounding a track when radial velocity falls below the minimum detection velocity. Doppler filter adjustment must be linked with a radar track function to automatically adjust Doppler rejection speed within the volume of space surrounding the track.
Tracking will cease without this feature because the target signal will otherwise be rejected by the Doppler filter when radial velocity approaches zero.
Multi-mode operation may also include continuous wave illumination for semi-active radar homing.
