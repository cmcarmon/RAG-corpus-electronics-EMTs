A tropical depression or tropical low is a tropical disturbance that has a clearly defined surface circulation with maximum sustained winds of less than 34 kn (39 mph; 63 km/h). Within the Southern Hemisphere, the depression can have gale force or stronger winds in one or more quadrants, but not near the centre.
