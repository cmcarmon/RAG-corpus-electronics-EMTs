 
who  takes  a  course  in  physics  or  even  general  science  is—or  at  least  should
very  high  school  student
be—familiar with the ﬁrst-order, linear electrical effects such as resistance, inductance, capacitance, etc.
The more esoteric effects, however, are often neglected, even in otherwise comprehensive undergraduate
electrical engineering curricula. These effects, though, are not only fascinating in their manifestations but are
also  potentially—and  in  some  cases,  currently—exceedingly  useful  in  application.  This  section  will  describe
many of these higher-order electrical and magnetic effects and some of the devices that are based upon them.
Readers are invited not only to study the current applications but to let their imaginations extrapolate to other
uses as yet unproposed.
