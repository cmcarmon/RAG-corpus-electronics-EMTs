Recall that when the astable multivibrator was first energized, it was impossible to predict which 
transistor would initially go to cutoff because of circuit symmetry. The one-shot circuit is not symmetrical 
like the astable multivibrator. Positive voltage VBB is applied through R5 to the base of Q1. This positive 
voltage causes Q1 to cut off. Transistor Q2 saturates because of the negative voltage applied from âˆ’VCC 
to its base through R2. Therefore, Q1 is cut off and Q2 is saturated before a trigger pulse is applied, as 
shown in figure 3-12. The circuit is shown in its stable state.
