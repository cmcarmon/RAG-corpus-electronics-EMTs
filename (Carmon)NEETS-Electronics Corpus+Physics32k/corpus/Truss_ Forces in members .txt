Illustrated is a simple, statically determinate flat truss with 9 joints and (2 x 9) âˆ’ 3 = 15 members. External loads are concentrated in the outer joints. Since this is a symmetrical truss with symmetrical vertical loads, the reactive forces at A and B are vertical, equal, and half the total load.
The internal forces in the members of the truss can be calculated in a variety of ways, including graphical methods:
