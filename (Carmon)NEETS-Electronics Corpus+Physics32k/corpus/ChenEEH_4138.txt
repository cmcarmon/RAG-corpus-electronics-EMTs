If the synchronization in the receiver is not precise for any of
the above operations, then the bit error rate of the receiver will
not be the same as described by the equations in the previous
sections. The design of a receiver is an area that standards have
traditionally not speciﬁed. It is usually an art that enables one
company to offer better performance in its equipment com-
pared to a competitor’s equipment. The methods of achieving
synchronization discussed in this section are the traditional
methods. A particular receiver may or may not use any of these
methods. Many companies use proprietary methods.
