In large, permanently installed battery banks, batteries are equipped with vent caps above
each cell, and hydrogen gas is vented outside of the battery room through hoods immediately
over the batteries. Hydrogen gas is very light and rises quickly. The greatest danger is when
it is allowed to accumulate in an area, awaiting ignition.
