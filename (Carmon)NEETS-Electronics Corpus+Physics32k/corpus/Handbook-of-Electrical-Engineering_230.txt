When superposition is used, the controlled sources are left on in all cases as independent sources are turned
on and off, thus reï¬‚ecting the kinship of controlled sources to the circuit elements. In principle, little complexity
is  added;  in  practice,  the  repeated  solutions  required  by  superposition  entail  much  additional  work  when
controlled sources are involved.
