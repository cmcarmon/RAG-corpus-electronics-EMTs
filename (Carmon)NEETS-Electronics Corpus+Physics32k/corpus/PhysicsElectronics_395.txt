When diodes are used in small-signal applications – a few volts – their behaviour is not
closely approximated by the ideal model because of the PN turn-on voltage. The equivalent
circuit model can be used to evaluate the detailed action of the rectiﬁer under these condi-
tions. During the part of the wave when the input is positive but less than the PN turn-on
voltage, the model predicts no loop current and the output signal voltage is therefore zero.
