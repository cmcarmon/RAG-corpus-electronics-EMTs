We need to choose an appropriate value for C that 
is  in  the  range  stated  earlier.  Since  we  require  a 
fairly low value of p.r.f. we will choose a value for 
C of 1µF. This should help to ensure that the value 
of R is neither too small nor too large. A value of  
1 µF should also be easy to  obtain. Making R the 
subject of the formula and substituting for C = 1 µF 
gives:
