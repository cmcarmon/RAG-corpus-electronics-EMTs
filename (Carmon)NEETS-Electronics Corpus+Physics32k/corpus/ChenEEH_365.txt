The width of the depletion region is wider at the drain end
since the source is grounded and a Ô¨Ånite bias is applied to the
drain. At small drain biases, the channel is conductive from
source to drain. However, the width of the channel is smaller at
the drain end due to the wider depletion region. The depletion
region width under the gate is given by:
