After the circuit design (schematic capture) and analysis, Step 1 in the process is to determine whether all
SMDs will be used in the Ô¨Ånal design making a Type I board, or whether a mix of SMDs and through-hole
parts will be used, leading to a Type II or Type III board. This decision will be governed by some or all of the
following considerations:
