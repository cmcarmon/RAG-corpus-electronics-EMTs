Therefore, when we want to send signals over any distance,
baseband signaling is not
therefore
modulate the signals onto a radio frequency (RF) carrier.
When we transmit the digital bit stream, we convert the bit
stream into the analog signal: a(t ) cos (vt Ã¾ u). The character-
istic of this signal has amplitude a(t), frequency v=2p, and
phase u; thus, we can change any of the three characteristics
to formulate the modulation method. The basic form of the
