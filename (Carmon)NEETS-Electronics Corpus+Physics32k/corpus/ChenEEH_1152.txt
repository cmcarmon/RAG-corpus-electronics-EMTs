In the last decade, it was shown that scanning instruments
with very sharp tips could modify surfaces as well as make
images of them, both on an atomic scale. The techniques
involve the use of scanning tunneling or atomic force micro-
scopes called proximal probes. The ability to make a dot with
several atoms or molecules of a material (a bit) at a location on a
surface raises the possibility of producing integrated MEMS
devices that could store terabits of information in a square
centimeter. Such a density would exceed the projected capabil-
ities of magnetic storage. Hence, MEMS technology holds the
possibility of displacing part of the giant hard disk market.
Thousands of ﬁne tips would be employed in a square centi-
meter. Each tip would be mounted on a micromachined and
electrostatically actuated mechanism that can be independently
scanned in two dimensions, as sketched in Figure 6.17. Tips
would ﬁrst write bits and later sense their presence or absence,
analogous to the function of the magnetic head in a disk drive.
