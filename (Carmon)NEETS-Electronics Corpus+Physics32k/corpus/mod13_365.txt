Clocks have been mentioned in the preceding section with regard to their action with FFs. You will
recall that the clock is a timing signal generated by the equipment to control operations. This control
feature is demonstrated in both the D and J-K FFs. Remember that the clock output had to be in a certain
condition for the FFs to perform their functions.
