Always check the condition of the test set batteries by disconnecting the test set power cord, placing
the POLARITY switch in the PNP position and placing the FUNCTION switch first to BAT.1, then to
BAT.2. In both BAT positions the meter pointer should move so as to indicate within the red BAT range.
