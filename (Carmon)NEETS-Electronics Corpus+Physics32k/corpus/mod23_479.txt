The interleave factor applies only to hard disk drives. They spin at 3600 RPM, a very fast speed 
compared to floppy disk drives which only spin at 300-600 RPM. Interleave indicates how many physical 
sectors are between sequentially numbered logical sectors on a hard disk. It's used when the magnetic 
heads and the control circuitry can't process the data fast enough to sequentially number the sectors on a 
hard disk platter. With interleave, the magnetic head is told to skip X number of sectors to get to the next 
one. For example, a hard disk with 17 sectors per track and no interleave is numbered 1, 2, 3, 4.... 17. The 
same hard disk with an interleave factor of 3 is numbered 1, 7, 13, 2, 8, 14, 3, 9, 15, 4, 10, 16, 5, 11, 17, 6,
