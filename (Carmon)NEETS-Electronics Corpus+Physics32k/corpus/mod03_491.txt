An ACCURATE SNAP-ACTING SWITCH is a snap-acting switch in which the operating point is
pre-set and very accurately known. The operating point is the point at which the plunger causes the switch
to "switch." The accurate snap-acting switch is commonly called a MICROSWITCH. A microswitch is
shown in figure 3-13.
