	
Thank	you	again	for	downloading	this	book!	
I	hope	this	book	was	able	to	help	you	understand	the	fundamentals	in	circuit	engineering.
The	 lessons	 shared	 to	 you	 here	 are	 meant	 for	 a	 beginner	 in	 the	 subject;	 the	 different
discussions	are	written	simply.	And,	so	far,	it	may	have	dawned	on	you	that	there’s	still
more	to	discover	about	circuits.
The	next	step	is	to	learn	even	more	about	circuitry	and	circuit	engineering.	Especially	if
you’re	considering	a	career	in	the	field,	advanced	lessons	would	be	good.	Since	this	book
has	introduced	you	to	the	subject,	and	maybe	inspired	you	to	see	the	fun	side	in	circuits,	as
well	 as	 electronics	 and	 electrical	 engineering,	 you	 may	 want	 to	 take	 the	 beginner’s
perspective	to	a	whole	other	level.
Finally,	if	you	enjoyed	this	book,	please	take	the	time	to	share	your	thoughts	and	post	a
review	on	Amazon.	It’d	be	greatly	appreciated!
Thank	you	and	good	luck!
