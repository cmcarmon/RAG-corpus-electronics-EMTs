Adders
Table 8.1 compares the REMOD method for adders to other
methods of fault tolerance. For REMOD adders, multiplexer
forwarding was used, and data are presented both for cell
output comparison and for output parity comparison (Dutt
and Hanchek, 1997). Since most of the available information
concerning area overheads for the various fault tolerance
methods is given in terms of transistor counts, comparisons
are made using these numbers.
