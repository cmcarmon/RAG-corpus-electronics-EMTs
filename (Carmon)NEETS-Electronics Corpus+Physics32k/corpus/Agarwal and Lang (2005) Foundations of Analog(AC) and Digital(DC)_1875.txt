Now, generalizing from these results, the relations among complex amplitudes
of voltages and currents for any linear RLC network can be found by replacing
the (sinusoidal) sources by their complex (or real) amplitudes, and replacing
resistors by R boxes, capacitors by 1/Cs boxes, and inductors by Ls boxes. The
resultant diagram is called the impedance model of the circuit. The complex
voltages and currents in circuits can now be found by standard linear circuit
analysis: Node Equations, Thévenin’s theorem, etc.
