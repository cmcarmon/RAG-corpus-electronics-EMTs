The purpose of the MAGNET is to produce a fairly uniform magnetic field of the desired value over
the interaction space between the cathode and plate of the magnetron. The strength of the magnet is
critical for proper operation. If the magnetic field strength is too high, the magnetron will not oscillate. If
the magnetic field strength is too low, the plate current will be excessive and power output will be low.
Frequency of operation will also be affected.
