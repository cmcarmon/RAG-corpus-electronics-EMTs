For the purpose of integrating the optical isolator component into the same substrate with the semiconductor
laser to facilitate monolithic fabrication, integrated waveguide optical isolators become one of the most exciting
areas for research and development. In a waveguide isolator, the rotation of the polarization is accomplished
in a planar or channel waveguide. The waveguide is usually made of a magnetooptic thin ﬁlm, such as YIG or
BIG ﬁlm, liquid phase epitaxially grown on a substrate, typically gadolinium-gallium-garnet (GGG) crystals.
Among the many approaches in achieving the polarization rotation, such as the 45-degree rotation type or the
