solution for millimeter-wave circuits. Figure 7.29(D) shows a
planar dielectric resonator that is compatible with a conven-
tional lithographic fabrication process for planar circuits. The
resonance takes place around the circular aperture area of the
dielectric substrate while the remaining dielectric surfaces are
metallized. This structure offers a very good Q value at milli-
meter-wave frequencies while it is compatible with coplanar
waveguide or slot lines realized on the same substrate.
