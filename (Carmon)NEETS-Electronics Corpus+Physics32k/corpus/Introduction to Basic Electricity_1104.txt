 Always protect your eyes, lungs and extremities 
when using power tools. Wear the protective gear shown 
in Figure 8-6. The Occupational Safety and Health Ad-
ministration, OSHA, requires that any workers exposed 
to hazards of falling, flying, splashing objects or any-
thing that can be inhaled, must use personal protective 
gear when in the work space. It doesnâ€™t take much for an 
object in the eye to become a major irritation. It is better 
to cut a glove than skin. When working around fumes, 
wear the appropriate mask. Never wear long hair, loose 
clothing, ties or jewelry around power tools as they can 
get caught in the actions of the power tools.
