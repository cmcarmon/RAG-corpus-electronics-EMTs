During the expansion process, a variety of test are run to analyze the aerodynamic and thermal properties of the test vehicle.
Skin friction
The drag that is created when an object travels through a fluid, such as a liquid or gas.
Flow chemistry
The analysis of reactions that take place during a continuous flow.
Durability
The ability to withstand deterioration.
Turbulence
The disordered movement of fluids.
Heat transfer
The thermal energy transfer from one system to another.
Aero elastic
The forces created by the movement of air and the manner in which air bends around the object.
Thermal protection
The ability to withstand heat transfer, reducing the temperature.
Vibration
The oscillation, or shaking, of the molecules.
