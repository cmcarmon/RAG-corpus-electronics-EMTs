The function of an oscillator is to produce a sinusoidal waveshape of a specific frequency and 
amplitude. In doing so, the stability of an oscillator is very important. Depending on its application, an 
oscillator may be required to have either good frequency stability or amplitude stability; in many 
circumstances, both are required. Of the two, good frequency stability is usually considered more 
important.
