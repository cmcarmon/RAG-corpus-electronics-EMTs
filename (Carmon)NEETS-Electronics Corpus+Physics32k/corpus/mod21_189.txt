You commonly experience static build-up during the winter months when you walk across a vinyl or
carpeted floor. (Synthetics, especially plastics, are excellent generators of static electricity.) If you then
touch a doorknob or any other conductor, an electrical arc to ground may result, and you may receive a
slight shock. For you to experience such a shock, the electrostatic potential created must be 3,500 to 4,000
volts. Lesser voltages, although present and similarly discharged, normally are not apparent to your
nervous system. Some typical measured static charges caused by various actions are shown in table 2-1.
