Do not attempt to simplify a spreadsheet by using 
lots of formatting, bold lines, and lots of color. Rather, 
use the fewest number of cells necessary to produce 
the result that flows from top to bottom and left to 
right, and position related cells close together on one 
sheet. Above all, keep the spreadsheet simple.
