A simple mnemonic rule for memorizing Voigt notation is as follows:
Write down the second order tensor in matrix form (in the example, the stress tensor)
Strike out the diagonal
Continue on the third column
Go back to the first element along the first row.
Voigt indexes are numbered consecutively from the starting point to the end (in the example, the numbers in blue).
