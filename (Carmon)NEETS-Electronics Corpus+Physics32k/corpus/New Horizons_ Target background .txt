Mission planners searched for one or more additional Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) of the order of 50–100 km (31–62 mi) in diameter as targets for flybys similar to the spacecraft's Plutonian encounter, but, despite the large population of KBOs, many factors limit the number of possible targets. Because the flight path is determined by the Pluto flyby, and the probe only has 33 kilograms of hydrazine remaining, the object to be visited needs to be within a cone, extending from Pluto, of less than a degree's width. This ruled out any possibility for a flyby of Eris, a trans-Neptunian object comparable in size to Pluto. It will also need to be within 55 AU, because beyond 55 AU, the communications link will become too weak, and the RTG power output will have decayed significantly enough to hinder observations. Desirable KBOs would be well over 50 km (30 mi) in diameter, neutral in color (to compare with the reddish Pluto), and, if possible, have a moon that imparts a wobble. After a search along New Horizon's flight path using the Hubble Space Telescope, only three KBOs were found in range, and one of those objects was later dropped from consideration.
