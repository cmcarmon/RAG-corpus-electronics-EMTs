Method of superposition: Circuits with multiple sources
of the same frequency can be solved by using the mesh or
nodal analysis method on the phasor circuit at the source
frequency. Alternatively, the principle of superposition in
linear circuits can be applied. First, solve the phasor circuit
for each independent source separately. Then add the response
voltages and currents from each source to get the total re-
sponse. Since the responses are at the same frequency, phasor
addition is valid.
