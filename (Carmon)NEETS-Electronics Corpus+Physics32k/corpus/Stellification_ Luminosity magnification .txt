The fusion reaction of stars is strongly dependent upon temperature. For proton-proton reactions such as found in Earth's sun, the reaction rate scales with the fourth power of temperature (T4). For other reactions such as the CNO cycle, the proportionality can be as high as T20. Thus, increasing the temperature of the star even a small amount (for example by using reflective solar sails), would create a large increase in power output, resulting in a much higher equilibrium temperature, and therefore luminosity, of the star.
