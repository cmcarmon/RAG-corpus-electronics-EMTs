To troubleshoot your circuit, you should first mark up your circuit diagram 
with component values, estimated voltage levels at various points in the 
circuit, and expected current levels in each branch of the circuit. (Often the 
process of marking up the diagram uncovers a math error or two.) Then use 
your multimeter to probe around.
