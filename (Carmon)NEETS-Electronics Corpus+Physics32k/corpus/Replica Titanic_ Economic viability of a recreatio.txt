In 1998, Popular Mechanics magazine explored the feasibility of such projects, in consultation with Neil Gallagher of the Webb Institute. The article discussed the significant changes to the original design required to produce a safe and economically viable ship. Most of the changes would appear below the water line:
Welded, not riveted, hull
Bulbous bow for greater fuel efficiency
Enlarged rudder and bow thrusters for increased maneuverability
Horizontal stabilizers
Diesel electric generation and propulsion would free up the cavernous space used by Titanicâ€™s 159 coal furnaces and 29 boilers
Vacated space could be used for waste processing, water treatment, and air conditioning.
Extra funnels not needed for diesel generator exhaust would be dummy funnels. The economic feasibility was more uncertain. The engineering challenges would drive the construction costs to approximately twice the cost of a modern cruise ship.
