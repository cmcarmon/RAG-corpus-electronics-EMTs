A short circuit has 0 ohms resistance. In reality, the 
short may not be 0 ohms but is lower than what should 
be measured and is assumed to be zero resistance. A 
short circuit is the term used to identify an unintended 
connection or a defective component with 0 ohms 
resistance. When measuring voltage across a shorted 
component, the voltage will read 0 volts. When mea-
suring the resistance of a shorted component, the re-
sistance will be 0 ohms. Shorts in power equipment 
are dangerous because they can result in electrical fires 
due to a high current flow, especially if the circuit is 
not fused (Figure 50-10).
