i n v e r t e r The circuit shown in Figure 11.23 is the same as that shown in
Figure 11.13 except that the inverter in Figure 11.23 is a CMOS inverter. As in Exam-
ple 11.3, we wish to approximate the average power dissipated in the inverter given
that vIN is a 100-MHz square wave. Again, we will assume that the on-state resis-
tance of both MOSFETs is so small that the switching transients of the inverter fully
settle.
