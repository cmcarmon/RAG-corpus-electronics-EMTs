Traditional FDA approaches are based on so-called hard-
ware redundancy where extra components are used as backup
in case of failures. Because of the additional cost, space, weight,
and complexity of incorporating redundant hardware, model-
based methods (in the spirit of analytical redundancy) with
inexpensive and high performance microprocessors have dom-
inated the FDA research activities. The major reason for the
prevalence of this approach is information processing tech-
niques using powerful computing devices and memory
systems can be used to establish the necessary redundancy
without the need of hardware instrumentation in the system
(Polycarpou and Helmicki, 1995). Under the model-based
analytical redundancy, system behaviors are compared with
the analytically obtained values
through a mathematical
model. The resulting differences are so-called residuals (Gert-
ler, 1988). In the ideal situation, the residuals will be zeros in
the fault-free system, and any deviation will be interpreted as
an indication of faults. This is rarely true, however, in practice
with the presence of measurement noise disturbances and
modeling errors. The deviation can be the combinational
results of noises, disturbances, modeling errors, and faults.
Naturally, with the presence of signiÔ¨Åcant noises, statistical
analysis of the residuals becomes a reasonable procedure to
generate a logical pattern called the signature of the failure for
