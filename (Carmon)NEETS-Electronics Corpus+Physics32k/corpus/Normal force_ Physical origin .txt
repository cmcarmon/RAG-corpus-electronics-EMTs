As explained before, the normal force is a contact force, that is, the resultant of the forces between the constituents of the actual constraint, and the constituents of the object. When the object and the constraint (a wall, a table, another object, or any surface) are pressed against each other, the van der Waals force, a force that grows very large very quickly, opposes this and for this reason, the two objects cannot penetrate each other. If the two objects are then separated, even by a very small distance, the normal force disappears. This is because the intermolecular force quickly vanishes past the point of equilibrium.
