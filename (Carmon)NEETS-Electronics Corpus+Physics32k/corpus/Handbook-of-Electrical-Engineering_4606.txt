For decades, the frequencies of radio transmitters have been stabilized with “crystals.” In recent years, the
—in which a mechanical strain induces an electric ﬁeld and vice versa—has found
effect called 
many other applications. Like ferroelectrics, piezoelectric materials can be either crystalline or polycrystalline
and can be fabricated in a variety of shapes.
