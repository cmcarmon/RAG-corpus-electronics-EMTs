The process of discretization can also be viewed as a way of modeling
physical systems. The resistor is a model for a lightbulb if we are interested in
finding the current flowing through the lightbulb for a given applied voltage.
It can even tell us the power consumed by the lightbulb. Similarly, as we will
see in Section 1.6, a constant voltage source is a good model for the battery
when its internal resistance is zero. Thus, Figure 1.4b is also called the lumped
circuit model of the lightbulb circuit. Models must be used only in the domain
in which they are applicable. For example, the resistor model for a lightbulb
tells us nothing about its cost or its expected lifetime.
