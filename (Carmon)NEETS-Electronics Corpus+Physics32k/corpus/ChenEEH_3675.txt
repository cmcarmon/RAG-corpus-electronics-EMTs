in which {un} is the unit step sequence; the signal
is an
appropriate impulse response for
the ﬁlter. An all-pole
impulse–response model for {gn} (regardless of the number
of poles used), however, is incapable of producing the realistic
pulse shapes that are observed in many experiments because an
all-pole model is constrained to be of minimum phase (other-
wise it would be unstable). More realistic pulse signals have
been suggested in the literature. The Rosenberg pulse [18] is
given by:
