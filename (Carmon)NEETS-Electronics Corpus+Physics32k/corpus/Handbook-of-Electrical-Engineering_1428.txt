where  the  set  of  N  samples,  s(n),  may  have  ﬁrst  been  multiplied  by  a  window  function. An  example  of  the
magnitude of a 512-point DFT of the waveform of the /i/ from Fig. 15.10 is shown in Fig. 15.10. Note for this
ﬁgure, the 512 points in the sequence have been multiplied by a Hamming window deﬁned by
