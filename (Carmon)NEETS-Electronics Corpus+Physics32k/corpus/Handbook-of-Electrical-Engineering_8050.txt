Implementation. Rather  than  continuously  stopping  and  resetting  external  counters,  it  is  possible  to  take
advantage of features often found in modern microcontrollers, microprocessors containing additional interface
circuitry.  Microcontrollers  often  contain  counters,  timers,  and capture registers.  Capture  registers  allow  the
storing of timer or counter values triggered by an external signal. At the start of evaluation, the rising edge of
the next encoder pulse triggers the capture of the timer count and the pulse count. After a minimum evaluation
time has elapsed, the next encoder pulse again triggers the capture of the current counter values. The rotational
speed can then be computed using the difference between the captured values. A ï¬‚owchart of the algorithm is
shown in Fig. 82.3.
