Another way of deriving some sort of electromagnetic mass was based on the concept of radiation pressure. In 1900, Henri Poincaré associated electromagnetic radiation energy with a "fictitious fluid" having momentum and mass

.


{\displaystyle m_{em}={\frac {E_{em}}{c^{2}}}\,.}

By that, Poincaré tried to save the center of mass theorem in Lorentz's theory, though his treatment led to radiation paradoxes.
Friedrich Hasenöhrl showed in 1904, that electromagnetic cavity radiation contributes the "apparent mass"

{\displaystyle m_{0}={\tfrac {4}{3}}{\tfrac {E_{em}}{c^{2}}}}

to the cavity's mass. He argued that this implies mass dependence on temperature as well.
