The second condition that has to be satisfied for substructure assembly is the force equilibrium for matching interface forces




g



{\displaystyle \mathbf {g} }
. For the current example, this condition can be written as





g


2


A


=
−


g


2


B




{\displaystyle \mathbf {g} _{2}^{A}=-\mathbf {g} _{2}^{B}}
. Similar to the compatibility equation, the force equilibrium condition can be expressed using a Boolean matrix. Use is made of the transpose of the Boolean localisation matrix




L



{\displaystyle \mathbf {L} }
that was introduced to write compatibility:






L


T



g

=

0


⇒



{





g


1


A


=

0







g


2


A


+


g


2


B


=

0







g


3


B


=

0









{\displaystyle \mathbf {L} ^{T}\mathbf {g} =\mathbf {0} \quad \Rightarrow \quad {\begin{cases}\mathbf {g} _{1}^{A}=\mathbf {0} \\\mathbf {g} _{2}^{A}+\mathbf {g} _{2}^{B}=\mathbf {0} \\\mathbf {g} _{3}^{B}=\mathbf {0} \end{cases}}}

The equations for





g


1




{\displaystyle \mathbf {g} _{1}}
and





g


3




{\displaystyle \mathbf {g} _{3}}
state that the interface forces on internal nodes are zero, hence not present. The equation for





g


2




{\displaystyle \mathbf {g} _{2}}
correctly establishes the force equilibrium between a matching pair of interface DoFs according to Newton's third law.
A second notation in which the equilibrium condition can be expressed is by introducing a set of Lagrange multipliers




λ



{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\lambda }}}
. The substitution of these Lagrange multipliers is possible as





g


2


A




{\displaystyle \mathbf {g} _{2}^{A}}
and





g


2


B




{\displaystyle \mathbf {g} _{2}^{B}}
differ only in sign, not in value. Using again the signed Boolean matrix




B



{\displaystyle \mathbf {B} }
:





g

=
−


B


T



λ


⇒



{





g


1


A


=

0







g


2


A


=

λ







g


2


B


=
−

λ







g


3


B


=

0









{\displaystyle \mathbf {g} =-\mathbf {B} ^{T}{\boldsymbol {\lambda }}\quad \Rightarrow \quad {\begin{cases}\mathbf {g} _{1}^{A}=\mathbf {0} \\\mathbf {g} _{2}^{A}={\boldsymbol {\lambda }}\\\mathbf {g} _{2}^{B}=-{\boldsymbol {\lambda }}\\\mathbf {g} _{3}^{B}=\mathbf {0} \\\end{cases}}}

The set




λ



{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\lambda }}}
defines the intensity of the interface forces





g


2




{\displaystyle \mathbf {g} _{2}}
. Each Lagrange multiplier represents the magnitude of two matching interface forces in the assembly. By defining the interface forces




g



{\displaystyle \mathbf {g} }
using Lagrange multipliers




λ



{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\lambda }}}
, force equilibrium is automatically satisfied. This can be seen by substituting




g

=
−


B

T




λ



{\displaystyle \mathbf {g} =-\mathbf {B^{T}} {\boldsymbol {\lambda }}}
into the first equilibrium equation:






L


T



g

=
−


L


T




B


T



λ

=

0


∀


g




{\displaystyle \mathbf {L} ^{T}\mathbf {g} =-\mathbf {L} ^{T}\mathbf {B} ^{T}{\boldsymbol {\lambda }}=\mathbf {0} \quad \forall \mathbf {\mathbf {g} } }

Again, the nullspace property of the Boolean matrices is used here, namely:





L

T





B

T



=

0



{\displaystyle \mathbf {L^{T}} \mathbf {B^{T}} =\mathbf {0} }
.
The two conditions as presented above can be applied to establish coupling / decoupling in a myriad of domains and are thus independent of variables such as time, frequency, mode, etc. Some implementations of the interface conditions for the most common domains of substructuring are presented below.
