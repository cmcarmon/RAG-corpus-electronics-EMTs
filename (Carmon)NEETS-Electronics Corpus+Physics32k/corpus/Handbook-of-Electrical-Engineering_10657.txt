Transducers  convert  one  form  of  energy  to  another.  To  be  useful  for  an  electronic  instrument,  a  transducer
must produce an electrical output such as voltage or current to allow required signal conditioning and signal
processing steps to be completed. A variety of transducers are available to meet a measurement requirement;
some  common  examples  are  listed  in  Table 108.2.  Transducers  can  be  compared  based  on  their  operating
principles, the measurand range, interface design, and reliability. Khazan [1994] gives a complete summary of
transducer schemes.
