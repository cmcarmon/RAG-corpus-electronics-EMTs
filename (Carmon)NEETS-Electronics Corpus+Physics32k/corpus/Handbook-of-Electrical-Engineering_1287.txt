Subsequence Restoration
It  is  possible  to  obtain  further  performance  improvements  in  modeling  data  as  a  linear  combination  of
exponentials by employing the concept of data decimation. As an example, any data sequence may be decom-
posed into two subsequences that are composed of its even and odd samples, respectively. If the data under
analysis is exactly modeled as a linear combination of exponential signals, it is a simple matter to establish that
the associated even and odd decimated subsequences are similarly characterized. The component exponentials
in the even and odd decimated subsequences are found to equal the square of those in the original data. This
decomposition procedure can be continued in an obvious fashion to generate an additional three subsequences,
each  of  which  is  composed  of  every  third  sample  of  the  original  data,  and  so  forth.  This  data  decimation
procedure  has  been  combined  with  the  signal  restoration  technique  presented  in  this  subsection  to  effect
improved  estimation  performance.  The  interested  reader  will  Ô¨Ånd  this  approach  described  in  Cadzow  and
Wilkes [1991].
