In chapter 1 you learned that the two digits of the binary number system can be represented by the
state or condition of electrical or electronic devices. A binary 1 can be represented by a switch that is
closed, a lamp that is lit, or a transistor that is conducting. Conversely, a binary 0 would be represented by
the same devices in the opposite state: the switch open, the lamp off, or the transistor in cut-off.
