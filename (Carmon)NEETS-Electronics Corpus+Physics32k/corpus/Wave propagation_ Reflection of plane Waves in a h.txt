The propagation and reflection of plane waves, i.e. Pressure waves (P-wave) or Shear waves (SH or SV-waves), in a homogeneous half-space have been of significant interest in the classical seismology. The analytical solution of this problem exists and has been used frequently in the literature for the verification purposes. The frequency domain solution pertaining to this problem can be obtained through the Helmholtz decomposition of the displacement field in the half-space and substitute into the Navier's equation.
