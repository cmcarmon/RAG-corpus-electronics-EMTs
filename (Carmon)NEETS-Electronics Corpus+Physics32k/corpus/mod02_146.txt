If two unlike charges are placed on opposite sides of an atom whose outermost electrons cannot escape
their orbits, the orbits of the electrons are distorted as shown in figure 3-3. Figure 3-3(A) shows the normal
orbit. Part (B) of the figure shows the same orbit in the presence of charged particles. Since the electron is a
negative charge, the positive charge attracts the electrons, pulling the electrons closer to the positive charge.
The negative charge repels the electrons, pushing them further from the negative charge. It is this ability of
an electrostatic field to attract and to repel charges that allows the capacitor to store energy.
