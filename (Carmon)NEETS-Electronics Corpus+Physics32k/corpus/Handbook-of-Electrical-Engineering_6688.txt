Network layer PDUs are called packets and data link layer PDUs are called frames. The data link layer does
not know that the information it is transmitting is a packet; to the data link layer entity, the packet is simply
user information. From the perspective of a data link entity, it is not necessary to have a network layer. The
network  layer  exists  to  add  value  for  the  user  of  the  network  layer  to  the  services  provided  by  the  data  link
layer. In the example above, value was added by the network layer by providing a relaying capability since Hosts
A and C were not directly connected. Similarly, the data link layer functions on a hop-by-hop basis, each hop
being completely unaware that there are any other hops involved in the communication. We will see later that
the data link need not be limited to a single physical connection.
