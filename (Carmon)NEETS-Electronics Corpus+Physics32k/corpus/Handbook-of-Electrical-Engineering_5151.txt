Nonlinear Electroacoustic Properties
Electroacoustic synergism is experienced in certain classes of materials in which the mechanical atomic vibrations
are inﬂuenced by the electronic polarizability, with the result that nonlinear interaction between the atomic dis-
placements versus the electric ﬁeld causes modulation effects resulting in the generation of new sideband frequencies.
Such sidebands (labeled Raman frequencies) and the response function of a Raman active medium have the form
