The  Cray  X-MP  and Y-MP  also  support  SSDs,  which  can  come  in  conﬁgurations  of  up  to  4096  Mbytes,
approximately four times the capacity of the DD-49. The SSD has the potential for enormous bandwidth. It
can be attached to the Cray IO system or directly to the CPU through up to two 1000-Mbyte/s channels. Access
can  be  arranged  in  one  of  three  ways  [Reinhardt,  1988].  The  ﬁrst  alternative  is  to  treat  the  SSD  as  a  logical
disk,  with  users  responsible  for  staging  heavily  accessed  ﬁles  to  it.  Unfortunately,  this  leads  to  the  inevitable
contention  for  SSD  space.  Further,  the  operating  system’s  disk  device  drivers  are  not  tuned  for  the  special
capabilities  of  SSDs,  and  some  performance  is  lost.  The  second  alternative  is  to  use  the  SSD  as  an  extended
memory, in much the same manner as IBM’s extended storage. Special system calls for accessing the SSD bypass
the usual disk-handling code, and a 4096-byte sector can be accessed in 25 ms. The last alternative is to use the
SSD as a logical device cache, i.e., as a second-level cache for multitrack chunks of ﬁles that resides between
the system’s in-main memory ﬁle cache and the physical disk devices. Cray engineers have observed workload
speedups  for  their  UNIX-like  operating  system  of  a  factor  of  four  over  conventional  disk  when  the  cache  is
enabled. These results indicate that SSDs are most appropriate for containing “hot spot” data [Gawlick, 1987].
Conventional wisdom has it that 20% of the data receives 80% of the accesses, and this has been widely observed
in transaction processing systems [Gawlick, 1987].
