A	primary	benefit	of	the	documentation	process	is	its	advantage	of	letting	you
identify	possible	errors	in	putting	together	a	circuit.		If	you	weren’t	successful	at
the	end	stage	of	your	project,	you	can	figure	out	exactly	where	you	went	wrong;	in
favor	of	having	to	disregard	your	current	progress	and	starting	from	scratch	the
second	time	around,	you	can	simply	have	certain	methods	modified	(for
improvement).
Verification,	as	defined	in	circuitry,	is	the	process	of	thoroughly	evaluating	each	of
a	circuit’s	components,	as	well	as	each	of	the	stages	in	the	making.	The	objective
is	to	determine	whether	the	process	has	been	adhered	to	correctly.	Usually,	this	can
be	a	time-consuming	process,	but	since	it	is	intend	to	ensure	quality,	it	is	an
important	one.
In	a	way,	the	real-world	version	of	the	verification	process	is	testing.	Prior	to	a
circuit’s	launch	and	its	exposure	to	different	commercial	industries,	it	is	tested	in
research	laboratories.	Like	verification,	it	can	also	be	a	time-consuming	process,
and	since	it	is	the	last	process	before	a	circuit	is	passed	on	to	another	source,	it	can
be	a	labor-intensive	series.
