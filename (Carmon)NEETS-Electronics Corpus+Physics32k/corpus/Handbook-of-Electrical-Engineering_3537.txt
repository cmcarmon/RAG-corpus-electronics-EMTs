high-speed designs operating at clock frequencies above 75 MHz. At such high frequencies, the transmission
line behavior of wires must be analyzed. A wire should be properly terminated, i.e., connected, to a port having
an impedance matching the wire characteristic impedance to prevent signal reﬂections. Signal reﬂections are
portions of an emanating signal that “bounce back” from the destination to the source. Signal reﬂections reduce
the power of the emanating signal and can damage the source. Crosstalk refers to unwanted reactive coupling
between physically adjacent signals, providing a connection between signals that are supposed to be electrically
isolated.  Ground  bounce  is  another  signal  integrity  problem.  Since  all  conductive  material  has  a  ﬁnite
impedance, a ground signal network does not in practice offer the exact same electrical potential throughout
an entire design. These potential differences are usually negligible because the distributive impedance of the
ground  signal  network  is  small  compared  with  other  ﬁnite-component  impedances.  However,  when  many
signals switch value simultaneously, a substantial current can ﬂow through the ground signal network. High
intermittent currents yield proportionately high intermittent potential drops, i.e., ground bounces, which can
