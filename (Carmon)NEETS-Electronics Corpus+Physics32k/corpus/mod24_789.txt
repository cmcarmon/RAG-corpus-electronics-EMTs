All fiber optic systems are simply sets of point-to-point fiber optic links. Different system topologies
arise from the different ways that point-to-point fiber optic links can be connected between equipments.
The term topology, as used here, refers to the configuration of various equipments and the fiber optic
components interconnecting them. This equipment may be computers, workstations, consoles, or other
equipments. Point-to-point links are connected to produce systems with linear bus, ring, star, or tree
topologies. Point-to-point fiber optic links are the basic building block of all fiber optic systems.
