A TORQUE DIFFERENTIAL SYNCHRO SYSTEM consists either of a TX, a TDX, (torque 
differential transmitter), and a TR; or two TXs and one TDR (torque differential receiver). The system is 
used in applications where it is necessary to compare two signals, add or subtract the signals, and finish 
an output proportional to the sum of or difference between the two signals.
