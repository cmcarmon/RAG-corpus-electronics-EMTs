The HLA system is a so-called parallel hydraulic hybrid. In parallel systems the original vehicle drive-line remains, allowing the vehicle to operate normally when the HLA system is disengaged. When the HLA is engaged, energy is captured and released during deceleration and acceleration respectively. This is in contrast to so-called series hydraulic hybrid systems which replaces the entire traditional drive-line to provide power transmission in addition to regenerative braking functions.
