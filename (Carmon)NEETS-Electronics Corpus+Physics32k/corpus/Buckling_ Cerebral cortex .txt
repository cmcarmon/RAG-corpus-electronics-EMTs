The mechanisms of cortical gyrification are just beginning to be understood. Mechanical buckling forces due to the expanding brain tissue probably cause the cortical surface to fold. This is an example of how pattern formation in nature can also take place due to elastic instabilities instead of the classical reaction-diffusion mechanism first proposed by Alan Turing.
