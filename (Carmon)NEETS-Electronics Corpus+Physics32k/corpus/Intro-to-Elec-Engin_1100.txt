The polyphase induction motor operates with polyphase alternating current applied to the
primary winding, usually located on the stator of the polyphase machines. Three-phase motors are
most used commercially in practice, whereas two-phase motors are used in control systems. The
induction machine has emf (and consequently current) induced in the short-circuited secondary
(or rotor) winding by virtue of the primary rotating mmf. Such a machine is then singly excited.
The induction machine may be regarded as a generalized transformer in which energy conversion
takes place, and electric power is transformed between the stator and the rotor along with a change
of frequency and a ï¬‚ow of mechanical power.
