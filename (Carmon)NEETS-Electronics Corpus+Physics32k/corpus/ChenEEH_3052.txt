terrain require the resolution of electrical, mechanical, mate-
rial, and civil engineering issues. Similarly, for high-voltage
cables, a different set of equally complex issues arise in design,
especially in the insulation that may even require pressurized
oil; installation underground in crowded downtown areas or
under water has its own challenges. Transmission is covered in
Chapter 5 and distribution in Chapter 6.
