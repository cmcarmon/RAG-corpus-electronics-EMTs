Our goal is to use the Taylor series method to expand the MOSFET SCS
equation for the combined input voltage given in Equation 8.4 about the bias
voltage VI. For our Taylor expansion, VI corresponds to Xo, x corresponds
to VI + vi, or x âˆ’ Xo corresponds to vi, and y corresponds to iD = ID + id.
Applying the Taylor expansion to Equation 8.4 about VI we get
