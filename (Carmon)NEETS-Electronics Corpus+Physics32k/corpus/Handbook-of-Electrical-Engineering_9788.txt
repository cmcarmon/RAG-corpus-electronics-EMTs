Forms of the Model
Regardless of whether a model is developed from knowledge of the physics of the process or from empirical
data ﬁtting, it can be further manipulated into several different but equivalent forms. This manipulation is box

be a circuit composed of one ideal source and an interconnection of ideal resistors, capacitors, and inductors.
