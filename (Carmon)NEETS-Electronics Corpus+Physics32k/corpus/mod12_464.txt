Assume that the voltages developed below resonance are such that the higher voltage on the anode of
CR2 causes C4 to charge to 8 volts. The lower voltage on the cathode of CR1 causes C3 to charge to 2
volts. Capacitor C5 remains charged to the sum of these two voltages, 10 volts. The output voltage equals
- 8 volts plus +5 volts, or - 3 volts, when tuned below resonance. During the negative half cycle of the
input signal, the diodes are reverse biased and C5 helps maintain a constant output.
