Input and output resistance 
 
Input resistance is the ratio of input voltage to input 
current and it is expressed in ohms. The input of an 
amplifier  is  normally  purely  resistive  (i.e.  any 
reactive component is  negligible) in the  middle of 
its working frequency range (i.e. the mid-band). In 
some cases, the reactance of the input may become 
appreciable  (e.g. 
large  value  of  stray 
capacitance  appears  in  parallel  with  the  input 
resistance). In such cases we would refer to input 
impedance rather than input resistance. 
  Output  resistance  is  the  ratio  of  open-circuit 
output voltage to short-circuit output current and is 
measured  in  ohms.  Note  that  this  resistance  is 
internal to the amplifier and should not be confused 
with the resistance of a load connected externally.     
  As  with  input  resistance,  the  output  of  an 
amplifier  is  normally  purely  resistive  and  we  can 
safely ignore any reactive component. If this is not 
the  case,  we  would  once  again  need  to  refer  to 
output impedance rather than output resistance. 
  Figure  7.8  shows  how  the  input  and  output 
resistances  are  ‘seen’  looking  into  the  input  and 
output 
respectively.  We  shall  be 
returning  to  this  equivalent  circuit  a  little  later  in 
this  chapter.  Finally,  it’s  important  to  note  that, 
although  these  resistance  are  meaningful  in  terms 
of  the  signals  present,  they  cannot  be  measured 
using a conventional meter!
