which must hold for all frequencies in the input signal x(t). Thus, a distortionless network will
have a constant amplitude ratio and a negative linear phase shift over the frequency range in
question.
When a low-pass signal having a bandwidth W is applied to a low-pass ﬁlter (see Section
3.4) with bandwidth B, essentially distortionless output is obtained when B ≥ W . Figure 14.1.6
illustrates the frequency-domain interpretation of distortionless transmission.
