Here, Q = R21,34/R32,41 if this ratio is greater than unity; otherwise, Q = R32,41/R21,34. A curve of f vs. Q, accurate
to  about  2%,  is  presented  in  Fig. 22.37  [van  der  Pauw,  1958]. Also  useful  is  a  somewhat  simpler  analytical
procedure for determining f, due to Wasscher and reprinted in Weider [1979]. First, calculate Î± from
