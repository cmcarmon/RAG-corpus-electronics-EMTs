7. Multidimensional sampling theorems. Multidimensional signals, such as images, require dimensional
extensions of the sampling theorem. The sampling of the signal now requires geometrical interpretation.
Uniform sampling of an image, for example, can either be done on a rectangular or hexagonal grid. The
minimum sampling density for one geometry may differ from that of another. The smallest sampling
density that does not result in aliasing can be achieved, in many cases, with a number of different uniform
sampling geometries and is referred to as the Nyquist density. Interestingly, sampling can sometimes be
performed below the Nyquist density with nonuniform sampling geometries such that the multidimen-
sional signal can be restored. Such is not the case for one dimension.
