Subband coders digitally ﬁlter the speech into nonoverlapping (as nearly as possible) frequency bands. After
ﬁltering, each band is decimated (effectively sampled at a lower rate) and coded separately using PCM, DPCM,
or  some  other  method. At  the  receiver,  the  bands  are  decoded,  upsampled,  and  summed  to  reconstruct  the
speech. By allocating a different number of bits per sample to the subbands, the perceptually more important
frequency bands can be coded with greater accuracy. The design and implementation of subband coders and
the speech quality produced have been greatly improved by the development of digital ﬁlters called quadrature
mirror ﬁlters (QMFs) [Johnston, 1980] and polyphase ﬁlters. These ﬁlters allow subband overlap at the encoder,
which  causes  aliasing,  but  the  reconstruction  ﬁlters  at  the  receiver  can  be  chosen  to  eliminate  the  aliasing  if
quantization errors are small.
