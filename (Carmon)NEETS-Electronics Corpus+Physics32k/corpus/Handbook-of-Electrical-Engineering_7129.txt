2 is independent of frequency and depends only on the slant range distance rs . The
gain of an antenna with an effective aperture area of 1 m2 is 10log(4p/l2), where the wavelength l = c/f, f is
the frequency in Hz, and c = 2.9979 · 108 m/s is the velocity of light. The dB sum of the spreading factor and
the gain of a 1-m2 antenna is the frequency-dependent “path loss”. “A” is the signal attenuation due to dissipative
losses in the propagation medium. B is the bandwidth in dB Hz, i.e., B = 10 log(b) where b is the bandwidth
in Hz.
