Figure 2-12 illustrates the ELECTRONIC TUNING (tuning by altering the repeller voltage) range 
and output power of a reflex klystron. Each mode has a center frequency of 3,000 megahertz which is 
predetermined by the physical size of the cavity. The output power increases as the repeller voltage is 
made more negative. This is because the transit time of the electron bunches is decreased.
