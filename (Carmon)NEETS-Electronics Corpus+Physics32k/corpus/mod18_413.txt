This technique produces an error signal when the target moves off the radiated beam axis in either
bearing or elevation. The error signal causes the antenna to move in the proper direction and for the
proper duration to cancel the error signal. This method of automatic tracking is commonly used by
weapons-control tracking radar systems.
