In a circuit
such as that shown in Figure 1.4b, the battery is rated at 7.2 V and 10000 J. Assume that
the internal resistance of the battery is zero. Further assume that the resistance in the
circuit is R = 1 k. You are given that the resistor can dissipate a maximum of 0.5 W
of power. (In other words, the resistor will overheat if the power dissipation is greater
than 0.5 W.) Determine the current through the resistor. Further, determine whether
the power dissipation in the resistor exceeds its maximum rating.
