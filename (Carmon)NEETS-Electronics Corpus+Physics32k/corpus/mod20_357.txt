MODULATORÂ—(1) A device that produces modulation; that is, a device that varies the amplitude, 
frequency, or phase of an ac signal [11] [12]. (2) A circuit used in servosystems to convert a dc signal 
to an ac signal. The output ac signal is a sine wave at the frequency of the ac reference voltage. The 
amplitude of the output is directly related to the amplitude of the dc input. The circuit's function is 
opposite to that of a DEMODULATOR [15]. (3) In radar, it produces a high-voltage pulse that turns the 
transmitter on and off [18].
