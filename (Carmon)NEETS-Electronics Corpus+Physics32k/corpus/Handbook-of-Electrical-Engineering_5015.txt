The 60-Hz breakdown strength of a 1-cm gap of air at 25(cid:176)C at atmospheric pressure is 31.7 kV cm–1. Although
this is a relatively low value, air is a most useful insulating medium for large electrode separations as is the case
for  overhead  transmission  lines.  The  only  dielectric  losses  in  the  overhead  lines  are  those  due  to  corona
discharges at the line conductor surfaces and leakage losses over the insulator surfaces. In addition, the highly
reduced  capacitance  between  the  conductors  of  the  lines  ensures  a  small  capacitance  per  unit  length,  thus
rendering  overhead  lines  an  efﬁcient  means  for  transmitting  large  amounts  of  power  over  long  distances.
Nitrogen,  which  has  a  slightly  higher  breakdown  strength  (33.4  kV  cm–1)  than  air,  has  been  used  when
compressed in low-loss gas-insulated capacitors. However, as air, which was also used in its compressed form
in  circuit  breakers,  it  has  been  replaced  by  sulfur  hexaﬂuoride,  SF6.  The  breakdown  strength  of  SF6  is  ca.
79.3 kV cm–1. Since the outside metal casing of metal-clad circuit breakers is ordinarily grounded, it has become
common practice to have much of the substation interconnected bus and interrupting switching equipment
insulated with SF6. To achieve higher breakdown strengths, the SF6 gas is compressed at pressures on the order
of 6 atm. The use of SF6 in substation equipment has resulted in the saving of space and the elimination of
line insulator pollution problems; however, its extensive usage has also posed some environmental concerns in
regard to its ﬂourine content.
