The active-region output resistance of the non-inverting Op Amp circuit can be
calculated in much the same way as for the inverting circuit. We set the indepen-
dent source to zero and apply a test current source to the output terminals, as
shown in Figure 15.13. Now calculate vt. As usual, we apply the node method
to find three independent equations. First find expressions for v
, and
then write KCL at the output node. Again we assume ri is much larger than R2
to simplify the math:
