An example of electromagnetic Ô¨Åeld effects in a digital
circuit is shown in Figure 9.15, which illustrates the results of
applying FDTD modeling to calculate the coupling and cross
talk of a high-speed logic pulse entering and leaving a micro-
chip embedded in a conventional dual
in-line integrated-
