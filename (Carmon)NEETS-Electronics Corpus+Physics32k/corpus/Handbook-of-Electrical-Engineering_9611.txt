Fault-tolerant systems rely on both hardware and software to ensure that the failure of any single hardware
component, or even multiple components, does not cause the system to cease operation. To build such a system
requires that each critical hardware component be replicated at least once. The operating system must be able
to dynamically determine which resources are available and, if a resource fails, move a running program to an
operational unit.
