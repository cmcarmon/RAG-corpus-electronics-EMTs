Use 22‐gauge solid‐strand hookup wire. The color doesn’t matter. Note 
that the potentiometer has three connections to it. One connection (at 
either end) goes to pin 7 of the 555; the other two connections (at the 
other end and the center) are joined, or bridged, and attached to the 
positive side of the power supply.
