The motion of a particle is described by the Smoluchowski limit of the Langevin equation  :

{\displaystyle dX_{t}={\sqrt {2D}}\,dB_{t}+{\frac {1}{\gamma }}F(x)dt}

where



D


{\displaystyle D}
is the diffusion coefficient of the particle,



γ


{\displaystyle \gamma }
is the friction coefficient per unit of mass,



F
(
x
)


{\displaystyle F(x)}
the force per unit of mass, and




B

t




{\displaystyle B_{t}}
is a Brownian motion.
