In equation 5.28, lg is the wavelength of the wave in an inﬁnite
medium having the same electrical property as the one inside
the waveguide. Below the cutoff, there is no expression for the
wavelength because the wave decays exponentially. The values
of x0
mn for the ﬁrst ﬁve values of m and n are reported in
Table 5.2.
