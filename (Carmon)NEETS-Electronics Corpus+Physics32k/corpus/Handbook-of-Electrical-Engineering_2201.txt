Consider  a  signal  that  is  one  sinusoid  modulated  by  another  sinusoid.  The  signal  has  been  sampled  at  a
frequency chosen to provide efﬁcient storage of the data. However, when plotting the data for further analysis,
we  want  to  interpolate  by  a  factor  of  8  so  that  the  signal  looks  smoother.  Therefore,  we  use  the  MATLAB
interpolation function. Figure 21.10 contains plots of the original and interpolated time signals. Figure 21.11
contains frequency plots to conﬁrm that the interpolation did not signiﬁcantly affect the frequency content.
Figure 21.12 contains the MATLAB code for this process.
