The action principle can be extended to obtain the equations of motion for fields, such as the electromagnetic field or gravity.
The Einstein equation utilizes the Einsteinâ€“Hilbert action as constrained by a variational principle.
The path of a body in a gravitational field (i.e. free fall in space time, a so-called geodesic) can be found using the action principle.
