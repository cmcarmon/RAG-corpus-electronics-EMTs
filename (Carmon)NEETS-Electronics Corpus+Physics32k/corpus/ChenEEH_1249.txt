Chapter 5, ‘‘Expert Systems,’’ by Yi Shang, covers four fun-
damental topics in expert systems—knowledge representation,
model- and case-based reasoning, knowledge acquisition, and
explanation of solution. An expert system is a computer pro-
gram that represents and uses knowledge of one or more
human experts to provide high-quality performance in a spe-
ciﬁc domain. Expert systems offer a number of beneﬁts when
compared with human experts. They are inexpensive to oper-
ate, easy to reproduce and distribute, and can provide perman-
ent documentation of the decision process. Most importantly,
expert systems can produce consistent results on the same
tasks and handle similar situations consistently.
