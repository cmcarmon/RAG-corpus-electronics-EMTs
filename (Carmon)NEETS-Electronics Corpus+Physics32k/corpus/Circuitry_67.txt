1.18   A current of 25 mA flows in a 47 < resistor. 
 
1.19   A  9  V  battery  supplies  a  circuit  with  a 
current of 75 mA. What power is consumed 
 
 
by the circuit? 
1.20   A resistor of 150 < is rated at 0.5 W. What 
is the maximum current that can be applied 
 
 
to the resistor without exceeding its rating? 
1.21   Determine  the  electric  field  strength  that 
 
appears  in  the  space  between  two  parallel 
plates separated by an air gap of 4 mm if a 
 
 
potential of 2.5 kV exists between them. 
1.22   Determine  the  current  that  must  be  applied 
to  a  straight  wire  conductor  in  order  to 
 
 
produce  a  flux  density  of  200  ÂµT  at  a 
 
distance of 12 mm in free space. 
1.23   A  flux  density  of  1.2  mT  is  developed  in 
free space over an area of 50 cm2. Determine 
 
 
the total flux present. 
1.24   A ferrite rod has a length of 250 mm and a 
 
the 
 
relative 
 
1.25   A  coil  of  400  turns  is  wound  on  a  closed 
mild steel core having a length 400 mm and 
 
cross-sectional area 480 mm2. Determine the 
 
current    required  to  establish  a  flux  of  0.6 
 
 
mWb in the core.
