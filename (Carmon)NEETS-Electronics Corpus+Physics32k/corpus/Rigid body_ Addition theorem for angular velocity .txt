The angular velocity of a rigid body B in a reference frame N is equal to the sum of the angular velocity of a rigid body D in N and the angular velocity of B with respect to D:










N






ω



B



=






N






ω



D



+






D






ω



B



.


{\displaystyle {}^{\mathrm {N} }\!{\boldsymbol {\omega }}^{\mathrm {B} }={}^{\mathrm {N} }\!{\boldsymbol {\omega }}^{\mathrm {D} }+{}^{\mathrm {D} }\!{\boldsymbol {\omega }}^{\mathrm {B} }.}

In this case, rigid bodies and reference frames are indistinguishable and completely interchangeable.
