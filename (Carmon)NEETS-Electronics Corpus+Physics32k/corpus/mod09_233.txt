Another frequency-determining device is the CRYSTAL. The crystal may be used with a tank 
circuit, or it may perform alone. Crystals exhibit a characteristic known as the PIEZOELECTRIC 
EFFECT. The piezoelectric effect is the property of a crystal by which mechanical forces produce 
electrical charges and, conversely, electrical charges produce mechanical forces. This effect is a form of 
oscillation similar to the flywheel effect of a tank circuit.
