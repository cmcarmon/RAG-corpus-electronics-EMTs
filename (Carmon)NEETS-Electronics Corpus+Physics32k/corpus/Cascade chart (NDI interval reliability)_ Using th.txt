There are two variables that play a role in the selection of the inspection interval using the cascade chart. These variables are the probability of detection over the lifetime of the structure and the confidence level for the stated probability. As one of the graph's axes is probability, it is fairly easy to find the data points that match a specific probability. In aerospace structural analysis, it is common to consider 99.9999% probability (0.0001% risk) to be improbable and 99.99999% probability (0.00001% risk) to be extremely improbable. Then, the confidence interval is used to select a point where a specified percentage of the data points lies to the right of the selected point. For example, a 95% confidence interval means that 95% of the simulated cases must fall to the right of this point. This specific point is marked, and the respective point on the x-axis represents the suggested inspection interval. Furthermore, to derive the estimated risk per flight hour, the risk percentage can be divided by the number of flight hours described in the inspection interval. Hopefully, using this process, the inspection interval will lead to a higher percentage of cracks being detected before failure, ensuring greater flight safety. A final important observation is that improving the NDI method can increase the number of flight hours needed before re-inspection while maintaining a relatively low risk level.
