As the speed of the processors increases, the dynamic
loading of the VRMs is also signiÔ¨Åcantly increased. Future
microprocessors are expected to exhibit higher current slew
rates of up to 5 A/ns. These slew rates represent a severe
problem for the large load changes that are encountered
when systems transfer from the sleep mode to the active
mode and vice versa. In these cases, the parasitic impedance
of the power supply connection to the load and the equivalent
series resistor (ESR) and equivalent series inductor (ESL) of
the capacitors have a dramatic effect on VRM voltage (Zhang
et al., 1996). If this impedance is not low enough, the supply
voltage may fall out of the required range during the transient
period. Moreover, the total voltage tolerance will be much
