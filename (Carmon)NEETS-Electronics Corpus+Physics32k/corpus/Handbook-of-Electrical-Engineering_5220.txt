Around the turn of the century, the ﬁrst fossil power plants used steam engines as the prime mover. These
plants were evolved to an 8- to 10-MW capacity, but increasing power demands resulted in the replacement
by a more efﬁcient steam boiler–turbine arrangement. The ﬁrst commercial steam turbine was introduced by
DeLaval  in  1882.  The  boilers  were  developed  from  heating  furnaces.  Oil  was  the  preferred  and  most  widely
used fuel in the beginning. The oil shortage promoted coal-ﬁred plants, but the adverse environmental effects
(sulfur dioxide generation, acid rain, dust pollution, etc.) curtailed their use in the late seventies. Presently the
most acceptable fuel is natural gas, which minimizes pollution and is available in large quantities. During the
next two decades, gas-ﬁred power plants will dominate the electric industry.
