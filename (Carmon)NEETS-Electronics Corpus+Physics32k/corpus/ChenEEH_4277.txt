CDMA reduces the average transmitted power, and increases
the battery efﬁciency. It allows a reuse factor of 1 (i.e., the same
frequency is used in adjacent cells), thus avoiding the need for
frequency planning. On the other hand, code planning is re-
quired, but this is less difﬁcult than frequency planning, as the
code reuse pattern is much larger than the frequency reuse
pattern commonly encountered in FDMA systems.
