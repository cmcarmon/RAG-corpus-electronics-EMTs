The formulation for Newtonian fluids stems from an observation made by Newton that, for most fluids,




τ
∝



∂
u


∂
y





{\displaystyle \tau \propto {\frac {\partial u}{\partial y}}}

In order to apply this to the Navier–Stokes equations, three assumptions were made by Stokes:

The stress tensor is a linear function of the strain rate tensor or equivalently the velocity gradient.
The fluid is isotropic.
For a fluid at rest,



∇
⋅

τ



{\displaystyle \nabla \cdot {\boldsymbol {\tau }}}
must be zero (so that hydrostatic pressure results).

The above list states the classic argument that the shear strain rate tensor (i.e. the (symmetric) shear part of the velocity gradient) is a pure shear tensor and does not include any inflow/outflow part (i.e. any compression/expansion part). This means that its trace is zero, and this is achieved by subtracting



∇

⋅


u



{\displaystyle \nabla \!\cdot \!\mathbf {u} }
in a symmetric way from the diagonal elements of the tensor. The compressional contribution to viscous stress is added as a separate diagonal tensor.
Applying these assumptions will lead to:

That is, the deviatoric of the deformation rate tensor is identified to the deviatoric of the stress tensor, up to a factor μ.





δ

i
j




{\displaystyle \delta _{ij}}
is the Kronecker delta. μ and λ are proportionality constants associated with the assumption that stress depends on strain linearly; μ is called the first coefficient of viscosity or shear viscosity (usually just called "viscosity") and λ is the second coefficient of viscosity or volume viscosity (and it is related to bulk viscosity). The value of λ, which produces a viscous effect associated with volume change, is very difficult to determine, not even its sign is known with absolute certainty. Even in compressible flows, the term involving λ is often negligible; however it can occasionally be important even in nearly incompressible flows and is a matter of controversy. When taken nonzero, the most common approximation is λ ≈ - ⅔ μ.
A straightforward substitution of




τ

i
j




{\displaystyle \tau _{ij}}
into the momentum conservation equation will yield the Navier–Stokes equations, describing a compressible Newtonian fluid:

where the transpose has been used. The body force has been decomposed into density and external acceleration, i.e.

In addition to this equation, an equation of state and an equation for the conservation of energy is needed. The equation of state to use depends on context (often the ideal gas law), the conservation of energy will read:

With a good equation of state and good functions for the dependence of parameters (such as viscosity) on the variables, this system of equations seems to properly model the dynamics of all known gases and most liquids.
