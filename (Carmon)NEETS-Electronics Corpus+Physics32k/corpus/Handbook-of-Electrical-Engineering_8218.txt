Figure 83.23 indicates the companies who are making a serious effort at developing the three dominant full
color  structures.  The  basic  concepts  of  the  two  ac  structures  are  shown  in  Fig. 83.30.  The  double  substrate
structure is very similar to the monochrome ac structure shown in Fig. 83.28. The single substrate structure
separates  the  discharge  cathode  areas  from  the  phosphor  by  applying  the  sustain  voltage  only  to  the  lower
electrodes  while  the  phosphor  is  on  the  top.  The  single  substrate  approach  promises  longer  phosphor  life
because it is not directly sputtered by the energetic ions that are directed toward the cathodes.
