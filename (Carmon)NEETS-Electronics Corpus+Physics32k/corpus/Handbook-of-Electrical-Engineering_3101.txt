Similarly,  high-pass,  bandpass,  and  notch  ﬁlters  can  be  designed  by  rearranging  the  resistor,  capacitor,  and
inductor  in  Fig.  29.30(a)  to  get  the  desired  transfer  function  and  then  simulating  the  inductor.  When  the
inductor  is  grounded,  it  can  be  simulated  using  the  op  amp–simulated  inductor,  but  when  the  inductor  is
ﬂoating, the current conveyor–simulated inductor must be used.
