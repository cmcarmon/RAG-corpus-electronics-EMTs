IDEF4 method is a graphically oriented methodology for the design of object-oriented software systems. The object-oriented programming paradigm provides the developer with an abstract view of his program as composed of a set of state maintaining objects which define the behavior of the program by the protocol of their interactions. An object consists of a set of local state defining attributes and a set of methods (procedures) that define the behavior of that particular object and its relationship to the other objects that make up the system.
The IDEF4 method multi-dimensional approach to object-oriented software system design consists of the following items:
Design layers (system-level, application-level, and low-level design),
Artifact design status (application domain, in transition, software domain),
Design models (static, dynamic, and behavior) and the design rationale component, and
Design features ranging from general to specific enabling deferred decision making.
