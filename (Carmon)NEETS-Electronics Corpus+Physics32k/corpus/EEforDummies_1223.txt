So, to make the 555 timer sound the alarm only when light is present, you 
need to create a light‐sensitive switch and use it to control the reset pin on 
the 555 timer. The left side of the circuit in Figure 17-4 provides the light‐ 
sensitive switch in the form of a photoresistor‐transistor combination.
