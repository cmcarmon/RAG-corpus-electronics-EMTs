Finally, it should be noted that overhead is imposed for
linear-to-logarithmic and logarithmic-to-linear conversion.
Conversion overhead contributes additional area and time
complexity as well as power dissipation. As the number of
operations grows, however, the conversion overhead remains
constant; therefore, the overheadâ€™s contribution to the overall
budget becomes negligible.
