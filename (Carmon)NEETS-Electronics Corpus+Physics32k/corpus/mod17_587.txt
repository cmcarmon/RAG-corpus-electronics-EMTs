In recent years, the Navy has introduced several new highly technical and effective combat weapons 
systems. However, these weapons systems did not solve the basic combat command problems that 
confront our Navy. In combat, a fleet continues to be involved in close-range offense and defense. During 
close-range combat, the shipboard combat information center (CIC) is involved in complex tactical 
situations. These situations require intelligent and highly important decisions. Each decision has to be 
made in a short period of time. You will find the speed at which these combat situations must be solved is 
inconceivable to someone thinking in terms of typical CIC operations of the recent past. Therefore, the 
NTDS was developed by the U.S. Navy as a command tool for commanders in tactical combat situations.
