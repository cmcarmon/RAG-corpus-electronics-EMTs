T



{\displaystyle \mathbf {T} }
is the torque exerted by the fluid on the sphere





Ω



{\displaystyle \mathbf {\Omega } }
is the angular velocity of the sphere






Ω


∞




{\displaystyle \mathbf {\Omega } ^{\infty }}
is the angular velocity of the background flow, evaluated at the sphere centre (set to zero in some references).
