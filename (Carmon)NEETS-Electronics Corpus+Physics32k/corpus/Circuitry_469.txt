Logic  gates  are  circuits  designed  to  produce  the 
basic logic functions, AND, OR, etc. These circuits 
are designed to be interconnected into larger, more 
complex,  logic  circuit  arrangements.  Since  these 
circuits form the basic building blocks of all digital 
systems, we have summarized the action of each of 
the gates in the next section. For each gate we have 
included its British Standard (BS) symbol together 
with  its  American  Standard  (MIL/ANSI)  symbol. 
We have also included the truth tables and Boolean 
expressions (using  ‘+’ to denote OR, ‘·’ to denote 
AND,  and  ‘E’ to  denote  NOT).  Note  that,  while 
inverters  and  buffers  each  have  only  one  input, 
exclusive-OR  gates  have  two  inputs  and  the  other 
basic  gates  (AND,  OR,  NAND  and  NOR)  are 
commonly available with up to eight inputs.
