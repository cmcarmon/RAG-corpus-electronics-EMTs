MATLAB using adj (A).
Matrices with nonzero determinants are said to be non-
singular or of full rank. For nonsquare matrices A 2 F mn,
the rank is the number of linearly independent columns of A
over the Ô¨Åeld F and is  min(m, n). Related commands in
MATLAB are rank and null. Simultaneous linear equations
