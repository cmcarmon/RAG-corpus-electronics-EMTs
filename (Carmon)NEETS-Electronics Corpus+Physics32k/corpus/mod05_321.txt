As you know from Lenzâ€™s law, any induced emf tries to oppose the changing field that induces it. In
the case of an induction motor, the changing field is the motion of the resultant stator field. A force is
exerted on the rotor by the induced emf and the resultant magnetic field. This force tends to cancel the
relative motion between the rotor and the stator field. The rotor, as a result, moves in the same direction
as the rotating stator field.
