It is not necessary that the voltage supplies be equal to create a point of virtual ground. In view (B)
V1 supplies +1 volt to the circuit while V2 supplies -10 volts. The total difference in potential is 11 volts.
The total resistance of this circuit (R1 + R2) is 11 ohms. The total current (IT) is 1 ampere. The voltage
drop across R1 (ER1  = R1 ·  IT) is 1 volt. The voltage drop across R2 (ER2  = R2 ·  I T) is 10 volts. The
voltage at point A can be computed:
