In a previous discussion, lumped and distributed constants were explained. Figure 3-15, view A,
shows the properties of resistance, inductance, capacitance, and conductance combined in a short section
of two-wire transmission line. The illustration shows the evenly distributed capacitance as a single
lumped capacitor and the distributed conductance as a lumped leakage path. Lumped values may be used
for transmission line calculations if the physical length of the line is very short compared to the
wavelength of energy being transmitted. Figure 3-15, view B, shows all four properties lumped together
and represented by their conventional symbols.
