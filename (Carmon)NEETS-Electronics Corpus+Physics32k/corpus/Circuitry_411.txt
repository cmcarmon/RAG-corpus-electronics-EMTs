Example 8.4 
 
A wideband operational amplifier has a slew rate of 
15 V/µs. If the amplifier is used in a circuit with a 
voltage gain of 20 and a perfect step input of 100 
mV is applied to its input, determine the time taken 
for the output to change level. 
 
Solution 
 
The output voltage change will be 20 × 100 = 2,000 
mV  (or  2  V).  Re-arranging  the  formula  for  slew 
rate gives: 
V
