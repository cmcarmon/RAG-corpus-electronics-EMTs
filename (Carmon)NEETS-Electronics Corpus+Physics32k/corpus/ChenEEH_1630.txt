The applications of multimedia compression are limitless.
The International Standards Organization ISO has provided
standards that are appropriate for a wide range of possible
compression products. The video encoding standards by ISO,
developed by Motion Pictures Expert Group (MPEG), em-
brace video pictures from the tiny screen of a videophone to
the high-deﬁnition images needed for electronic cinema.
Audio coding stretches from speech-grade monochannel to
multichannel surround sound. Data compression techniques
are classiﬁed as lossless and lossy coding. In lossless coding,
the data from the decoder is identical bit-for-bit with the
original source data. Lossless coding generally provides limited
compression ratios. Higher compression is possible only with
lossy coding in which data from the decoder is not identical to
the original source data and between them minor differences
exist. Lossy coding is not suitable for most applications using
text data but is used extensively for multimedia data compres-
sion as it allows much greater compression ratios. Successful
lossy codes are those in which the errors are imperceptible to a
human viewer or listener. Thus, lossy codes must be based
on an understanding of psychoacoustic and psychovisual
