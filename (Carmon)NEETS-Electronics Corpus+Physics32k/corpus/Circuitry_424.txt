Comparators 
 
A comparator  using  an  operational  amplifier  is 
shown in Fig. 8.17. Since no negative feedback has 
been applied, this circuit uses the maximum gain of 
the  operational  amplifier.  The  output  voltage 
produced by the operational amplifier will thus rise 
to  the  maximum  possible  value  (equal  to  the 
positive  supply  rail  voltage)  whenever  the  voltage 
present  at  the  non-inverting  input  exceeds  that 
present  at  the  inverting  input.  Conversely,  the 
output  voltage  produced  by 
the  operational 
amplifier  will  fall  to  the  minimum  possible  value 
(equal to the negative supply rail voltage) whenever 
the  voltage  present  at  the  inverting  input  exceeds 
that present at the non-inverting input.
