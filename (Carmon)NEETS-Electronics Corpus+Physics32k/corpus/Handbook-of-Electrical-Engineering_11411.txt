One text that has been regularly updated since the Ô¨Årst volume appeared in 1980 is Diagnostic Sonography:
Principles and Instruments, 4th edition, by F.W. Kremkau (W.B. Saunders, Philadelphia, 1993). Though this text
is designed primarily to train sonographers who do not have a technical background, it provides the funda-
mentals of ultrasound imaging in a format that is very easy to read and understand.
