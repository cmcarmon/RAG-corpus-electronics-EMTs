Further Information
There is an abundance of books and literature on small electrical motors. IEEE Transactions on Industry Appli-
cations, Power Electronics, Power Delivery and Industrial Electronics all have articles on the subject. In addition,
IEE and other publications and conference records can provide the reader with speciﬁc and useful information.
Electrical Machines and Drives [Slemon, 1992] is one of the many excellent textbooks on the subject. Stepping
Motors  and  their  Microprocessor  Controls  [Kenjo,  1984]  has  a  thorough  discussion  of  stepping  motors,  while
Fractional  and  Subfractional  Horsepower  Electric  Motors  [Veinott  and  Martin,  1986]  covers  small  AC  and  DC
motors. Brushless Permanent-Magnet and Reluctance Motor Drives [Miller, 1989] and Permanent Magnet, Reluctance
and  Self-Synchronous  Motors  [Nasar  et  al.,  1993]  reﬂect  the  increased  interest  in  reluctance  and  brushless  DC
motors, and provide information on their theory of operation, design and control. Finally, Fractional Horsepower
Electric Motors [Miller and Miller, 1984] gives a lot of practical information about the application of small motors.
