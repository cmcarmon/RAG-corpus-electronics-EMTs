The applied electric ﬁeld to perceive the electrorheological phenomenon is usually in the order of 4 kV/mm.
When the electric ﬁeld is applied, the positive and negative charges on the suspended particles are separated,
forming a dipole of charges. These dipoles then align (polarize) themselves by mutual forces of attraction and
repulsion to other similar dipoles, resulting in unique ﬂow characteristics. In the absence of an electric ﬁeld,
there is no dipole separation of charges, and hence the ﬂuid returns to its normal ﬂow.
