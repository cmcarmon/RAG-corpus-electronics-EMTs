An overview of number of ratifications of the conferences is shown below. Although the number of ratifications was larger for the revised conventions, the entry into force criteria were met in none of them. The conventions were closed for signature upon the entry into force of the Seafarers' Hours of Work and the Manning of Ships Convention, 1996.
An overview of the ratifications of the conventions as of 27 May 2013 is shown below. Only the 1958 received ratifications from the list of countries of which 9 were required to ratify. Six such ratifications were received (Yugoslavia also ratified, but is depicted in the list as its successor states). Denouncements of the convention were a result of the entry into force of the Seafarers' Hours of Work and the Manning of Ships Convention, 1996 for those countries. Also ratification of the Maritime Labour Convention results -after it enters into force on 20 August 2013- in denouncement of the conventions.
