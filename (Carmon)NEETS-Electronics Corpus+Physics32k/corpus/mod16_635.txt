The variable control adds attenuation to the step that is selected. Since accurately calibrating a
potentiometer is difficult, the variable control is either left unmarked or the front panel is marked off in
some convenient units, such as 1-10 and 1-100. The attenuator control, however, can be accurately
calibrated. To do this, you turn off the variable control to remove it from the attenuator circuit. This
position is usually marked CAL (calibrate) on the panel, or an associated light indicates if the VAR
control is on or off. In figure 6-19, the light called UNCAL indicates the VAR control is in the
uncalibrated position.
