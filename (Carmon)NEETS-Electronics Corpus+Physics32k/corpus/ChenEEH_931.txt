The quadratic programming problem QP-2 is solved by
applying the classical method of Lagrange multipliers for
constrained optimization (Fletcher, 1987; BjoÂ¨rck, 1996; Law-
son and Hanson, 1974). To start, note that minimizing the
objective function e in equation 4.51 is equivalent to minimiz-
ing the function:
