A right hand spiral bevel gear is one in which the outer half of a tooth is inclined in the clockwise direction from the axial plane through the midpoint of the tooth as viewed by an observer looking at the face of the gear.
A left hand spiral bevel gear is one in which the outer half of a tooth is inclined in the counterclockwise direction from the axial plane through the midpoint of the tooth as viewed by an observer looking at the face of the gear.
Note that a spiral bevel gear and pinion are always of opposite hand, including the case when the gear is internal.
Also note that the designations right hand and left hand are applied similarly to other types of bevel gear, hypoid gears, and oblique tooth face gears.
