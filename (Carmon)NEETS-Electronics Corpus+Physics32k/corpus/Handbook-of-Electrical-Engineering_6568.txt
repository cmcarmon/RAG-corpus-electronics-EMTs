System Considerations
Long-distance ﬁber links carry voice, video, and data information. Messages not already in digital form are ﬁrst
converted to it. A single voice channel is normally transmitted at a rate of 64,000 bits per second. Video requires
a much higher rate. The rate could be as much as 90 Mbps or so, but video compression techniques can lower
this  rate  signiﬁcantly.  Fiber  systems  for  the  telephone  network  operate  at  such  high  rates  that  many  voice
channels  can  be  time-division  multiplexed  (TDM)  onto  the  same  ﬁber  for  simultaneous  transmission.  For
example, a ﬁber operating at a rate of 2.3 Gbps could carry more than 30,000 digitized voice channels.
