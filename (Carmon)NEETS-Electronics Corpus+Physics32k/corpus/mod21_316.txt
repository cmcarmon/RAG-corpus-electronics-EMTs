The Wheatstone bridge, shown in figure 3-1, is often used to measure resistance. These instruments 
are usually portable because they require only a small, dc source to power the bridge, which is easily 
obtained from flashlight batteries. In those cases where an external supply voltage is desirable for the 
operation of the bridge, use the minimum voltage that will give a reliable indication by the galvanometer. 
Increasing the supply voltage any further results in uncompensated thermal variations and decreased 
bridge accuracy. If greater bridge sensitivity is needed, use a galvanometer with greater sensitivity.
