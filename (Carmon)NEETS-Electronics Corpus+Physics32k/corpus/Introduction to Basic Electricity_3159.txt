 working  junction  transistor.  A  transistor  is  a 
 three-element, two-junction device used to  control 
electron flow. By varying the amount of voltage 
 applied to the three  elements, the amount of  current 
can be controlled for purposes of amplification, 
 oscillation, and switching. These applications are 
covered in Chapters 38, 39, and 40.
