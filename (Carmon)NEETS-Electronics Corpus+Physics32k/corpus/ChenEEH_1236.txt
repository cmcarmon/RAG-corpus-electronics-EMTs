Kastner and Sarrafzadeh (2001) developed methods to
reduce interconnect delay and noise caused by coupling. The
coupling-free routing (CFR) takes a set of nets and tries to ﬁnd
a one-bend coupling-free routing for a subset of nets. A routed
net must not be coupled with any other routed net. These
authors deﬁned coupling as a Boolean variable, which is
appropriate when the coupling is greater than some threshold.
They developed an exact algorithm for the CFR decision prob-
lem via a transformation to 2-satisﬁability (2SAT). This algo-
rithm runs in linear time. Kastner and Sarrafzadeh (2001) also
presented the implication graph that models the dependencies
associated with CFR. Moreover, they developed an algorithm
for the maximum coupling-free layout (MAX–CFL) problem.
Given a set of nets, the MAX–CFL is deﬁned as ﬁnding a subset
of nets that are coupling-free routable. The subset should have
maximum size and/or criticality. This algorithm is the impli-
cation algorithm. In addition, Kastner and Sarrafzadeh (2001)
presented the coupling capacitance between two wires i and j
as follows:
