Speciﬁcs  of  various  microprocessor  and  microsystem  chips  are  found  in  the  respective  manufacturer’s
reference  literature;  for  any  design  one  must  become  familiar  with  the  applicable  manual  and  design  notes.
Even for a modest chip the reference manual may run 300 pages; in addition, the manufacturer’s free-of-charge
support software is of comparable size. For example the Motorola 68HC11 reference manual is 512 pages, and
there is over 1 megabyte of design support software available from the manufacturer. The Intel i860 data book
is  150  pages,  hardware  and  programmer  reference  manuals  are  over  300  pages,  and  the  support  software  is
several megabytes.
