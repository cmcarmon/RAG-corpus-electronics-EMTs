In general, waves are also affected by gravity and are then called gravity–capillary waves. Their dispersion relation reads, for waves on the interface between two fluids of infinite depth:

{\displaystyle \omega ^{2}=|k|\left({\frac {\rho -\rho '}{\rho +\rho '}}g+{\frac {\sigma }{\rho +\rho '}}k^{2}\right),}

where g is the acceleration due to gravity, ρ and ρ‘ are the mass density of the two fluids (ρ > ρ‘). Notice the factor
