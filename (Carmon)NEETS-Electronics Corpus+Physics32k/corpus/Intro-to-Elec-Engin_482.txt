The primary advantage of digital technology is the low cost, simplicity, and versatility of the
digital building blocks. Because digital signals have a Ô¨Ånite number of discrete amplitudes at any
given time, distinctive digital building blocks are developed to process them. Digital systems are
built by repeating a very few simple blocks. The approach becomes very powerful because the
blocks (mass-produced in enormous numbers) are inexpensive in IC form and can be repeated
thousands of times.
