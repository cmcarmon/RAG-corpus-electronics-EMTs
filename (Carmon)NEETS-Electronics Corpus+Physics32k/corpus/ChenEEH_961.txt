Note that since isolated edges do not belong to a cycle, the
clock skews on these edges are linearly independent of any
other clock skews in the circuit. Intuitively, the clock skew of
an isolated edge can be assigned to be any value without
contradicting the linear dependencies among the skews in a
circuit. Observe, for example, equation 4.31 written for the
modiÔ¨Åed circuit C1 shown in Figure 4.12:
