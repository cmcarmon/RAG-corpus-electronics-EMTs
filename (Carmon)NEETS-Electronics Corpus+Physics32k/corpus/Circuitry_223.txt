Problems 
 
4.1   A sine wave has a frequency of 250 Hz and 
an amplitude of 50 V. Determine its periodic
 
 
time and r.m.s. value. 
4.2   A  sinusoidal  voltage  has  an  r.m.s.  value  of
240 V and a period of 16.7 ms. What is the
 
 
frequency and peak value of the voltage? 
4.3   Determine  the  frequency  and  peak-peak
values  of  each  of  the  waveforms  shown  in
 
 
Fig. 4.29. 
4.4   A sine wave has a frequency of 100 Hz and 
 
the 
in  amplitude  of  20  V.  Determine 
instantaneous value of voltage (a) 2 ms and 
 
 
(b) 9 ms from the start of a cycle.
