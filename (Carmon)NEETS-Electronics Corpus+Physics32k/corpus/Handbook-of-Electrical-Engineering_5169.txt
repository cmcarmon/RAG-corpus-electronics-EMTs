Electromagnetic Smart Materials
In  recent  times  a  number  of  materials  that  possess  ferroelectric  properties  have  been  discovered,  the  most
popular of which is barium titanate (BaTiO3). Barium titanate has an excellent prospect as a smart material
because of the several advantages it offers, such as high mechanical strength, resistance to heat and moisture,
and  ease  of  manufacturing.  BaTiO3  and  other  similar  materials  are  frequently  referred  to  as  ferroelectric
ceramics. Also, electrets such as polymethylmethacrylate offer promise for smart applications.
