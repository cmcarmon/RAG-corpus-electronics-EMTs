Sea ice thickness increases over time, and increases when winds and currents push the ice together. The European Space Agency's Cryosat-2 satellite was launched in April 2010 on a quest to map the thickness and shape of the Earth's polar ice cover. Its single instrument - a SAR/Interferometric Radar Altimeter is able to measure the sea ice freeboard.
