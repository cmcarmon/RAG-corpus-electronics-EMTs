illustrate  your  results  and  comment  on  your 
findings. 
 
Assignment  13    Small-signal  amplifier  design  and 
construction 
 
Design,  construct  and  test  a  single-stage  transistor 
amplifier. Write a report describing the model used 
for the small-signal amplifier and include a detailed 
comparison  of 
characteristics 
compared  with  the  measured  performance  of  the 
stage. 
 
Assignment 14  Electronic counter investigation 
 
Prepare a report describing the characteristics of J-
K bistable  elements  when  compared  with  D-type 
and R-S bistables. Using the data obtained, design, 
construct  and  test  a  four-stage  binary  counter. 
Modify  the  design  using  a  standard  logic  gate  to 
produce  a  decade  counter.  Include  in  your  report 
timing  diagrams  for  both  the  binary  and  decade 
counters. 
 
Assignment 15  Pulse generator investigation 
 
Prepare  a  report  describing  one  oscillator  circuit, 
one bistable circuit and one monostable circuit. The 
report should include a description of one industrial 
application  for  each  of  the  circuits  together  with 
sample calculations of frequency and pulse rate for 
the two oscillator circuits, and pulse  width  for the 
monostable circuit. 
 
Assignment 16  Performance testing 
 
Carry  out  performance  tests  on  two  different 
amplifier  circuits,  two  waveform  generators  and 
the  measured 
two  digital  circuits.  Compare 
performance 
the 
manufacturer’s  specification  and  present  your 
findings  in  a  written  report.  The  report  should 
include  details  of  the  calibration  and  operation  of 
each 
the 
manufacturer’s  handbooks  as  well  as  evidence  of 
the adoption of safe working practice. 
 
Assignment 17  Microprocessor clock 
 
Design, construct and test (using an oscilloscope) a 
microprocessor  clock  based  on 
two  Schmitt 
inverting logic gates and a quartz crystal. The clock
