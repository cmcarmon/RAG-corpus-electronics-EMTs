In this section, several classes of passive components are brieï¬‚y
described that are related to special materials and special
techniques for designing and realizing certain classes of passive
microwave components (as described in previous sections).
Without getting into details, these components include acous-
tic microwave devices, microwave ferroelectric devices,
micromachined components, and superconducting compo-
nents. No doubt, new and innovative passive components
are emerging, owing to the advancement of new materials
(e.g., low-loss RF ferroelectrics), new processing techniques
