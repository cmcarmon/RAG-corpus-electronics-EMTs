where  rh(t) = *‘
–‘ h(t  +  u)h(u)du.  However,  rh(t)  has  Fourier  transform  H( f )H*( f )  =  *H( f )*2,  because  the
Fourier  transform  of  the  convolution  of  two  functions  is  the  product  of  their  Fourier  transforms,  and  the
Fourier transform of h(–t) is the complex conjugate  H*( f ) of the Fourier transform H( f ) of h(t). Thus, the
Fourier transform of RYY(t), denoted by  F{RYY(t)}, is
