The product device in the receiverâ€™s demodulator acts like a synchronous detector that
removes the input carrier. The major disadvantage of the coherent ASK is that the required local
carrier must be phase-connected with the input signal. The input to the integrator is a unipolar
PCM signal, and the remainder of Figure 15.3.14 is a PCM receiver [see Figure 15.3.8(a)].
