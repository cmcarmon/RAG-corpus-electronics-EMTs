The Nagelâ€“Schreckenberg model is a theoretical model for the simulation of freeway traffic. The model was developed in the early 1990s by the German physicists Kai Nagel and Michael Schreckenberg. It is essentially a simple cellular automaton model for road traffic flow that can reproduce traffic jams, i.e., show a slow down in average car speed when the road is crowded (high density of cars). The model shows how traffic jams can be thought of as an emergent or collective phenomenon due to interactions between cars on the road, when the density of cars is high and so cars are close to each other on average.
