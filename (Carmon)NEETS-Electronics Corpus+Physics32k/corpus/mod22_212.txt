The raster is a series of horizontal lines crossing the face of the crt screen (fig. 2-28). Each horizontal 
line is made up of one trace of the electron beam from left to right. The raster starts at the top left corner 
of the crt screen. As each horizontal line is completed, the blanked electron beam is rapidly returned or 
retraced to the left of the screen.
