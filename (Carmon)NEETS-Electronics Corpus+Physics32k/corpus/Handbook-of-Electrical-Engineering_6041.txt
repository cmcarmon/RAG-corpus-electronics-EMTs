SCADA, with its relatively expensive RTUs installed at distribution substations, can provide status and mea-
surements for distribution feeders at the substation. Distribution automation equipment is now available to
measure and control at locations dispersed along distribution circuits. This equipment can monitor sectional-
izing devices (switches, interruptors, fuses), operate switches for circuit reconﬁguration, control voltage, read
customers’ meters, implement time-dependent pricing (on-peak, off-peak rates), and switch customer equip-
ment to manage load. This equipment requires signiﬁcantly increased functionality at distribution control centers.
Distribution control center functionality varies widely from company to company, and the following list is
