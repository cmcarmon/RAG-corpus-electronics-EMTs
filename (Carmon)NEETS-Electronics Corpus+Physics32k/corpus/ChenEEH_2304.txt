A distortionless line is truly non-dispersive, exhibits a real
characteristic impedance Z0, and satisﬁes
the condition
RC ¼ LG. Thus, despite being dissipative, it possesses two of
the three desirable characteristics of the lossless line. In this
case, the propagation parameters are exactly given by:
