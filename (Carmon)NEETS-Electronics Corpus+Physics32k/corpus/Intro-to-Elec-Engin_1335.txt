Any interference at frequencies outside the signal band can be eliminated by appropriate
ﬁltering. However, in order to combat interference within the signal band (after proper shielding
and grounding), a notch ﬁlter is sometimes used to avoid the bothersome interference at a single
frequency f 0. Figure 14.3.2 illustrates the point: Part (a) shows the composite amplitude spectrum
including the single-frequency interference; part (b) depicts the amplitude ratio of the notch ﬁlter.
The notch-ﬁltering technique does, of course, introduce some inevitable signal distortion, and
such ﬁltering should precede ampliﬁcation to prevent possible saturation of the ampliﬁer due to
the interference.
