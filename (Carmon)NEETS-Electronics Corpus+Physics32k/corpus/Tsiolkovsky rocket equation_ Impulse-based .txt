The equation can also be derived from the basic integral of acceleration in the form of force (thrust) over mass. By representing the delta-v equation as the following:

Δ

d
t


{\displaystyle \Delta v=\int _{t0}^{t1}{\frac {|T|}{{m_{0}}-{t}\Delta {m}}}~dt}

where T is thrust,




m

0




{\displaystyle m_{0}}
is the initial (wet) mass and



Δ
m


{\displaystyle \Delta m}
is the initial mass minus the final (dry) mass,
and realising that the integral of a resultant force over time is total impulse, assuming thrust is the only force involved,

{\displaystyle \int _{t0}^{t1}F~dt=J}
