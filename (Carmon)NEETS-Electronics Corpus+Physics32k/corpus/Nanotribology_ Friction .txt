Friction, the force opposing to the relative motion, is usually idealized by means of some empirical laws such as Amonton’s First and Second laws and Coulomb’s law. At the nanoscale, however, such laws may lose their validity. For instance, Amonton’s second law states that friction coefficient is independent from the area of contact. Surfaces, in general, have asperities, that reduce the real area of contact and therefore, minimizing such area can minimize friction.
During the scanning process with an AFM or FFM, the tip, sliding on the sample’s surface, passes through both low (stable) and high potential energy points, determined, for instance, by atomic positions or, on a larger scale, by surface roughness. Without considering thermal effects, the only force that makes the tip overcome these potential barriers is the spring force given by the support: this causes the stick-slip motion.
At the nanoscale, friction coefficient depends on several conditions. For example, with light loading conditions, tend to be lower than those at the macroscale. With higher loading conditions, such coefficient tends to be similar to the macroscopic one. Temperature and relative motion speed can also affect friction.
