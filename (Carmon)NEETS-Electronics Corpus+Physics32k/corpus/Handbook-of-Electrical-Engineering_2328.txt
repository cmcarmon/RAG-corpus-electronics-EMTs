High-Frequency Large-Signal Equivalent Circuit Model of a BJT.
 In this context, high-frequency denotes
frequencies above 10 kHz. In the equivalent circuit model, the transistor is assumed to be composed of two
back-to-back diodes. Two current-dependent current sources are added to model the current ﬂowing through
the reverse-biased base-collector junction and the forward-biased base-emitter junction. Two junction capac-
itances, CjE and CjC, model the ﬁxed charges in the emitter-base space charge region and base-collector space
charge region, respectively. Two diffusion capacitances, CDE and CDC, model the corresponding charge associated
with mobile carriers, while the base resistance, rb, represents the voltage drop in the base region. All the above
circuit elements are very strong functions of operating frequency, signal strength, and bias voltage.
