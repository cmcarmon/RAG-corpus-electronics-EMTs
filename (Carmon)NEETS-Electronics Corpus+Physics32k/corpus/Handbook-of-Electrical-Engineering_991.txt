Step 6 is just like step 5, except we are Ô¨Åtting the short-channel device. Some people think that the value of
XJ should be the true junction depth. This is not true. The parameter XJ is loosely related to the junction depth,
but XJ is really the short-channel correction to NSUB. Do not be surprised if XJ is not equal to the true junction
depth.
