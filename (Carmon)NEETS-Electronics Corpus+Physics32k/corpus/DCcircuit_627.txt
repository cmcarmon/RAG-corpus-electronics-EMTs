Once again, when building battery/resistor circuits, the student or hobbyist is faced with sev-
eral different modes of construction. Perhaps the most popular is the solderless breadboard: a
platform for constructing temporary circuits by plugging components and wires into a grid of
interconnected points. A breadboard appears to be nothing but a plastic frame with hundreds
of small holes in it. Underneath each hole, though, is a spring clip which connects to other
spring clips beneath other holes. The connection pattern between holes is simple and uniform:
