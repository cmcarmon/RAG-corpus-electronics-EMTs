When a positive current is applied to terminal G, transistor Q2 is biased into conduction, causing its 
collector current to rise. Since the current gain of Q2 increases with increased collector current, a point 
(called the breakover point) is reached where the loop gain equals unity and the circuit becomes 
regenerative. At this point, collector current of the two transistors rapidly increases to a value limited only 
by the external circuit. Both transistors are driven into saturation, and the impedance between A and C is 
very low. The positive current applied to terminal G, which served to trigger the self-regenerative action, 
is no longer required since the collector of PNP transistor Q1 now supplies more than enough current to 
drive Q2. The circuit will remain on until it is turned off by a reduction in the collector current to a value 
below that necessary to maintain conduction.
