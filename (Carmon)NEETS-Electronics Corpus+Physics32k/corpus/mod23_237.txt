FM record electronics process signals to be recorded differently than direct record electronics.
Instead of recording the input signal just as it appears at the recorder’s input, FM record electronics use
the input signal to vary (modulate) the carrier frequency of a record oscillator. The frequency modulated
output signal of the record oscillator then becomes the signal that’s actually recorded onto the magnetic
media. Figure 5-4 shows a block diagram of the FM record electronics.
