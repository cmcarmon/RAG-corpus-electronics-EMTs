Direct current (DC) circuit analysis deals with constant currents and voltages, while al-
ternating current (AC) circuit analysis deals with time-varying voltage and current signals
whose time average values are zero. Circuits with time-average values of non-zero are also
important and will be mentioned brieﬂy in the section on ﬁlters. The DC circuit compo-
nents considered in this course are the constant voltage source, constant current source, and
resistor. Electronics also deals with charge Q, electric E and magnetic B ﬁelds, as well as,
potential V . We will not be concerned with a detailed description of these quantities but will
use approximation methods when dealing with them. Hence electronics can be considered
as a more practical approach to these subjects. For the details look at your classical physics
and quantum mechanics courses.
