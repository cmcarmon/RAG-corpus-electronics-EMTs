Space Charge Region
Contacting a p- and n-doped region leads to a large gradient
of the carrier densities at the junction. The result is a diffusion
current across the junction and an electric ﬁeld in the op-
posite direction, due to the ionized doping atoms
left
behind, which form the SCR. Therefore, in thermal equi-
librium (V ¼ 0), the corresponding drift current equals the
diffusion current, resulting in a zero net current through
the junction. The occurring electric ﬁeld leads to a built-in
voltage:
