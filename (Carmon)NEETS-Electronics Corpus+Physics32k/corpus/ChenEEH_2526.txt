enhancing the impedance transformation ratio. Usually, the
coupled-line schemes may provide an impedance ratio up to
10, depending on the geometry and the substrate used in
the design. For symmetrical structures, even- and odd-mode
parameters are widely used for the analysis and synthesis of
impedance transformers.
