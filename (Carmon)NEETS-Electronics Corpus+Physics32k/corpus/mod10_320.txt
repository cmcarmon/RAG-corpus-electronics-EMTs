Electromagnetic interference can be reduced or eliminated by using various suppression techniques. 
The amount of emi that is produced by a radio transmitter can be controlled by cutting transmitting 
antennas to the correct frequency, limiting bandwidth, and using electronic filtering networks and metallic 
shielding.
