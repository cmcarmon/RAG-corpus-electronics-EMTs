Note that because of our choice of variables, in the first quadrant current
is flowing into the positive terminal, that is, the battery is being charged, hence
the terminal voltage is actually larger than the nominal voltage. The fact that
the plot is almost a straight line validates our assumption that the battery can
be modeled as a voltage source in series with a linear resistor. Note further that
graphs such as Figure 1.43a can be characterized by only two numbers, a slope
and an intercept. The slope is 1/R where R is the series resistance in the model.
The intercept can be specified either in terms of a voltage or a current. If we
choose a voltage, then because the intercept is by definition at zero current, it
is called the open-circuit voltage. If the intercept is specified in terms of current,
it is called the short-circuit current, because by definition the voltage is zero at
that point. These terms reappear in Chapter 3 from a very different perspective:
Theveninâ€™s Theorem.
