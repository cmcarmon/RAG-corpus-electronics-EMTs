derstorm at the University of Florida’s International Center for Lightning Research and Testing

used  to  study  the  close  electromagnetic  environment  of  lightning  as  well  as  to  determine  lightning’s
effects on communication and power systems. (Photo courtesy of the University of Florida, Department
