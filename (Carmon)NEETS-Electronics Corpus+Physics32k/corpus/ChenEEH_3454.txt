In the past, the most common approach was to use metallic
wire to compare the sequence values. The sequence values are a
particular representation of the three-phase original values
obtained through a symmetrical component transformation
(Blackburn, 1993). Due to a number of practical problems
caused by the ground potential rise and limited length of
the physical wire experienced with the metallic wire use,
these schemes have been substituted by other approaches
where different media such as ﬁber-optic or microwave links are
used. Most recently, as the wideband communication channels
have become more affordable, the differential schemes are
being implemented using either dedicated ﬁber-optic cables
or a high-speed leased wideband communication system.
