The second theory of reverse breakdown effect in diodes is known as AVALANCHE breakdown and 
occurs at reverse voltages beyond 5 volts. This type of breakdown diode has a depletion region that is 
deliberately made narrower than the depletion region in the normal PN-junction diode, but thicker than 
that in the Zener-effect diode. The thicker depletion region is achieved by decreasing the doping level 
from the level used in Zener-effect diodes. The breakdown is at a higher voltage because of the higher
