Synthesis is a process in which we have a given function, and
we try to ﬁnd a network whose properties will be described by
that function. In most cases, we try to do so for a voltage
transfer function. The ﬁrst question that comes into mind is
whether any function can be realized as a network composed
of passive elements: capacitors, inductors, resistors, and trans-
formers. Rather obviously, the answer is no.
