Figure 9.3(A) illustrates snapshots of the Ez ﬁeld distribu-
tion versus radial distance from the source at the center of the
grid. Here, ﬁeld observations are made along cuts through the
grid passing through the source point and are either parallel to
the principal grid axes f ¼ 0 and 90 or parallel to the grid
diagonal f ¼ 45. (Note that, by the 908 rotational symmetry
of the Cartesian grid geometry, identical ﬁeld distributions are
obtained along f ¼ 0 and f ¼ 90.) The snapshots are taken
328Dt after the beginning of time-stepping. At this time, the
