Table 1-2 shows the figures associated with three meter movements available for use in multimeters.
The last two columns indicate the value of shunt resistance and the overall resistance of the shunt and
meter movement necessary to compensate all three movements to an ammeter sensitivity (full-scale
current) of 1 milliampere. Notice that as the voltmeter sensitivity increases, the resistance of the ammeter
decreases. This shows how a meter movement used in a voltmeter will have a high effective resistance
and the same meter movement used in an ammeter will have a low effective resistance because of the
shunt resistors.
