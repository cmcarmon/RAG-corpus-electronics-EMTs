 Even a perfectly straight length of conductor has some inductance. As you know, current in a 
conductor produces a magnetic field surrounding the conductor. When the current changes, the magnetic 
field changes. This causes relative motion between the magnetic field and the conductor, and an 
electromotive force (emf) is induced in the conductor. This emf is called a SELF-INDUCED EMF 
because it is induced in the conductor carrying the current. The emf produced by this moving magnetic 
field is also referred to as COUNTER ELECTROMOTIVE FORCE (cemf). The polarity of the counter 
electromotive force is in the opposite direction to the applied voltage of the conductor. The overall effect 
will be to oppose a change in current magnitude. This effect is summarized by Lenz's law which states 
that: THE INDUCED EMF IN ANY CIRCUIT IS ALWAYS IN A DIRECTION TO OPPOSE THE 
EFFECT THAT PRODUCED IT.
