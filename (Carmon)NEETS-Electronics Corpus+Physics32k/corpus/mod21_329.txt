A large value of resistance, R, is selected so that IC is virtually independent of the range of Z X to be 
measured. Thus, ICZ X represents the value of voltage measured by the vtvm. If R is chosen so that the 
voltage drop across ZX corresponds to a full-scale reading on the vtvm, a direct reading impedance meter 
is realized. For example, assume that the audio oscillator open-circuit voltage is 10 volts (rms) and that 
the full-scale reading of the vtvm is 0.05 volt. If you want to measure ZX values ranging up to a maximum 
of 5,000 ohms, you should use a 1-megohm resistor for R. This will result in a full-scale, 0.05-volt 
deflection. An oscillator that does not produce harmonics should be used.
