In  addition  to  rectangular  and  circular  waveguides,  several  other  waveguide  types  are  commonly  used  in
microwave applications. Among these are ridge waveguides and elliptical waveguides. The modes of elliptical
waveguides can be expressed in terms of Mathieu functions [Kretzschmar, 1970] and are similar to those of
circular waveguides but are less perturbed by minor twists and bends of the waveguide. This property makes
them attractive for coupling to antennas.
