This has the formal name compression set under constant force in air. In compression set A a force of 1.8 kN is applied to the specimen for a set time at a set temperature. Compression set A is defined as the percentage of original specimen thickness after the specimen has been left in normal conditions for 30 minutes. CA, the compression set A is given by CA = [(to - ti) / to] * 100 where to is the original specimen thickness and ti is the specimen thickness after testing.
