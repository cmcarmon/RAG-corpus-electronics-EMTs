When connecting cells in series, connect alternate terminals together (−−−− to +, −−−− 
to +, etc.) Always have two remaining terminals that are used for connection to the 
load only. Do not connect the two remaining terminals together as this is a short 
across the battery and would not only quickly discharge the cells but could cause 
some types of cells to explode.
