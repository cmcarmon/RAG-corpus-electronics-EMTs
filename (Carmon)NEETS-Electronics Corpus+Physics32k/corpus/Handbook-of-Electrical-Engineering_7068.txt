Deﬁnition: The rate distortion pair (R,D) is said to be achievable if there exists a rate distortion code of rate
R with expected distortion D. The rate distortion function R(D) is the inﬁmum of rates R such that (R,D) is
achievable for a given D.
Deﬁnition: The mutual information I(X, ˆX) between random variables X and ˆX, with joint probability mass
function p(x, ˆx) and marginal probability mass functions p(x) and p(ˆx ) is deﬁned as
