Once the different states are identiÔ¨Åed and a state-space diagram is developed, Markov analysis can proceed
systematically (probably with the help of a computer in the case of large systems) to yield a wealth of results
useful in system reliability evaluation. Inclusion of installation time after repair, maintenance, spare, standby
systems,  and  limitations  imposed  by  restricted  repair  facilities  are  some  of  the  many  problems  that  can  be
studied.
