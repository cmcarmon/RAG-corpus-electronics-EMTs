The engine order telegraph, steering telegraph, rudder-angle indicator, and similar position-
indicating systems used on naval ships are usually simple synchro systems. Some ships, however, use IC
synchros to transfer such information. These units operate on the same general principle as the synchros
we discussed in chapter 1.
