As time passed, larger ships that carried more sail were built. These ships, encouraging exploration
and commerce, helped to establish world trade routes. Soon strong navies were needed to guard these sea
lanes. Countries established their own navies to protect their citizens, commercial ships, and shipping
lanes against pirates and warring nations. With the addition of mounted armament, gunners joined the
shipâ€™s company of skilled or semiskilled technicians.
