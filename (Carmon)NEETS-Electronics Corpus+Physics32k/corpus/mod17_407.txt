The maximum number of intelligible transmissions taking place in the radio spectrum is being 
increased through the use of MULTIPLEXING. Multiplexing is the simultaneous transmission of a 
number of intelligible signals (messages) in either or both directions using only a single rf carrier. You 
may use two methods of multiplexing. These are TIME-DIVISION and FREQUENCY-DIVISION.
