Now let’s look at the number system that most computers use, the binary system. Just as the decimal
system, had the nines (R’s-1) and tens (R’s) complement, the binary system has two types of complement
methods. These two types are the ones (R’s-1) complement and the twos (R’s) complement. The binary
system R’s-1 complement is the difference between the binary number and all 1s. The R’s complement is
the difference between the binary number and the next higher power of 2.
