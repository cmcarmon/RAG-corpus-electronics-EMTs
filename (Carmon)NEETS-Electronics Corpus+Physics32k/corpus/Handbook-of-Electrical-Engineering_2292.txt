High Forward Current Effects
In the pn-junction diode analysis it was assumed that the density of injected carriers from the p region into
the n region is small compared to the density of majority carriers in that region. Thus, all of the forward voltage
VD  appears  across  the  junction.  Therefore,  the  injected  carriers  move  only  because  of  the  diffusion. At  high
forward  currents  this  is  not  the  case  anymore.  When  the  voltage  drop  across  the  bulk  resistance  becomes
comparable with the voltage across the junction, the effective applied voltage is reduced [Phillips, 1962]. Due
to the electric ﬁeld created by the voltage drop in the bulk (neutral) regions, the current is not only a diffusion
current anymore. The drift current due to the voltage drop across the bulk region opposes the diffusion current.
The net effect is that, ﬁrst, the current becomes proportional to twice the diffusion constant, second, the high-
level  current  becomes  independent  of  resistivity,  and,  third,  the  magnitude  of  the  exponent  is  reduced  by  a
factor of two in Eq. (22.37). The effect of high forward current on the I-V characteristic is shown in Fig. 22.15.
