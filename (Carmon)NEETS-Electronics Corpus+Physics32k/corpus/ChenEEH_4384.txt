where G(s) 2 R(s)pm is a proper rational transfer function
matrix consisting of p  m SISO transfer function entries. The
transfer function matrix can also be written in terms of an
equivalent PMD. Because a transfer function matrix as in the
SISO case represents only the controllable and observable
dynamics of a system, consider the following controllable
and observable PMD:
