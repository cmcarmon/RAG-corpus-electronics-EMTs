The Agena target vehicle was used for testing Earth orbit rendezvous in the NASA Gemini Program. Gemini 6 and Gemini 7 rendezvoused in orbit in 1965, but without Agena. Next, Gemini 8 successfully docked March 16, 1966 with the Agena. The Agena-Gemini rendezvous also achieved many other tasks in later Gemini launches.
