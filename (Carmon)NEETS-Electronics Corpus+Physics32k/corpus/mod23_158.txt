Figure 3-2 shows the construction of a typical multitrack magnetic head. Magnetic cores are wound 
with very thin wire, cemented together, and placed inside a half-bracket. A tip piece is then placed on top 
of the ferrite core, and the two half-brackets are assembled together. It's during this final assembly 
process that the headgap and the resulting frequency response of the magnetic head are determined. After 
some final contouring to give the magnetic head its curved face, it's ready for use.
