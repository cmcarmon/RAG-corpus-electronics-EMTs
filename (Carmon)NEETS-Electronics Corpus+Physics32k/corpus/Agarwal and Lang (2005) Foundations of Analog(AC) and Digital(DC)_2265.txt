The Figure 16.14 show these waveforms for the case where the transients
only go part-way to completion,
that is,
for the RC time constant long
compared to the period of the square-wave.
The input waveform undergoes an abrupt transition at t1, at the end of
the first half-cycle, dropping to −10 volts. Because vC had been positive, the
constraint of Equation 16.23 now applies, and the circuit is forced into the ON
state. Physically, the diode is ON, so the capacitor is connected directly across
vi, and vo is zero. Note that for this over-idealized circuit the capacitor voltage
is forced to change instantaneously from some positive voltage to −10 volts
in response to the input transition. A more realistic model which included
either diode forward resistance or a resistance associated with the source would
eliminate this anomaly, and produce a rapid transition in vC rather than an
instantaneous jump.
