In figure 1-50, the rf carrier is applied to the grid of V1 and the modulating signal is applied in series 
with the cathode through T1. Since the modulating signal is effectively in series with the grid and plate 
voltage, the level of modulating voltage required will be determined by the relationships of the three 
voltages. The modulation takes place in the plate circuit with the plate tank developing the modulation 
envelope, just as it did in the plate modulator.
