This section will describe the function of the front panel controls, indicators, and connectors. For a
complete description of each function, refer to table 6-1 while reviewing the front panel in figure 6-43.
The numbers located in column 1 of table 6-1 equate to the same numbers found on the front panel of
figure 6-43. Because most operational functions of this spectrum analyzer are microprocessor-controlled,
they are switch-selected rather than adjusted.
