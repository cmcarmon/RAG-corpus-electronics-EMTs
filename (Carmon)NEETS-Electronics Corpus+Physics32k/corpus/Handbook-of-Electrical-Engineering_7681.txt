Selecting the proper transconductance for each transistor is an important focus of the designer. The accessing
transistors should be large enough to extract a large read signal but insufÔ¨Åciently large to disturb the stored
information. During the write operation, these same transistors must be capable of overriding the current drive
of at least one of the internal CMOS inverters.
