For waves traveling through three dimensions, such as light waves, sound waves, and matter waves, the formulas for phase and group velocity are generalized in a straightforward way:
One dimension:




v

p


=
ω

/

k
,


v

g


=



∂
ω


∂
k



,



{\displaystyle v_{p}=\omega /k,\quad v_{g}={\frac {\partial \omega }{\partial k}},\,}

Three dimensions:

k




ω



{\displaystyle \mathbf {v} _{p}={\hat {\mathbf {k} }}{\frac {\omega }{|\mathbf {k} |}},\quad \mathbf {v} _{g}={\vec {\nabla }}_{\mathbf {k} }\,\omega \,}

where








∇
→





k




ω


{\displaystyle {\vec {\nabla }}_{\mathbf {k} }\,\omega }

means the gradient of the angular frequency ω as a function of the wave vector




k



{\displaystyle \mathbf {k} }
, and







k

^





{\displaystyle {\hat {\mathbf {k} }}}
is the unit vector in direction k.
If the waves are propagating through an anisotropic (i.e., not rotationally symmetric) medium, for example a crystal, then the phase velocity vector and group velocity vector may point in different directions.
