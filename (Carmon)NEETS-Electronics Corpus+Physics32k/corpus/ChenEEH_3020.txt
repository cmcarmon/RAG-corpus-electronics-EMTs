has been proposed for tapered-slot antennas, such as imaging
arrays and power combining. The quasi-Yagi antenna has
several additional advantages over the tapered slot including
narrower width, direct microstrip feeding, and the ability to
design on a high-permittivity substrate. Moreover, radiation
efﬁciency may be improved because of the truncated ground
plane. This will eliminate losses due to TM0 mode in the
antenna region that may be a signiﬁcant loss mechanism
with the TSA antenna. More about the quasi-Yagi antenna
may be found in Qian et al. (1998) and Deal et al. (1999).
