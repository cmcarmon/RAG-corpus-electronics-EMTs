The amount of power lost, then, is proportional to 
the amount of resistance in the line. The easiest way to 
reduce power losses is to keep the current low.
EXamPlE:	 A power station produces 8500 volts at 
10Â amperes. The power lines have 100 ohms of resis-
tance. What is the power loss of the lines?
