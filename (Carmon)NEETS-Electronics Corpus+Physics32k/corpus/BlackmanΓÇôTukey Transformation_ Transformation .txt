In electrical and electronic engineering, transformation from time domain to another domain such as frequency domain is used to focus more on details of the waveform. Many of the details can be analyzed much easier when this transformation is done to waveform, when it goes to another domain. Different methods are present to do transformation from time domain to frequency domain; one of them is the Blackmanâ€“Tukey Transformation method that also uses Fast Fourier Transform. To meet the filter specification according to requirements, several methods are used, including windowing effect.
