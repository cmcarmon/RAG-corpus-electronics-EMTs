The origin of the extremely large permeabilities of ferromag-
netic materials is the existence of magnetized domains in these
materials (Plonus, 1978; Kittel, 1996). A magnetized domain
is a microscopic region (on the order of 0.1 to 1 mm3) where
the magnetization is uniform and saturated. Between adjacent
domains are domain walls. Without an external ﬁeld (at point
O in Figure 1.6), these domains are randomly orientated so
that the net magnetization of the material is zero. In the
presence of external magnetic ﬁelds, these domains align and
produce an enormous secondary B in the same direction as the
applied ﬁeld, thus giving a possibly enormous permeability.
