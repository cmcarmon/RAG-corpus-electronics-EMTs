collector  and  emitter.  It  is,  of  course,  not  possible 
to provide an accurate indication of current gain by 
this method however it will tell you whether or not 
a transistor is producing current gain. The method   
will  also  let  you  compare  the  current  gain  of  one 
(known)  transistor  with  another.  The  equivalent 
arrangement  for  testing  a  PNP  transistor  is  shown 
in Fig. 15.11.
