P systems are becoming more RISC (reduced instruction set computer) oriented. The
object is to execute one instruction per clock period (versus the prevailing 3 to 7 cycles) and to obtain a more

C systems are CISC processors. For a user it makes little
regular processor structure. The most popular 
difference what the internal structure of the processor is; the availability of user support software is far more
critical. The trend is to make processors simpler, thus speeding up program execution, even if some programs
may have to use more program steps in replacing many “convenience” instructions.
