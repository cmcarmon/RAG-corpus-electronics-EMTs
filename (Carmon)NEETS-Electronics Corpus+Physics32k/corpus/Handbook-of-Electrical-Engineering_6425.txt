Adaptive Filters for MLSE
For unknown and/or slowly time-varying channels, the receive ﬁlter must be adaptive in order to obtain the
ultimate performance gain from MLSE (maximum-likelihood sequence estimation). Secondly, the complexity
of  the  MLSE  becomes  prohibitive  for  practical  channels  with  a  large  number  of  ISI  terms.  Therefore,  in  a
practical receiver, an adaptive receive ﬁlter may be used prior to Viterbi detection to limit the time spread of
the channel as well as to track slow time variation in the channel characteristics [Falconer and Magee, 1973].
Several  adaptive  receive  ﬁlters  are  available  that  minimize  the  MSE  at  the  input  to  the Viterbi  algorithm.
These methods differ in the form of constraint [Falconer and Magee, 1973] on the desired impulse response
(DIR) which is necessary in this optimization process to exclude the selection of the null DIR corresponding
to no transmission through the channel. The general form of such a receiver is shown in Fig. 70.13.
