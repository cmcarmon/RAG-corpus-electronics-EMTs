You now have a voltage divider as illustrated in figure 4-25. You should see that because of the 
impedance ratios, a large amount of ripple voltage is dropped across L1, and a substantially smaller 
amount is dropped across C1 and RL. You can further increase the ripple voltage across L1 by increasing 
the inductance (XL = 2pifL).
