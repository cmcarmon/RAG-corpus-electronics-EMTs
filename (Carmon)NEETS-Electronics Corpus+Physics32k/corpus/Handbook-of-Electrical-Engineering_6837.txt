Detection of Random Signals
In  some  applications,  particularly  in  remote  sensing  applications  such  as  sonar  and  radio  astronomy,  it  is
appropriate to consider the signal sequence S1, S2, . . ., Sn itself to be a random sequence, statistically independent
of the noise. In such cases, the likelihood ratio formula of (73.6) is still valid with the parameter vector u simply
taken to be the signal itself. However, for long measurement records (i.e., large n), (73.6) is not a very practical
formula except in some speciÔ¨Åc cases, the most important of which is the case in which the signal is Gaussian.
