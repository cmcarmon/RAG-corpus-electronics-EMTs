The first spacecraft to impact the Earth's Moon was the USSR Luna 2 on September 14, 1959. For a complete list of spacecraft impacts and controlled landings on the Moon, see List of man-made objects on the Moon. Also see Timeline of Moon exploration and List of lunar probes.
There have been no spacecraft collisions with the Martian moons.
There have been no spacecraft collisions with any Jovian moons. Note that to avoid collision with Europa and possible contamination by Earth microbes, the NASA Galileo spacecraft was intentionally deorbited into Jupiter's atmosphere on September 21, 2003.
There have been no spacecraft collisions with any Saturnian moons. But note that the ESA Huygens probe made a controlled landing on Titan on January 14, 2005.
