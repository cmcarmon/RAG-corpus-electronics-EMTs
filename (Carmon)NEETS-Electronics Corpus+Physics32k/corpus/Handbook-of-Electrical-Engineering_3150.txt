Voltage Source Inverter
A three-phase voltage source inverter conﬁguration is shown in Fig. 30.13(a). The VSIs are controlled either
in square-wave mode or in pulsewidth-modulated (PWM) mode. In square-wave mode, the frequency of the
output voltage is controlled within the inverter, the devices being used to switch the output circuit between
the plus and minus bus. Each device conducts for 180 degrees, and each of the outputs is displaced 120 degrees
to generate a six-step waveform, as shown in Fig. 30.13(b). The amplitude of the output voltage is controlled
by varying the dc link voltage. This is done by varying the ﬁring angle of the thyristors of the three-phase bridge
converter at the input. The square-wave-type VSI is not suitable if the dc source is a battery. The six-step output
voltage is rich in harmonics and thus needs heavy ﬁltering.
