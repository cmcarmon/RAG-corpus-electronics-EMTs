DSP application-speciﬁc integrated circuits (ASICs) are mostly
implemented in digital CMOS circuit technology due to sev-
eral advantages and maturity of fabrication technology. Other
than an ASIC design in a large volume, ﬁeld-programmable
gate array (FPGA) and reconﬁgurable computing (RC) have
been invented to amortize the cost in a low to medium
volume. As the application advances toward multiprotocol
mobile/wireless computing/communication. RC may emerge
as an alternative to hard-wired ASIC. In this section, we put
the emphasis on current state-of-the-art FPGA and RC imple-
mentation technology and tools.
