quantities. The notation mant (a) is used to denote the man-
tissa of the ﬂoating point number a treated as an integers. For
example, considering 4-bit mantissas and integers, if 1.100 is
the mantissa portion of a, with its implicit binary point shown,
then the value of the mantissa is 1.5 in decimal. However, mant
(a) ¼ 1100 and has value 12 in decimal. Furthermore,
for a vector v:¼ (v1, . . ., vn)T , mant (v):¼ (mant) (v1), . . .,
mant(vn))T , and for a matrix A:¼ [ai, j], Amant :¼ mant
(A):¼ [mant (ai, j) ]. The :¼ symbol is used to denote equal-
ity by deﬁnition, ¼ to denote the standard (derived) equality,
and ¼? to denote an equality test of two quantities that are
theoretically supposed to be equal but may not be due to errors
and/or round-off.
