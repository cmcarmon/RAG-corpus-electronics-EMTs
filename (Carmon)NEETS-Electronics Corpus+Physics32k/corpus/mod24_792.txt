In the star topology, each equipment is connected to a common center hub (see figure 8-4). The
center hub can be a passive fiber optic star coupler or an active equipment. If the center hub is a passive
star coupler, each equipment transmitter is connected to an input port of the coupler and an output port of
the coupler is connected to each equipment receiver. The connection between any two equipments is a
simple point-to-point link through the star coupler. If the center hub is an active equipment, the
connection between any two equipments consists of two point-to-point links. Each connection consists of
one link from the first equipment to the center hub and a second link from the center hub to the second
equipment.
