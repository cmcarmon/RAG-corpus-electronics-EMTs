Petrothermal  Source
.  Some  Ô¨Åelds  have  only  hot  rocks  under  the  surface.  Utilization  of  this  petrothermal
source  requires  pumping  surface  water  through  a  well  in  a  constructed  hole  to  a  reservoir.  The  hot  water  is
then  recovered  through  another  well.  The  problem  is  the  formation  of  a  reservoir.  The  U.S.  government  is
studying practical uses of petrothermal sources.
