Materials in general have a characteristic behavior of resisting the ï¬‚ow
of electric charge. This physical property, or ability to resist current, is
known  as  resistance and  is  represented  by  the  symbol  R.  The  resist-
ance of any material with a uniform cross-sectional area A depends on
/
, as shown in Fig. 2.1(a). We can represent resistance
A and its length 
(as measured in the laboratory), in mathematical form,
