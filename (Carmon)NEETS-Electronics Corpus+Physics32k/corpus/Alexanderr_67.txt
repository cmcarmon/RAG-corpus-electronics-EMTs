A loop is a closed path formed by starting at a node, passing through a
set of nodes, and returning to the starting node without passing through
any node more than once. A loop is said to be independent if it contains
at  least  one  branch  which  is  not  a  part  of  any  other  independent  loop.
Independent loops or paths result in independent sets of equations.
