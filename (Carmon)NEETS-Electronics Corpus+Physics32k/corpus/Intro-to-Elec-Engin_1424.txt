Figure 15.1.11(c) gives the noise-free model with noise bandwidth BN (a rectangular passband
of width BN in hertz centered on f 0). The actual receiver is replaced by an idealized one with the
same nominal power gain Ga(f 0) and a constant (average) effective input noise temperature ¯TR,
which is related to the average standard noise ﬁgure F0;
¯TR = 290(F0 − 1)
