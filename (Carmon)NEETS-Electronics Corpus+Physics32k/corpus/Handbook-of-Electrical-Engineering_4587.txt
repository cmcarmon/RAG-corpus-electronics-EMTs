Sampling: The  process  of  replacing  a  continuous  physical  quantity  by  some  sequence  of  sampled  values.
These values are associated with the analytical function used to approximate the behavior of the physical
quantity whose solution is sought and are the unknowns of the moment-method matrix. Sampling is
also involved in determining how well the deﬁning equations are to be satisﬁed. A common approach
for equation sampling is point sampling, where the equations are explicitly satisﬁed at a series of discrete
points in some prescribed region of space. Unknown sampling can involve localized basis functions, an
approach called subdomain sampling, while if the basis functions reside over the entire region occupied
by the unknown, the approach is called entire-domain sampling.
