able blocks. Terminals, line printers, and network interfaces are
typical examples of character special ﬁles. A program can
interact with the user’s terminal by reading and writing the
corresponding character special ﬁle. In UNIX and MS-DOS,
when a process is started up, ﬁle descriptor 0, called standard
input, is normally arranged to refer to the terminal for the
purpose of reading. File descriptor 1, called standard output,
refers to the terminal for writing. File descriptor 2, called
standard error, also refers to the terminal for output but is
used only for writing error messages.
