Energy transmission with a rotating shaft is very common in engineering practice. Often the torque T applied to the shaft is constant which means that the force F applied is constant. For a specified constant torque, the work done during n revolutions is determined as follows: A force F acting through a moment arm r generates a torque T




T
=
F
r



{\displaystyle T=Fr\,}
→



F
=


T
r




{\displaystyle F={\frac {T}{r}}}

This force acts through a distance s, which is related to the radius r by




s

2

(

r

)



{\displaystyle s=2\left(r\pi n\right)}

The shaft work is then determined from:





W

{\displaystyle W_{s}=Fs=2\pi nT}

The power transmitted through the shaft is the shaft work done per unit time, which is expressed as
