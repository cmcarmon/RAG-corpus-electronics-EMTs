Although the Wilkinson structure is probably the most popu-
lar choice in the design of a power divider/combiner, other
solutions may be useful alternatives when certain design re-
quirements such as phase, power level, bandwidth, operating
frequency, combining efﬁciency, and compactness may not be
satisﬁed with the Wilkinson structure. These alternatives may
be classed as resonant and nonresonant structures and are
detailed in Chang (1989). In general, the nonresonant type is
more useful, providing broader operating bandwidth. Among
them,
the corporate (binary-tree type) network may use
hybrids, directional couplers, and Wilkinson topology that
depend on the required phase relationship of the inputs and
the outputs. The N-way network may use spatial or quasi-
optical techniques or radial lines and generalized Wilkinson
topology. Innovative dividing/combining approaches, have
also been developed, such as multihole planar patch dividers/
combiners (Kobeissi and Wu, 1999).
