To apply the node method, we first choose a ground node and label the
node voltages as illustrated in Figure 4.10. vD is our only unknown node voltage.
Next, following the node method, we write KCL for the node that has an
unknown node voltage. As prescribed by the node method, we will use KVL
and the device relation (iD = Kv 2
D) to obtain the currents directly in terms of the
node voltage differences and element parameters. For the node with voltage vD,
