The SHIELDED PAIR, shown in figure 3-5, consists of parallel conductors separated from each
other and surrounded by a solid dielectric. The conductors are contained within a braided copper tubing
that acts as an electrical shield. The assembly is covered with a rubber or flexible composition coating
that protects the line from moisture and mechanical damage. Outwardly, it looks much like the power
cord of a washing machine or refrigerator.
