If you replace the battery with a simple wire, you provide a path through  
the bulb for the surplus electrons on one plate to follow to the other  
(electron‐deficient) plate. The capacitor plates discharge through the light 
bulb, lighting it up again briefly — even without a battery in the circuit — 
until the charge on both plates is neutralized. The electrical energy that had 
been stored in the capacitor is consumed by the light bulb. When the capaci-
tor is discharged (again, it’s really the plates that discharge), no more current 
will flow.
