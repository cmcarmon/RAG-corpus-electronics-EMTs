As indicated previously, angle measurement generally is the limiting factor in measurement accuracy. Target
azimuth  and  elevation  position  is  primarily  measured  by  a  monopulse  technique  in  modern  radars  though
early  systems  used  sequential  lobing  and  conical  scanning.  Specialized  monopulse  tracking  radars  utilizing
