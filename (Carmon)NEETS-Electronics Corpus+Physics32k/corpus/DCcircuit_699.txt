The purpose of any null detector is to act like a laboratory balance scale, indicating when
the two voltages are equal (absence of voltage between points 1 and 2) and nothing more.
The laboratory scale balance beam doesnâ€™t actually weigh anything; rather, it simply indicates
equality between the unknown mass and the pile of standard (calibrated) masses.
