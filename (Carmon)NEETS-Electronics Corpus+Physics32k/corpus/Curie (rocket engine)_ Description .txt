The Curie engine, named after Polish scientist Marie Curie, is a small liquid-propellant rocket engine designed to release "small satellites from the constricting parameters of primary payload orbits and enables them to full reach their potential, including faster deployment of small satellite constellations and better positioning for Earth imaging". It is equipped with its own reaction control system, avionics, power, and communication systems. It produces 120 N (27 lbf) of thrust and is 3D printed.
During its first mission, it coasted for roughly 40 minutes after successfully deploying an Earth-imaging Dove satellite built by the company Planet, and then ignited.  During the first launch of the stage, the stage was left in orbit. However, Rocket Lab mentioned that future launches would have the stage deorbited after releasing their payloads to prevent addition to space debris.
