Hysteresis loss is a heat loss caused by the magnetic properties of the armature. When an armature 
core is in a magnetic field, the magnetic particles of the core tend to line up with the magnetic field. When 
the armature core is rotating, its magnetic field keeps changing direction. The continuous movement of 
the magnetic particles, as they try to align themselves with the magnetic field, produces molecular 
friction. This, in turn, produces heat. This heat is transmitted to the armature windings. The heat causes 
armature resistances to increase.
