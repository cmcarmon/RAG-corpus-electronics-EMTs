So, through their element laws, the branch voltages across all twelve resistors are known,
leaving the branch voltage across the current source as the only remaining unknown.
Finally through the application of KVL around any loop that passes through the current
source we see that its branch voltage is 5RI/6. Dividing this voltage by I yields 5R/6 as
the equivalent resistance of the cubic network of resistors.
