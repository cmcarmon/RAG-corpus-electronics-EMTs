With overhead line insulators or bushings of electrical equipment, breakdown may occur along the surface
rather than in the bulk of the material. Insulator surfaces consisting of porcelain, glass, or polymeric materials
(usually elastomers), may become contaminated by either industrial pollutants or salt spray near coastal areas,
leading to surface tracking and breakdown below the normal ﬂashover voltage. Surface tracking is enhanced
in  the  presence  of  moisture,  which  increases  the  surface  conductivity,  particularly  in  the  presence  of  ionic
contaminants [Bartnikas, 1987]. The latter is measured in S or V–1 and must be distinguished from the volume
