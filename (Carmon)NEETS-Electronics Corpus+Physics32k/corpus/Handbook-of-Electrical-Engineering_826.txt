which  is  obviously  bounded.  Therefore,  all  equilibrium  states  are  stable,  but  the  condition  of  Part  2  of  the
theorem is violated again, since l1= 1 with unit absolute value having a multiplicity n.
Remark 2. The  following  extension  of  Theorem  12.5  can  be  proven.  The  equilibrium  state  is  stable  if  and
only if for all eigenvalues of A, Re li £ 0 (or *li
* £ 1), and if li is a repeated eigenvalue of A such that Re li =
0 (or *li
