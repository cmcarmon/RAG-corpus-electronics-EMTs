Electrodynamic wattmeters are subject to errors arising from such factors as temperature and
frequency. For example, heat through the coils eventually causes the small springs attached to the pointer
to lengthen and lose tension, which produces deflection errors. Large currents through the wattmeter also
produce a noticeable deflection error. These errors are caused by the heat (I2R) loss through coils from the
application of high currents. Because of this, the maximum current range of electrodynamic wattmeters is
normally restricted to approximately 20 amperes. The voltage range of wattmeters is usually limited to
several hundred volts because of heat dissipation within the voltage circuit. However, the voltage range
can be extended by the use of voltage multipliers.
