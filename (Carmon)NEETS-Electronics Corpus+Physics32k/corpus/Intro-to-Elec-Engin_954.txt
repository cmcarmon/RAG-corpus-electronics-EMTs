*11.4.12 The efﬁciency of a 400-kVA, single-phase, 60-Hz
transformer is 98.77% when delivering full-load
current at 0.8 power factor, and 99.13% with half-
rated current at unity power factor. Calculate:
(a) The iron loss.
(b) The full-load copper loss.
(c) The efﬁciency at 3/4 load, 0.9 power factor.
11.4.13 A transformer has its maximum efﬁciency of
0.9800 when it delivers 15 kVA at unity power
factor. During the day it is loaded as follows:
12 hours
6 hours
6 hours
Determine the all-day efﬁciency.
