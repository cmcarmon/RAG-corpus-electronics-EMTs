Thermistors  are  resistive  elements  made  of  semiconductor  materials  and  have  a  negative  coefﬁcient  of
resistance. The mechanism governing the resistance change of a thermistor is the increase in the number of
conducting electrons with an increase in temperature due to thermal generation, i.e., the electrons which are
the  least  tightly  bound  to  the  nucleus  (valence  electrons)  gain  sufﬁcient  thermal  energy  to  break  away  and
become inﬂuenced by external ﬁelds. Thermistors can be measured in the same manner as resistance thermom-
eters, but thermistors have up to 100 times higher TCR values.
