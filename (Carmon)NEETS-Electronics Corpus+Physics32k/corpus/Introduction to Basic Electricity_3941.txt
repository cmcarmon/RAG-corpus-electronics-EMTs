rf (radio-frequency) amplifiers usually are the 
first stage in AM, FM, or TV receivers and are sim-
ilar to other amplifiers. They differ primarily in the 
frequency spectrum over which they operate, which 
is 10,000 hertz to 30,000 megahertz. There are two 
classes of RF amplifiers: untuned and tuned. In an 
 untuned amplifier, a response is desired over a 
large RF range, and the main function is amplifica-
tion. In a tuned amplifier, high amplification is 
desired over a small range of frequencies or a single 
frequency.  Normally, when RF amplifiers are men-
tioned, they are assumed to be tuned unless otherwise 
specified.
