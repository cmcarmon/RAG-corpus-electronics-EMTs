Petit  mal  epilepsy  is  characterized  by  a  tran-
sient  loss  (few  to  20  s)  of  conscious  thought,
although  motor  activity  may  continue.  Often
there are eye movements and blinking. The EEG
shows  a  characteristic  3  per  second  spike-and-
wave pattern [Fig. 113.22(A)]. Psychomotor epi-
lepsy  is  characterized  by  sensory  hallucinations
and  abnormal  thoughts,  often  with  stereotyped
behavior. During the attack, the subject is stupor-
ous  and  the  EEG  [Fig.  113.22(B])  has  a  charac-
teristic  pattern.  Jacksonian,  or  motor,  epilepsy
starts in a speciﬁc area of the motor cortex and is
preceded  by  an  aura,  a  characteristic  sensation
perceived  by  the  subject.  The  convulsion  starts
with localized muscle twitching that often starts
in  the  face,  hand,  arm,  then  spreads  over  the
entire  body  as  a  generalized  convulsion;  Fig.
113.22(C) shows the onset of a convulsion. Con-
sciousness is lost during and for a short time after
the ﬁt. The EEG provides information on the origin of the abnormal discharge in the motor cortex. Grand mal
epilepsy is characterized by a contraction all the muscles (tonic phase), then jerking (clonic phase). Conscious-
ness is lost, and the subject is in a coma for some time following the attack. The EEG [Fig. 113.22(D)] shows
high-voltage, high-frequency waves that progress over the entire cortex.
