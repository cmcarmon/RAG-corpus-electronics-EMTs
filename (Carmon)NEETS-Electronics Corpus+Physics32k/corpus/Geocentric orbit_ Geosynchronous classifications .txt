Semi-synchronous orbit (SSO) - An orbit with an altitude of approximately 20,200 km (12,600 mi) and an orbital period of approximately 12 hours
Geosynchronous orbit (GEO) - Orbits with an altitude of approximately 35,786 km (22,236 mi). Such a satellite would trace an analemma (figure 8) in the sky.

Geostationary orbit (GSO): A geosynchronous orbit with an inclination of zero. To an observer on the ground this satellite would appear as a fixed point in the sky.

Clarke orbit - Another name for a geostationary orbit. Named after the writer Arthur C. Clarke.

Earth orbital libration points: The libration points for objects orbiting Earth are at 105 degrees west and 75 degrees east. More than 160 satellites are gathered at these two points.

Supersynchronous orbit - A disposal / storage orbit above GSO/GEO. Satellites will drift west.

Subsynchronous orbit - A drift orbit close to but below GSO/GEO. Satellites will drift east.

Graveyard orbit - An orbit a few hundred kilometers above geosynchronous that satellites are moved into at the end of their operation.

Disposal orbit - A synonym for graveyard orbit.

Junk orbit - A synonym for graveyard orbit.
