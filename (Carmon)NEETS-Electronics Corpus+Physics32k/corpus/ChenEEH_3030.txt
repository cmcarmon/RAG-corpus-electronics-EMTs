Although the ﬁrst electric power system, Edison’s Pearl Street
system, was based on direct current (dc), the advantages of
alternating current (ac) systems were obvious by the turn of
the 20th century. The voltage drop in an electrical circuit limited
the distance from the source of electricity to where it was
consumed. The Westinghouse transformer made it possible to
boost and lower voltage levels in ac systems, making it possible
early on to bring electricity into Buffalo, NY, and Portland, OR,
from generators at waterfalls many miles away. Further, the
Tesla induction motor replaced all steam-driven manufacturing
machinery because it was more clean and ﬂexible, thus ensuring
the usage of ac as the preferred technology. Despite this, some
pockets of dc power systems survived until after World War II.
The choice of a three-phase transmission and distribution
system over a single-phase system also came very early because
of the increased efﬁciency of transmitting power. Although the
use of electricity at the consuming end is in one phase low
voltage (except for very large industrial use), transmission and
distribution are always done in a three-phase system. To
understand the efﬁciency of transmitting power, consider the
discussion following section.
