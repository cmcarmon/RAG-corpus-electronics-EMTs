(cid:1) The resistance of a planar piece of material with length L and width W is
Ã— R2, where R2 is the resistance of a square piece of material.
(cid:1) The four ideal circuit elements are the ideal conductor, the ideal linear
resistor, the voltage source, and the current source. The element law for
the ideal conductor is
