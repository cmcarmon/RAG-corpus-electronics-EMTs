Electric circuits, which are collections of circuit elements connected together, are the most
fundamental structures of electrical engineering. A circuit is an interconnection of simple elec-
trical devices that have at least one closed path in which current may ﬂow. However, we may
have to clarify to some of our readers what is meant by “current” and “electrical device,” a
task that we shall undertake shortly. Circuits are important in electrical engineering because
they process electrical signals, which carry energy and information; a signal can be any time-
varying electrical quantity. Engineering circuit analysis is a mathematical study of some useful
interconnection of simple electrical devices. An electric circuit, as discussed in this book, is
an idealized mathematical model of some physical circuit or phenomenon. The ideal circuit
elements are the resistor, the inductor, the capacitor, and the voltage and current sources. The
ideal circuit model helps us to predict, mathematically, the approximate behavior of the actual
event. The models also provide insights into how to design a physical electric circuit to perform a
desired task. Electrical engineering is concerned with the analysis and design of electric circuits,
systems, and devices. In Chapter 1 we shall deal with the fundamental concepts that underlie
all circuits.
