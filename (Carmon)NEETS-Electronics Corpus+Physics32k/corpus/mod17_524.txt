Figure 4-13 is a typical shipboard receive-only system. In this system the transmitted carrier may be 
frequency modulated (fm) or phase-shift-key (psk) modulated for tty operation. The receiving antennas 
for this system are positioned about the ship. They are arranged in a manner (normally one in each 
quadrant of the ship) that at no time allows the line-of-sight to be blocked between the relay satellite and 
one or more of the antennas. Incoming signals pass from the antennas to an amplifier-converter. Each 
amplifier-converter routes an IF signal on one line of a twin axial cable that connects it to the combiner-
demodulator. An operating power and local-oscillator signal are coupled from the combiner-demodulator 
to each amplifier-converter on the other line of the cable used for the IF signal. Because of signal path 
variations, shading, and reflections, the incoming signals are subject to random phase and amplitude 
variations. The combiner operation performed within the combiner-demodulator removes the phase 
variations from each input signal. It then measures the amplitudes of the signals for optimum combining 
and sums the signals. After being combined, the signal is demodulated and coupled from a receiver 
transfer switchboard to a telegraph demultiplex terminal.
