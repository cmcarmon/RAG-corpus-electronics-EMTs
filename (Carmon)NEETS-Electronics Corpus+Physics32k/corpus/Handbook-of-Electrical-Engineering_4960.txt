The ceramic materials modiﬁed lead zirconate and modiﬁed lead titanate are interesting in that they possess
high pyroelectric coefﬁcients with relatively high permittivities and low losses. The modiﬁed lead zirconate is
a solid solution of lead zirconate with lead iron niobate and lead titanate, with small additions of uranium as
a  stabilizing  dopant.  The  use  of  uranium  in  this  material  minimizes  the  dielectric  constant  and  loss  (thus
maximizing FD)  while  also  permitting  control  over  the  electrical  resistivity,  allowing  the  gate  bias  resistor  in
