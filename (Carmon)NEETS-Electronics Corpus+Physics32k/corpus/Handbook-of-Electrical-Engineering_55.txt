Varistors  in  Series.  The  resultant  k  value  of  n  varistors  connected  in  series  is  nk.  This  can  be  derived  by
considering n varistors connected in series and a voltage nV applied across the ends. The current through each
varistor remains the same as for V volts over one varistor. Mathematically, the voltage and current are expressed
as
