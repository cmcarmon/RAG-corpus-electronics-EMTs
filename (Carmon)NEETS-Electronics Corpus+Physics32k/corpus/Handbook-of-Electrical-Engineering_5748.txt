1. It determines the number of discontinuities in any eigenvalue that have already occurred due to generator
PV to load PQ bus type changes that are associated with an eigenvalue compared to the total number
that are needed to produce voltage instability when the eigenvalue becomes negative. The eigenvalue is
associated with a coherent bus group (voltage control area) [Schlueter, 1998a; f]. The subset of generators
that experience PV-PQ bus type changes (reactive reserve basin) for computing a Q-V curve at any bus
in  that  bus  group  are  proven  to  capture  the  number  of  discontinuities  in  that  eigenvalue  [Schlueter,
1998a; f]. An eigenvalue approximation for the agent, composed of the test voltage control area where
the Q-V current is computed and its reactive reserve basin, is used to theoretically justify the deﬁnitions
of a voltage control area and the reactive reserve basin of an agent. The VSSAD agents are thus proven
to capture eigenvalue structure of the loadﬂow jacobian evaluated at any operating point (x0, p0). The
reactive reserve on generators in each voltage control area of a reactive reserve basin is proven to measure
proximity to each of the remaining discontinuities in the eigenvalue required for bifurcation.
