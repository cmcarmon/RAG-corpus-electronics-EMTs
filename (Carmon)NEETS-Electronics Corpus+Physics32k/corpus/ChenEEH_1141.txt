DMD have been incorporated into what are called dis-
play engines and sold to manufacturers of conference room
projectors for several years. It is estimated that some tens of
thousands of these display engines are sold annually. Texas
Instruments has started testing their use in movie theaters.
This will enable digital distribution of movies so that handling
of celluloid rolls for distribution of movies to theaters will no
longer be necessary. In the future, DMD might be employed in
homes as a replacement for the large and heavy tubes in
current television sets. The bright and high-resolution charac-
ter of images displayed using DMD technology is attractive.
The DMD, however,
is in competition with other MEMS
display devices and with liquid crystal display technologies.
