Applications
Historically the material which was used earliest for its piezoelectric properties was single-crystal quartz. Crude
sonar devices were built by Langevin using quartz transducers, but the most important application was, and
still is, frequency control. Crystal oscillators are today at the heart of every clock that does not derive its frequency
reference from the ac power line. They are also used in every color television set and personal computer. In
these  applications  at  least  one  (or  more) “quartz  crystal”  controls  frequency  or  time.  This  explains  the  label
“quartz” which appears on many clocks and watches. The use of quartz resonators for frequency control relies
on  another  unique  property.  Not  only  is  the  material  piezoelectric  (which  allows  one  to  excite  mechanical

inﬂuence of temperature on the vibration frequency.
