Consider implementing an ABC by using an impedance-
matched electromagnetic wave absorbing layer adjacent to
the outer planes of
the
absorbing medium is only a few lattice cells thick, reﬂectionless
to all impinging waves over their full frequency spectrum,
highly absorbing, and effective in the near ﬁeld of a source or
a scatterer. An early attempt at
implementing such an
absorbing material boundary condition was reported by Hol-
land and Williams (1983) who utilized a conventional lossy,
dispersionless, and absorbing medium. The difﬁculty with this
tactic is that such an absorbing layer is matched only to
normally incident plane waves.
