Radar systems also have some characteristics in common with telescopes. Both provide only a
limited field of view and require reference coordinate systems to define the positions of detected objects.
If you describe the location of an object as you see it through a telescope, you will most likely refer to
prominent features of the landscape. Radar requires a more precise reference system. Radar surface
angular measurements are normally made in a clockwise direction from TRUE NORTH, as shown in
figure 1-2, or from the heading line of a ship or aircraft. The surface of the earth is represented by an
imaginary flat plane, tangent (or parallel) to the earthâ€™s surface at that location. This plane is referred to as
the HORIZONTAL PLANE. All angles in the up direction are measured in a second imaginary plane that
is perpendicular to the horizontal plane.
