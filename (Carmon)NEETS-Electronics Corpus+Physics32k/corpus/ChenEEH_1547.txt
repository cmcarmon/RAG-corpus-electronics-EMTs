Expert systems offer a number of beneﬁts when compared
with human experts. Expertise embodied in an expert system is
permanent, like other software, whereas human expertise is
perishable. Expert systems can produce consistent results on
the same tasks and handle similar situations consistently,
whereas humans can get tired or bored and are inﬂuenced by
various effects (e.g., their judgment can be easily impacted
by new information). Expert systems are inexpensive to
operate, easy to reproduce and distribute, and can provide
permanent documentation of the decision process. In ad-
dition, expert systems may contain knowledge from several
human experts, giving them more breadth and robustness
than a single expert.
