The normalized functions p
, are called the total-,
theta-, and phi-power radiation patterns, respectively. Similarly,
are called the total-, theta-, and phi-ﬁeld radiation
f , f
patterns, respectively. An example of a total power-radiation
(u, f ¼ f0),
pattern, p
is shown in Figure 6.2 in both
rectangular and polar forms. Radiation patterns are normally
plotted with respect to one angle variable, u or f, keeping the
other variable ﬁxed. Alternatively, the radiation pattern may be
plotted using a three-dimensional (3-D) graph, including both
u and f variables.
