It was already observed by Gromov that the natural action by translations of a word-hyperbolic group



G


{\displaystyle G}
on its boundary



∂
G


{\displaystyle \partial G}
is a uniform convergence action (see for a formal proof). Bowditch proved an important converse, thus obtaining a topological characterization of word-hyperbolic groups:
Theorem. Let



G


{\displaystyle G}
act as a discrete uniform convergence group on a compact metrizable space



M


{\displaystyle M}
with no isolated points. Then the group



G


{\displaystyle G}
is word-hyperbolic and there exists a



G


{\displaystyle G}
-equivariant homeomorphism



M
→
∂
G


{\displaystyle M\to \partial G}
.
