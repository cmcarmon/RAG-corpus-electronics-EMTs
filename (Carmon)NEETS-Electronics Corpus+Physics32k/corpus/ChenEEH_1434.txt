develop run-time reconﬁgurable designs
for multi-FPGA
systems, such as the Splash 2 platform (Buell et al., 1996) or
the Sonic system (Haynes et al., 2000). Although many existing
platforms (Guccione, 2000) contain multiple FPGAs that are
not partially reconﬁgurable, the platforms themselves are often
partially reconﬁgurable.
