Silicon-controlled rectifiers are the best known of 
the thyristors and are generally referred to as ScRs. 
They have three terminals (anode, cathode, and gate) 
and are used primarily as switches. An SCR is basi-
cally a rectifier because it controls current in only one 
 direction. The advantage of the SCR over a power 
transistor is that it can control a large current, depen-
dent on an external circuit, with a small trigger signal. 
An SCR requires a current flowing to stay turned on 
after the gate signal is removed. If the current flow 
drops to 0, the SCR shuts off and a gate signal must be 
reapplied to turn the SCR back on. A power transistor 
would require 10 times the trigger signal of an SCR to 
control the same amount of current.
