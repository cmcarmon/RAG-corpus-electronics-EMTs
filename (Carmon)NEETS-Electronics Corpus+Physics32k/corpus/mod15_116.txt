To understand how a TDX subtracts one input from another, first consider the conditions in a TX-
TDX-TR system when all the rotors are on 0º, as in view A of figure 1-20. In this case, the TDX is on 
electrical zero and merely passes along the voltages applied to its windings without any change. 
Therefore, the TX stator voltages are felt at the TDX rotor. With the system in perfect balance, the TDX 
rotor voltages equal and oppose the TR stator voltages so that no current flows in the circuit. Since there 
is no current to produce the torque required to move the TR rotor, the system will remain in this 
condition, thus solving the equation 0º − 0º  = 0º.
