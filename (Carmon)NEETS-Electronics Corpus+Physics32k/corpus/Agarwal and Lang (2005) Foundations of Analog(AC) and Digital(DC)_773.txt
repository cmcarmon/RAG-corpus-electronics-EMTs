Second method This implementation develops a two-bit adder circuit by composing
two one-bit adders, and illustrates an important engineering technique called divide-and-
conquer. The one-bit adders are called full adders. As illustrated in Figure 5.29, a full
two one-bit numbers to be added (Ai and Bi), and one carry
adder takes three inputs
bit Ci from a lower digit. The full adder produces two outputs: a sum bit Si and a carry
bit Ci+1 to a higher digit.
