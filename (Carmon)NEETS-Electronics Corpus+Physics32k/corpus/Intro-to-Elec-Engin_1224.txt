where C1, C2, and C3 are constants to be determined by curve-Ô¨Åtting techniques. Figure 13.6.2
depicts typical wind-turbine characteristics of mechanical power versus wind speed for different
values of shaft speed. The two nonzero roots of the curves represent a lower limit for the cut-in
wind speed vci and an upper limit for the cut-out wind speed vco. If the variable-speed operation is
opted and the resulting system is able to follow the wind-speed variations, the operation at optimum
tip-speed ratio can be ensured. In such a case, the power versus wind-speed characteristic will be
as shown by the dashed line in Figure 13.6.2.
