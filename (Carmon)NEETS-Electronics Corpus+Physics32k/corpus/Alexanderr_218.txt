4.10.1 Source Modeling
Source  modeling  provides  an  example  of  the  usefulness  of  the
Thevenin or the Norton equivalent. An active source such as a battery
is often characterized by its Thevenin or Norton equivalent circuit. An
ideal voltage source provides a constant voltage irrespective of the cur-
rent  drawn  by  the  load,  while  an  ideal  current  source  supplies  a  con-
stant  current  regardless  of  the  load  voltage.  As  Fig.  4.58  shows,
practical  voltage  and  current  sources  are  not  ideal,  due  to  their  inter-
nal resistances or source resistances
They become ideal as
Rs  S  0 and Rp  S  ‚¨Å.
To show that this is the case, consider the effect
