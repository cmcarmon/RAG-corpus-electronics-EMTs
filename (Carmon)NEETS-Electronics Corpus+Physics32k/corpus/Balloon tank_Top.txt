A balloon tank is a style of fuel tank used in the Atlas ICBM and Centaur upper stage that does not use an internal framework, but instead relies on a constant internal pressurization to keep its shape.
Balloon tanks are very light, and this permits a good propellant mass fraction.
One disadvantage of balloon tanks is that if pressurisation fails, the vehicle collapses.
