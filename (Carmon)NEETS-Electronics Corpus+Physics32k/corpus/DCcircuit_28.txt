Postulating the existence of a single ”ﬂuid” that was either gained or lost through rubbing
accounted best for the observed behavior: that all these materials fell neatly into one of two
categories when rubbed, and most importantly, that the two active materials rubbed against
each other always fell into opposing categories as evidenced by their invariable attraction to
one another. In other words, there was never a time where two materials rubbed against each
other both became either positive or negative.
