Counters
A register can be loaded with any combination by applying the correct bit pattern to the input data lines and
activating the control line. As with the feedback shift registers, it is then only a small step to arrange that the
register  itself  provides  the  input  data  by  use  of  feedback  connections  and,  if  other  circuitry  is  included  to
increment the value each time, we have a synchronous counter. The 74L5191 (Fig. 81.38) is a programmable
counter which retains the facility for parallel loading of external data.
