• Noise added by the channel adversely aﬀects the signal-to-noise ratio.
In summary, amplitude modulation provides an eﬀective means for sending a bandlimited signal from one
place to another. For wireline channels, using baseband or amplitude modulation makes little diﬀerence in
terms of signal-to-noise ratio. For wireless channels, amplitude modulation is the only alternative. The one
AM parameter that does not aﬀect signal-to-noise ratio is the carrier frequency fc: We can choose any value
we want so long as the transmitter and receiver use the same value. However, suppose someone else wants to
use AM and chooses the same carrier frequency. The two resulting transmissions will add, and both receivers
will produce the sum of the two signals. What we clearly need to do is talk to the other party, and agree to
use separate carrier frequencies. As more and more users wish to use radio, we need a forum for agreeing on
carrier frequencies and on signal bandwidth. On earth, this forum is the government. In the United States,
the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) strictly controls the use of the electromagnetic spectrum
for communications. Separate frequency bands are allocated for commercial AM, FM, cellular telephone
(the analog version of which is AM), short wave (also AM), and satellite communications.
