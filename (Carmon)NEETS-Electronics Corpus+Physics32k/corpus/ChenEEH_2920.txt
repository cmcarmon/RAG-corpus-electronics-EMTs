Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is a radar carried by a moving
vehicle that provides a high-resolution image in both range
and cross-range. The Ô¨Åne range is obtained by transmitting
waveforms with wide bandwidth, and the cross-range reso-
lution is enhanced by moving the antenna to synthesize a
large effective length.
