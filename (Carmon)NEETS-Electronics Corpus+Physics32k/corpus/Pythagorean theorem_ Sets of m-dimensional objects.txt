Another generalization of the Pythagorean theorem, introduced by Donald R. Conant and William A. Beyer, applies to a wide range of objects and sets of objects in any number of dimensions. Specifically, the square of the measure of an m-dimensional set of objects in one or more parallel m-dimensional flats in n-dimensional Euclidean space is equal to the sum of the squares of the measures of the orthogonal projections of the object(s) onto all m-dimensional coordinate subspaces.

{\displaystyle \mu _{m}}
is a measure in m-dimensions (a length in one dimension, an area in two dimensions, a volume in three dimensions, etc.).




s


{\displaystyle s}
is a set of one or more non-overlapping m-dimensional objects in one or more parallel m-dimensional flats in n-dimensional Euclidean space.

{\displaystyle \mu _{ms}}
is the total measure (sum) of the set of m-dimensional objects.

{\displaystyle p}
represents an m-dimensional projection of the original set onto an orthogonal coordinate subspace.

{\displaystyle \mu _{mp_{i}}}

x


{\displaystyle x}
is the number of orthogonal, m-dimensional coordinate subspaces in n-dimensional space (Rn) onto which the m-dimensional objects are projected (m ≤ n):

For example, for a set of one or more two-dimensional parallel objects in three-dimensional space, m = 2 and n = 3. Therefore, the coordinate subspace calculation for this scenario is: x = 3!/2!(3-2)! = 3*2*1/2*1*1 = 6/2 = 3
Thus, three coordinate planes (xy-plane, xz-plane, and yz-plane) are required to capture the necessary projections for calculating the area of the set. If the set contained one-dimensional parallel line segments instead, three coordinate axes (x, y, and z), rather than planes, would be needed to capture the projections for calculating the length of the set.
