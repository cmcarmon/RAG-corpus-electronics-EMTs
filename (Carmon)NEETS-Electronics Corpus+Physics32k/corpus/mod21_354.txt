A bolometer features a specially constructed element of temperature-sensitive material. The active 
material is a semiconductor bead supported between two pigtail leads. When rf power is applied to a 
bolometer element, the power absorption by the element heats the element and causes a change in its 
electrical resistance. Thus, a bolometer can be used in a bridge circuit so that small resistance changes can 
be easily detected and power measurement can be accomplished by the substitution method (that is, 
substitution of dc or low-frequency power to produce an equivalent heating effect). A D'Arsonval meter 
movement is usually employed as the null indicator.
