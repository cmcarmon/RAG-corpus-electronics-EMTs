If



(
X
,
ω
)


{\displaystyle (X,\omega )}
is a translation surface there is a natural measured foliation on



X


{\displaystyle X}
. If it is obtained from a polygon it is just the image of vertical lines, and the measure of an arc is just the euclidean length of the horizontal segment homotopic to the arc. The foliation is also obtained by the level lines of the imaginary part of a (local) primitive for



ω


{\displaystyle \omega }
and the measure is obtained by integrating the real part.
