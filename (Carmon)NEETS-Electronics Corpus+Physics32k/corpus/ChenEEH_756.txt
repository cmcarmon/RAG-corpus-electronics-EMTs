given in Figure 2.22, where array A cannot be stored in the
same single-port memory as any of the other arrays: it is in
conﬂict with them. However, there is no edge between B and
D, so these two arrays can be stored in one memory. Note that
to support multiport memories, this model must be extended
with hyperedges (Catthoor et al., 1998; Wuytack et al., 1996).
From the conﬂict graph, it is possible to estimate the cost of
the memory bandwidth required by the speciﬁed ordering
of the memory accesses. Three main components contribute
to the cost:
