A MOS device contains a thin layer of insulating glass that can easily be 
zapped away by 50 V of discharge or less. If you, your clothes, and your tools 
aren’t free of static discharge, that MOS field‐effect transistor (MOSFET) or 
complementary MOS (CMOS) IC you planned to use will be nothing more 
than a useless lump. Because bipolar transistors are constructed differently, 
they are less susceptible to ESD damage. Other components — resistors, 
capacitors, inductors, transformers, and diodes — don’t seem to be bothered 
by ESD.
