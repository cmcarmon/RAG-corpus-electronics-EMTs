An expedition by French astronomer A.C.D Crommelin observed lunar transits through the meridian (the moment when the Moon crosses an imaginary great circle that passes directly overhead and through the celestial poles) on the same night from two different locations. Careful measurements from 1905 through 1910 measured the angle of elevation at the moment when a specific lunar crater (Mösting A) crossed the meridian, from stations at Greenwich and at Cape of Good Hope, which share nearly the same longitude. A distance was calculated with an uncertainty of ± 30 km, and remained the definitive lunar distance value for the next half century.
