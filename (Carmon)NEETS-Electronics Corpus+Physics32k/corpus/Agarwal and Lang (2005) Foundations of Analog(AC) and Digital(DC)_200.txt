The v i relation is useful to describe other systems as well, not just primi-
tive two-terminal elements such as sources and resistors. When creating circuit
models for these systems,
it is often the case that an electronic circuit can
be abstracted as a black box accessible through a few terminals. As with any
abstraction, the details of behavior at the interfaces (terminals,
in our case)
are more important than the details of behavior internal to the black box.
That is, what happens at the terminals is more important than how it hap-
pens inside the black box. Furthermore, it is often the case that the terminals
can be paired into ports in a natural way following the function of the circuit.
For example, a complex amplifier or filter is often described by the relation
between an input signal presented to the amplifier or filter at one pair of ter-
minals or port, and an output signal presented by the amplifier or filter at
a second port. In this case, the terminal pairs or ports take on special sig-
nificance, and the voltage across the port and the current through the port
become the port variables in terms of which the electronic circuit behavior is
described.
