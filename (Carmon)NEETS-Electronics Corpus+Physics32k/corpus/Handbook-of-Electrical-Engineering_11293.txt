sensing  threshold  is  the  smallest  acceptable  amplitude  and  slew  rate  of  a  sensed  cardiac  signal.  Electrode
repositioning may be required if efﬁcient pacing and sensing are not realized. The leads are then connected to
the pacemaker, sutured in place to prevent signiﬁcant pacemaker movement, and the pocket is closed. Pacemaker
programming can be accomplished through a wireless telemetry system.
