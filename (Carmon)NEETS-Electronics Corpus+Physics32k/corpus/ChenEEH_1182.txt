Signal encoding schemes have been proposed to minimize
transition activities on busses while ignoring crosscoupled
capacitances. When statistical properties are unknown a
priori, the bus-invert method (Stan and Burleson, 1995) and
the on-line adaptive scheme (Benini et al., 1999) can be ap-
plied to encode randomly distributed signals. On the other
hand, highly correlated access patterns exhibit a spatiotem-
poral
locality that can be exploited for energy reduction
(Panda and Dutt, 1996) in Gray code (Mehta et al., 1996; Su
et al., 1994), the TO method (Benini et al., 1997), the working-
zone encoding (Musoll et al., 1998), the combined bus-invert/
TO (Benini et al., 1998), and the coupling-driven method
(Kim et al., 2000). Lower bounds for minimum achievable
transition activity have been derived for noiseless busses in
(Ramprasad et al., 1999) and for noisy busses in Hegde and
Shanbhag (1998). In Zhang et al., (1998), a segmentation
method was introduced to reduce power consumption. Speci-
Ô¨Åcation transformation approaches have also been used to
reduce the number of memory accesses at the behavioral
level (Catthoor et al., 1994). The effectiveness of various en-
coding schemes was compared at the system level by Fornaciari
et al. (1999).
