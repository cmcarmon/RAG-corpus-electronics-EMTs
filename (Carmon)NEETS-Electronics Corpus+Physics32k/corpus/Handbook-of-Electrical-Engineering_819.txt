Theorem 12.3
Assume  that  the  Lyapunov  function  is  deﬁned  on  the  entire  state  space X, V(x(t))  is  strictly  decreasing  in  t
unless x(t) = x; furthermore, V(x) tends to inﬁnity as any component of x gets arbitrarily large in magnitude.
Then the equilibrium state is globally asymptotically stable.
