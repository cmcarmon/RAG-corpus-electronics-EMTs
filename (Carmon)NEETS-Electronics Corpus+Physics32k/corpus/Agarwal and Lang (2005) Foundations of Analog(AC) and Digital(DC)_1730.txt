If the damping factor α is small compared to ω◦, as is characteristic of an under-
damped circuit, then Q will be large, and the circuit will oscillate for a long
time near the frequency ω◦. For the series circuit, this is achieved with a small
R, that is, with the corresponding resistor near a short circuit. Alternatively, to
purposefully damp any oscillations and make them slower, one would make R
large.
