Linear network: A network in which the parameters of resistance, inductance, and capacitance are constant
with respect to voltage or current or the rate of change of voltage or current and in which the voltage
or  current  of  sources  is  either  independent  of  or  proportional  to  other  voltages  or  currents,  or  their
derivatives.
