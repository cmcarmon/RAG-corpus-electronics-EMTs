A 
 is a collection of applications hosted on different machines and inter-
connected by an infrastructure that provides communications among the communicating entities. While the
applications are generally understood to be computer programs, the generic model includes the human being
as an application. In fact, one or all of the “applications’’ that are communicating may be human beings.
