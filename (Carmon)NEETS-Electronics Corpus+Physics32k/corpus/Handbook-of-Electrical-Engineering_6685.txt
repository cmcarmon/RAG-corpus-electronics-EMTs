protocol data units
(PDUs)
, which contain all of the information required for the receiving protocol entity to provide the required
service. In order to exchange PDUs, entities at a given layer use the services of the next lower layer. The data
link primitives listed above include both connection-mode primitives and connectionless-mode primitives. For
connection-mode  communications,  a  connection  must  be  established  between  two  peer  entities  before  they
can exchange PDUs.
