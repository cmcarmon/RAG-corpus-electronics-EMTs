In astrodynamics, canonical units are defined in terms of an object's reference orbit. In this system, a reference mass, for example the sun, is assumed to be 1 "mass unit" and the mean distance from the orbiting object to the reference object is considered the "distance unit".
Canonical units are useful when the precise distances and masses of objects in space are not available. However, by setting the mass of a given object to be 1 mass unit and the mean distance of the reference object to another object in question, many calculations can be simplified.
