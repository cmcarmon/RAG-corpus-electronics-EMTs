The variety of commercially available MEMS and their appli-
cations have both increased dramatically in recent years. The
production of MEMS is now more than a 20-billion dollar
industry worldwide, with about 100 million devices marketed
annually. Although this industry grew out of the microelec-
tronics industry, it is more complex in many important ways.
Most fundamentally, it requires the integration of both micro-
electronics and micromechanics. Many MEMS involve several
closely coupled mechanisms, some of which behave differently
on the micrometer spatial scale than on familiar macroscopic
scales. This complicates both the design and simulation of
MEMS. Complications also arise from the much wider variety
of materials and processes used to make MEMS compared to
microelectronics. Because many MEMS have to be open to the
atmosphere, their packaging, calibration, and testing are all
