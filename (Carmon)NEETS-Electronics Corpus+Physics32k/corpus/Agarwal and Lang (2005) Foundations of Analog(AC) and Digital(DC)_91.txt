Lumped circuits comprise lumped elements (or discrete elements) con-
nected by ideal wires. A lumped element has the property that a unique terminal
voltage V(t) and terminal current I(t) can be defined for it. As depicted in
Figure 1.6, for a two-terminal element, V is the voltage across the terminals
of the element,6 and I is the current through the element.7 Furthermore, for
lumped resistive elements, we can define a single property called the resistance R
that relates the voltage across the terminals to the current through the terminals.
The voltage, the current, and the resistance are defined for an element
only under certain constraints that we collectively call the lumped matter dis-
cipline (LMD). Once we adhere to the lumped matter discipline, we can make
several simplifications in our circuit analysis and work with the lumped circuit
abstraction. Thus the lumped matter discipline provides the foundation for the
lumped circuit abstraction, and is the fundamental mechanism by which we are
able to move from the domain of physics to the domain of electrical engineer-
ing. We will simply state these constraints here, but relegate the development
of the constraints of the lumped matter discipline to Section A.1 in Appendix A.
Section A.2 further shows how the lumped matter discipline results in the sim-
plification of Maxwellâ€™s equations into the algebraic equations of the lumped
circuit abstraction.
