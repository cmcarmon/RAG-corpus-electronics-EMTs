1. Zero-current  switching  QRCs  [Sum,  1988;  Liu  et al.,  1985]. Figure 30.30(a)  shows  an  example  of  a
ZCS QR buck converter implemented using a ZC resonant switch. Depending on whether the resonant
switch  is  half-wave  type  or  full-wave  type,  the  resonating  current  will  be  only  half-wave  sinusoidal
[Fig. 30.30(b)]  or  a  full  sine-wave  [Fig. 30.30(c)].  The  device  currents  are  shaped  sinusoidally,  and,
therefore, the switching losses are almost negligible with low turn-on and turn-off stresses. ZCS QRCs
can operate at frequencies of the order of 2 MHz. The major problems with this type of converter are
high peak currents through the switch and capacitive turn-on losses.
