Combining the results: All that remains now is to determine which of the two
segments of operations apply when E = 3 V and when E = âˆ’5 V. A little bit of
intuition tells us that when E = 3 V, the short circuit segment applies. Notice
that both the resistor and the diode (a nonlinear resistor) do not produce power,
and so the direction of the current must be such that the voltage source delivers
power. In other words, when E is positive, so must iD. From Equation 4.34,
when iD is positive, the diode is ON. In this segment, from Equations 4.36
and 4.37
