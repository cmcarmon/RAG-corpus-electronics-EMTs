A better way is to input white noise W(t) in place of S(t) (a noise diode may be used). The disadvantages of
noise factors are (1) when the device has low noise relative to thermal noise, the noise factor has value close
to 1; (2) a low resistance causes high values; and (3) increasing the source resistance decreases the noise factor
while  increasing  the  total  noise  in  the  circuit  [Ott,  1988,  p.  216].  Thus,  accuracy  is  not  good.  For  cascaded
devices, the noise factors can be conveniently computed [see Buckingham, 1985, p. 67; or Ott, 1988, p. 228].
