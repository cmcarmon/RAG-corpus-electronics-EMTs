These three elements compose a SAW transducer equivalent circuit. The equivalent circuit, shown in Fig. 47.4,
is  composed  of  one  lumped  element  and  two  frequency-dependent  terms  which  are  related  to  the  substrate
material  parameters,  transducer  electrode  number,  and  the  transducer  conÔ¨Åguration.  Figure  47.5  shows  the
