To completely define angular momentum in three dimensions, it is required to know the angle swept out in unit time, the direction perpendicular to the instantaneous plane of angular displacement, and the sense (right- or left-handed) of the angular velocity, as well as the mass involved. By retaining this vector nature of angular momentum, the general nature of the equations is also retained, and can describe any sort of three-dimensional motion about the center of rotation – circular, linear, or otherwise. In vector notation, the angular momentum of a point particle in motion about the origin is defined as:





L

=
I

ω

,


{\displaystyle \mathbf {L} =I{\boldsymbol {\omega }},}
where




I
=

r

2


m


{\displaystyle I=r^{2}m}
is the moment of inertia for a point mass,





ω

=




r

×

v



r

2






{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\omega }}={\frac {\mathbf {r} \times \mathbf {v} }{r^{2}}}}
is the angular velocity of the particle about the origin,





r



{\displaystyle \mathbf {r} }
is the position vector of the particle relative to the origin,



r
=

|

r

|



{\displaystyle r=\left\vert \mathbf {r} \right\vert }
,





v



{\displaystyle \mathbf {v} }
is the linear velocity of the particle relative to the origin,

and



m


{\displaystyle m}
is the mass of the particle.

This can be expanded,




L

=
(

r

2


m
)

(




r

v



r

)

,


{\displaystyle \mathbf {L} =(r^{2}m)\left({\frac {\mathbf {r} \times \mathbf {v} }{r^{2}}}\right),}
reduced,




L

=
m
(

r

×

v

)
,


{\displaystyle \mathbf {L} =m(\mathbf {r} \times \mathbf {v} ),}
and by the rules of vector algebra rearranged to the form,









L




=

r

×
m

v







=

r

×

p

,






{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\mathbf {L} &=\mathbf {r} \times m\mathbf {v} \\&=\mathbf {r} \times \mathbf {p} ,\end{aligned}}}

which is the cross product of the position vector




r



{\displaystyle \mathbf {r} }
and the linear momentum




p

=
m

v



{\displaystyle \mathbf {p} =m\mathbf {v} }
of the particle. By the definition of the cross product, the




L



{\displaystyle \mathbf {L} }
vector is perpendicular to both




r



{\displaystyle \mathbf {r} }
and




p



{\displaystyle \mathbf {p} }
. It is directed perpendicular to the plane of angular displacement, as indicated by the right-hand rule – so that the angular velocity is seen as counter-clockwise from the head of the vector. Conversely, the




L



{\displaystyle \mathbf {L} }
vector defines the plane in which




r



{\displaystyle \mathbf {r} }
and




p



{\displaystyle \mathbf {p} }
lie.
By defining a unit vector






u
^





{\displaystyle \mathbf {\hat {u}} }
perpendicular to the plane of angular displacement, a scalar angular speed



ω


{\displaystyle \omega }
results, where




ω



u
^



=

ω

,


{\displaystyle \omega \mathbf {\hat {u}} ={\boldsymbol {\omega }},}
and




ω
=



v

⊥


r


,


{\displaystyle \omega ={\frac {v_{\perp }}{r}},}
where




v

⊥




{\displaystyle v_{\perp }}
is the perpendicular component of the motion, as above.
The two-dimensional scalar equations of the previous section can thus be given direction:

and
