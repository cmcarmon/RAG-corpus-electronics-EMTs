In astronomy, the Goldreich-Kylafis (GK) effect causes certain molecular line emission to be weakly linearly polarized, e.g., in the presence of a magnetic field. Compared to polarized dust emission, the GK effect has the potential to yield additional information along the line of sight through its dependence on velocity in the line profile.
