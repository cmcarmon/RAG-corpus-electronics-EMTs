15.3.2 If an analog message that has a spectral extent of
15 kHz is sampled at three times the Nyquist rate,
determine the sampling rate.
15.3.3 The quantum levels of a quantizer are separated
by the step size δv = 0.2 V, with the lowest and
highest levels of −3.3 V and +3.3 V, respectively.
A sequence of message samples is given by−2.15
V, −0.53 V, 0.95 V, 0.17 V, and −0.76 V.
(a) List the quantum levels.
