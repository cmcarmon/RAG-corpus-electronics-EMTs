The v is the input to the action node, and gi and hi are the
output and the input of the hidden nodes of the action net-
work, respectively. Since the action network inputs the state
measurements only, there is no (n Ã¾ 1)th term in equation
13.23 as in the critic network (see equation 13.14 for compari-
son). The update rule for the nonlinear multilayer action
network also contains two sets of equations:
