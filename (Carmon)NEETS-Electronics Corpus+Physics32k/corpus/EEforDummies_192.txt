the  worst-case  scenario  —  the  maximum 
 combination of voltage times current that your 
component will face during circuit operation — 
to determine how many watts that component 
should be able to handle. Then, give yourself 
some breathing room by selecting a component 
with a power rating that exceeds your maximum 
power estimate.
