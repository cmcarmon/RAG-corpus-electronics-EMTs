OFCC cables are easy to handle because each cable contains its own subcable, the OFCC. These
OFCC subcables make it easy to reconfigure systems and handle individual fibers. Rugged OFCC cable
design permits cable use in harsh environments, including Navy applications. OFCC-type cable is
recommended for use in low-density (less than 24 fibers) Navy applications. OFCC-type cable is also
being evaluated for use in Navy applications with fiber counts up to 36 fibers.
