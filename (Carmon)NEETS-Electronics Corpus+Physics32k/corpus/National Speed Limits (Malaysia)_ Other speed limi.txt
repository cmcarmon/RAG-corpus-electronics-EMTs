For school areas, the speed limit of 35 km/h (22 mph) is applicable during rush hours. Besides, cars with trailers apply the same speed limit as heavier vehicles (80 km/h (50 mph) on expressways and 80 km/h (50 mph) on other roads).
Starting from the 2006 Hari Raya Aidilfitri, the Malaysian Police began enforcing lower speed limits during festive seasons for all federal and state roads, from the default 90 km/h (56 mph) down to 80 km/h (50 mph).
