The steady-state errors to step position commands for the system shown in Fig. 101.12 are zero. However,
in  the  presence  of  disturbances  such  as  external  load  torques  or gravitational torques,  the  system  will  have
steady-state errors. For example, if TL is the load torque as shown in Fig. 101.12, the available torque for the
joint motion is given by
