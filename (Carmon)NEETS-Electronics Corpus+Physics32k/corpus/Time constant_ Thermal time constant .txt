Time constants are a feature of the lumped system analysis (lumped capacity analysis method) for thermal systems, used when objects cool or warm uniformly under the influence of convective cooling or warming. In this case, the heat transfer from the body to the ambient at a given time is proportional to the temperature difference between the body and the ambient:




F

h

A

(

T

)

,


{\displaystyle F=hA_{s}\left(T(t)-T_{a}\right),}

where h is the heat transfer coefficient, and As is the surface area, T(t) = body temperature at time t, and Ta is the constant ambient temperature. The positive sign indicates the convention that F is positive when heat is leaving the body because its temperature is higher than the ambient temperature (F is an outward flux). If heat is lost to the ambient, this heat transfer leads to a drop in temperature of the body given by:




ρ

p


V



d

d

F
,


{\displaystyle \rho c_{p}V{\frac {dT}{dt}}=-F,}

where ρ = density, cp = specific heat and V is the body volume. The negative sign indicates the temperature drops when the heat transfer is outward from the body (that is, when F > 0). Equating these two expressions for the heat transfer,

{\displaystyle \rho c_{p}V{\frac {dT}{dt}}=-hA_{s}\left(T(t)-T_{a}\right).}

Evidently, this is a first-order LTI system that can be cast in the form:

with

{\displaystyle \tau ={\frac {\rho c_{p}V}{hA_{s}}}.}

In other words, the time constant says that larger masses ρV and larger heat capacities cp lead to slower changes in temperature, while larger surface areas As and better heat transfer h lead to faster temperature changes.
Comparison with the introductory differential equation suggests the possible generalization to time-varying ambient temperatures Ta. However, retaining the simple constant ambient example, by substituting the variable ΔT ≡ (T − Ta), one finds:

Systems for which cooling satisfies the above exponential equation are said to satisfy Newton's law of cooling. The solution to this equation suggests that, in such systems, the difference between the temperature of the system and its surroundings ΔT as a function of time t, is given by:

{\displaystyle \Delta T(t)=\Delta T_{0}e^{-t/\tau },}

where ΔT0 is the initial temperature difference, at time t= 0. In words, the body assumes the same temperature as the ambient at an exponentially slow rate determined by the time constant.
