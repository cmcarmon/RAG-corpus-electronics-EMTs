This transient is shown in Figure 12.40. Again we see that the transient rings, although
with greater damping due to an increase in RTH. With this ringing behavior, the output
is not valid until all oscillations remain above the VOH threshold. The corresponding
tpd,1â†’0 is depicted in Figure 12.40.
