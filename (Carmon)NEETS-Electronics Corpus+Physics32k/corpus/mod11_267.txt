The use of microwave frequencies forced the development of special tubes to offset the limitations 
caused by interelectrode capacitance, lead inductance, and electron transit-time effects in conventional 
tubes. Microwave tubes, such as the klystron and twt, take advantage of transit-time effects through the 
use of VELOCITY MODULATION to amplify and generate microwave energy.
