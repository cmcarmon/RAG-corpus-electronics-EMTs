Dependent current sources are used to create the main gain elements. Because these sources force current
 resistor, the voltage gain is Gm*R at low frequency. In the differential mode this gives (GDIF*R1 =
into a 1-
100). In the common mode this gives (GCM*R1*(RCM/(RDIF1 + RCM = 0.0909). The two diodes D1 and
D2  implement  clipping  by  preventing  the  voltage  at  node  6  from  exceeding VCC  or  going  below VEE.  The
