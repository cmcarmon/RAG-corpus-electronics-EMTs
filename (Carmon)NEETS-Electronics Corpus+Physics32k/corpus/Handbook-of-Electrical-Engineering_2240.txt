The ﬁrst term in Eq. (22.13) describes the so-called Landau levels, while the second corresponds to the kinetic
energy of motion along the magnetic ﬁeld B = Bz. In a pseudo-two-dimensional system like the channel of a
ﬁeld-effect transistor the second term in Eq. (22.13) does not appear, since the motion of electrons occurs in
the plane perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld.1 In such a structure the electron density of states (number of
allowed quantum states per unit energy interval) is peaked at the Landau level. Since wc } B, the positions of
these peaks relative to the Fermi level are controlled by the magnetic ﬁeld.
