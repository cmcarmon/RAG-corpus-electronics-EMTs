Definition 1: A system mapping



x


{\displaystyle x}
to



y


{\displaystyle y}
is causal if and only if, for any pair of input signals




x

1


(
t
)


{\displaystyle x_{1}(t)}
and




x

2


(
t
)


{\displaystyle x_{2}(t)}
such that





x

1


(
t
)
=

x

2


(
t
)
,

∀

t
≤

t

0


,


{\displaystyle x_{1}(t)=x_{2}(t),\quad \forall \ t\leq t_{0},}

the corresponding outputs satisfy





y

1


(
t
)
=

y

2


(
t
)
,

∀

t
≤

t

0


.


{\displaystyle y_{1}(t)=y_{2}(t),\quad \forall \ t\leq t_{0}.}

Definition 2: Suppose



h
(
t
)


{\displaystyle h(t)}
is the impulse response of the system



H


{\displaystyle H}
. (only fully accurate for a system described by linear constant coefficient differential equation). The system



H


{\displaystyle H}
is causal if and only if




h
(
t
)
=
0
,

∀

t
<
0


{\displaystyle h(t)=0,\quad \forall \ t<0}

otherwise it is non-causal.
