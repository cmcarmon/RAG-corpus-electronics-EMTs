Magnetism is generally defined as that property of a material which enables it to attract pieces of
iron. A material possessing this property is known as a MAGNET. The word originated with the ancient
Greeks, who found stones possessing this characteristic. Materials that are attracted by a magnet, such as
iron, steel, nickel, and cobalt, have the ability to become magnetized. These are called magnetic materials.
