The node method begins by ﬁnding all nodes–places where circuit elements attach to each other–in the
circuit. We call one of the nodes the reference node; the choice of reference node is arbitrary, but it is
usually chosen to be a point of symmetry or the “bottom” node. For the remaining nodes, we deﬁne node
voltages en that represent the voltage between the node and the reference. These node voltages constitute
the only unknowns; all we need is a suﬃcient number of equations to solve for them. In our example, we
have two node voltages. The very act of deﬁning node voltages is equivalent to using all the KVL
equations at your disposal. The reason for this simple, but astounding, fact is that a node voltage is
uniquely deﬁned regardless of what path is traced between the node and the reference. Because two paths
between a node and reference have the same voltage, the sum of voltages around the loop equals zero.
