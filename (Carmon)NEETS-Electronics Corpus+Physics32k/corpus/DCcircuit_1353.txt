Just as Isaac Newton’s ﬁrst Law of Motion (”an object in motion tends to stay in motion;
an object at rest tends to stay at rest”) describes the tendency of a mass to oppose changes in
velocity, we can state an inductor’s tendency to oppose changes in current as such: ”Electrons
moving through an inductor tend to stay in motion; electrons at rest in an inductor tend to
stay at rest.” Hypothetically, an inductor left short-circuited will maintain a constant rate of
current through it with no external assistance:
