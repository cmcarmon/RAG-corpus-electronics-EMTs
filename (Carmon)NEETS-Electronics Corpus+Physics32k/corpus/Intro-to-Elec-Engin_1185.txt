Single-phase reluctance motors Ô¨Ånd application in such devices as clocks, electric shavers,
electric clippers, vibrators, sandpapering machines, and engraving tools. A hysteresis motor is
employed for driving high-quality record players and tape recorders, electric clocks, and other
timing devices. The horsepower range is up to 1 hp for hysteresis motors, and up to 100 hp for
reluctance motors.
