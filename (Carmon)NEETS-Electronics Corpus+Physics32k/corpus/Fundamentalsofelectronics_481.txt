Problem 4.9: Spectra of Digital Communication Signals
One way to represent bits with signals is shown in Figure 4.25. If the value of a bit is a “1,” it is represented
by a positive pulse of duration T . If it is a “0,” it is represented by a negative pulse of the same duration.
To represent a sequence of bits, the appropriately chosen pulses are placed one after the other.
