Thus, for a balanced wye-connected load, the neutral current is always zero. The line currents
√
and phase currents are equal in magnitude, and the line currents are in phase with the corresponding
3 times the phase voltages, and the
phase currents. The line-to-line voltages, in magnitude, are
phase voltages lag the corresponding line voltages by 30°.
