The individual bits would have dimensions and spacings of a
few molecular diameters. This nascent technology has been
called nanocuneiform after the production of marks in clay
tablets by people in Mesopotamia (at about 10 bits=cm2).
Methods for erasing bits are contemplated, so the MEMS data
storage devices would be comparable in behavior to current
magnetic media. This approach to data storage is being pursued
by IBM and a few other companies. The initial MEMS data
storage products would offer densities near 30 Gbits=cm2. It is
interesting that while an entirely new MEMS technology is
being developed to displace disk drives, MEMS actuators
could be incorporated into the arms in magnetic drives to give
Ô¨Åner control of the read/write heads, which decreases the track
spacing and increases storage density.
