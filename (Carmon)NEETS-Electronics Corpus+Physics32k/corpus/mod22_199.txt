Dot-matrix printers, (also known as the wire matrix printers) create characters in much the same way 
you see numbers on the scoreboard at a baseball or football game. In contrast to the daisy-wheel printers, 
dot-matrix printers use an arrangement of tiny pins or hammers, called a dot matrix, to generate characters 
a dot-at-a-time. A dot-matrix print head builds characters out of the dots created by the pins in the matrix. 
Figure 2-25, view A, shows what dot matrix characters look like when printed.
