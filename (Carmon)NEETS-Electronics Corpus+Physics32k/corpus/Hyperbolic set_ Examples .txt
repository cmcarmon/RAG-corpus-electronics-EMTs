Hyperbolic equilibrium point p is a fixed point, or equilibrium point, of f, such that (Df)p has no eigenvalue with absolute value 1. In this case, Î› = {p}.
More generally, a periodic orbit of f with period n is hyperbolic if and only if Dfn at any point of the orbit has no eigenvalue with absolute value 1, and it is enough to check this condition at a single point of the orbit.
