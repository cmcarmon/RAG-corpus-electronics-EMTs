Suppose R(t) is called the scale factor of the Universe, and increases as the Universe expands in a manner that depends upon the cosmological model selected. Its meaning is that all measured proper distances D(t) between co-moving points increase proportionally to R. (The co-moving points are not moving relative to each other except as a result of the expansion of space.) In other words:







D
(
t
)


D

=



R

R
(

t

)




,


{\displaystyle {\frac {D(t)}{D(t_{0})}}={\frac {R(t)}{R(t_{0})}}\ ,}

where t0 is some reference time. If light is emitted from a galaxy at time te and received by us at t0, it is red shifted due to the expansion of space, and this redshift z is simply:




z
=

R

.


{\displaystyle z={\frac {R(t_{0})}{R(t_{e})}}-1\ .}

Suppose a galaxy is at distance D, and this distance changes with time at a rate dtD . We call this rate of recession the "recession velocity" vr:





v

r


=

d

D
=




d

R

{\displaystyle v_{r}=d_{t}D={\frac {d_{t}R}{R}}D\ .}

We now define the Hubble constant as




H
≡




d

t


R

R



,


{\displaystyle H\equiv {\frac {d_{t}R}{R}}\ ,}

and discover the Hubble law:





v

r


=
H
D

.


{\displaystyle v_{r}=HD\ .}

From this perspective, Hubble's law is a fundamental relation between (i) the recessional velocity contributed by the expansion of space and (ii) the distance to an object; the connection between redshift and distance is a crutch used to connect Hubble's law with observations. This law can be related to redshift z approximately by making a Taylor series expansion:




z

,


{\displaystyle z={\frac {R(t_{0})}{R(t_{e})}}-1\approx {\frac {R(t_{0})}{R(t_{0})\left(1+(t_{e}-t_{0})H(t_{0})\right)}}-1\approx (t_{0}-t_{e})H(t_{0})\ ,}

If the distance is not too large, all other complications of the model become small corrections and the time interval is simply the distance divided by the speed of light:




z

H

{\displaystyle z\approx (t_{0}-t_{e})H(t_{0})\approx {\frac {D}{c}}H(t_{0})\ ,}
or

.


{\displaystyle cz\approx DH(t_{0})=v_{r}\ .}

According to this approach, the relation cz = vr is an approximation valid at low redshifts, to be replaced by a relation at large redshifts that is model-dependent. See velocity-redshift figure.
