In thermodynamics and fluid mechanics, stagnation temperature is the temperature at a stagnation point in a fluid flow. At a stagnation point the speed of the fluid is zero and all of the kinetic energy has been converted to internal energy and is added to the local static enthalpy. In incompressible fluid flow, and in compressible flow, the stagnation temperature is equal to the total temperature at all points on the streamline leading to the stagnation point. See gas dynamics.
