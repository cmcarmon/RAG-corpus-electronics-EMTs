addition to the information on Bode diagrams, there are about a dozen rules that can be used to help construct
Nyquist diagrams, and (2) Nyquist diagrams handle bizarre systems better, as is shown in the following rigorous
statement  of  the  Nyquist  stability  criterion.  The  number  of  clockwise  encirclements  minus  the  number  of
counterclockwise encirclements of the point s = â€“1 + j 0 by the Nyquist plot of KG(s)H(s) is equal to the number
of poles of Y(s)/U(s) minus the number of poles of KG(s)H(s) in the right half of the s-plane.
