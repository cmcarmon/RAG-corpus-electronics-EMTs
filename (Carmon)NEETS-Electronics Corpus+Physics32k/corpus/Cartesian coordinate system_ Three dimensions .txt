Choosing a Cartesian coordinate system for a three-dimensional space means choosing an ordered triplet of lines (axes) that are pair-wise perpendicular, have a single unit of length for all three axes and have an orientation for each axis. As in the two-dimensional case, each axis becomes a number line. The coordinates of a point P are obtained by drawing a line through P perpendicular to each coordinate axis, and reading the points where these lines meet the axes as three numbers of these number lines.
Alternatively, the coordinates of a point P can also be taken as the (signed) distances from P to the three planes defined by the three axes. If the axes are named x, y, and z, then the x-coordinate is the distance from the plane defined by the y- and z-axes. The distance is to be taken with the + or âˆ’ sign, depending on which of the two half-spaces separated by that plane contains P. The y- and z-coordinates can be obtained in the same way from the xz- and xy-planes respectively.
