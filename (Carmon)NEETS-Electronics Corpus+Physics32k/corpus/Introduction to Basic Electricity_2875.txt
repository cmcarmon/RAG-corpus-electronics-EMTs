An isolation	transformer	is used to isolate elec-
tronic equipment from 120-volts AC, 60-hertz power 
while it is being tested (Figure 27-7). The reason for 
using a transformer is to prevent shocks. Without the 
transformer, one side of the power source is connected 
to the chassis. When the chassis is removed from the 
cabinet, the “hot” chassis presents a shock hazard. This 
condition is more likely to occur if the power cord 
can be plugged in either way. A transformer prevents
