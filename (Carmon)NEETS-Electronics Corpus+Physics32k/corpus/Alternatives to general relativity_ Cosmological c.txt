The cosmological constant



Λ



{\displaystyle \Lambda \;}
is a very old idea, going back to Einstein in 1917. The success of the Friedmann model of the universe in which



Λ
=
0



{\displaystyle \Lambda =0\;}
led to the general acceptance that it is zero, but the use of a non-zero value came back with a vengeance when data from supernovae indicated that the expansion of the universe is accelerating
First, let's see how it influences the equations of Newtonian gravity and General Relativity.
In Newtonian gravity, the addition of the cosmological constant changes the Newton-Poisson equation from:

ϕ

G

{\displaystyle \nabla ^{2}\phi =4\pi \rho \ G;}

to

{\displaystyle \nabla ^{2}\phi +{\frac {1}{2}}\Lambda c^{2}=4\pi \rho \ G;}

In GR, it changes the Einstein–Hilbert action from

In alternative theories of gravity, a cosmological constant can be added to the action in exactly the same way.
The cosmological constant is not the only way to get an accelerated expansion of the universe in alternatives to GR. We've already seen how the scalar potential



λ
(
ϕ
)



{\displaystyle \lambda (\phi )\;}
can be added to scalar tensor theories. This can also be done in every alternative the GR that contains a scalar field



ϕ



{\displaystyle \phi \;}
by adding the term



λ
(
ϕ
)



{\displaystyle \lambda (\phi )\;}
inside the Lagrangian for the gravitational part of the action, the




L

ϕ





{\displaystyle L_{\phi }\;}
part of




S

{\displaystyle S={1 \over 16\pi G}\int d^{4}x\,{\sqrt {-g}}L_{\phi }+S_{m}\;}

Because



λ
(
ϕ
)



{\displaystyle \lambda (\phi )\;}
is an arbitrary function of the scalar field, it can be set to give an acceleration that is large in the early universe and small at the present epoch. This is known as quintessence.
A similar method can be used in alternatives to GR that use vector fields, including Rastall (1979) and vector-tensor theories. A term proportional to

{\displaystyle K^{\mu }K^{\nu }g_{\mu \nu }\;}
