The schematic for a typical series voltage regulator is shown in figure 4-34. Notice that this regulator 
has a transistor (Q1) in the place of the variable resistor found in figure 4-32. Because the total load 
current passes through this transistor, it is sometimes called a "pass transistor." Other components which 
make up the circuit are the current limiting resistor (R1) and the Zener diode (CR1).
