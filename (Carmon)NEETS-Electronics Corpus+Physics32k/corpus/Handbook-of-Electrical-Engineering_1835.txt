Routine generalizations to 3-D spatial arrays are also possible. The array pattern functions for other geometrical
distributions may also be routinely generated. For example, if unit weight sensors are located at the six vertices
and the center of a regular hexagon, each of whose sides is D units long, then the array pattern function can
be shown to be
