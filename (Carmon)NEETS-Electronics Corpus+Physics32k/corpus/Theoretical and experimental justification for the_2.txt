First consider the rest frame of the particle. In that case the frequency and wavenumber of the wave are related to the energy and momentum of the particles properties by





E

0


=
m

c

2


=
ℏ

ω

0




{\displaystyle E_{0}=mc^{2}=\hbar \omega _{0}}

and





p

0


=
0
=
ℏ

k

0




{\displaystyle p_{0}=0=\hbar k_{0}}

where m is the rest mass of the particle.
This describes a wave of infinite wavelength and infinite phase velocity

ω

k

{\displaystyle v_{\phi }={\omega _{0} \over k_{0}}}
.
The wave may be written as proportional to

{\displaystyle \cos(\omega _{0}^{}t)}
.
This, however, is also the solution for a simple harmonic oscillator, which can be thought of as a clock in the rest frame of the particle. We can imagine a clock ticking at the same frequency as the wave is oscillating. The phases of the wave and the clock can be synchronized.
