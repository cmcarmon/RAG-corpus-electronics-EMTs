Treatment of the equations of gaseous behaviour at rest is generally taken, as in hydrostatics, to begin with a consideration of the general equations of momentum for fluid flow, which can be expressed as:




ρ

,
where



ρ


{\displaystyle \rho }
is the mass density of the fluid,




U

j




{\displaystyle U_{j}}
is the instantaneous velocity,



P


{\displaystyle P}
is fluid pressure,



g


{\displaystyle g}
are the external body forces acting on the fluid, and




τ

i
j




{\displaystyle \tau _{ij}}
is the momentum transport coefficient. As the fluid's static nature mandates that




U

j


=
0


{\displaystyle U_{j}=0}
, and that




τ

i
j


=
0


{\displaystyle \tau _{ij}=0}
, the following set of partial differential equations representing the basic equations of aerostatics is found.

P

g

{\displaystyle {\partial P \over \partial x_{j}}=\rho g_{j}}

However, the presence of a non-constant density as is found in gaseous fluid systems (due to the compressibility of gases) requires the inclusion of the ideal gas law:






P
ρ


=
R
T


{\displaystyle {P \over \rho }=RT}
,
where



R


{\displaystyle R}
denotes the universal gas constant, and



T


{\displaystyle T}
the temperature of the gas, in order to render the valid aerostatic partial differential equations:

{\displaystyle {\partial P \over \partial x_{j}}=\rho {\hat {g_{j}}}={P \over \ RT}{\hat {g_{j}}}}
,
which can be employed to compute the pressure distribution in gases whose thermodynamic states are given by the equation of state for ideal gases.
