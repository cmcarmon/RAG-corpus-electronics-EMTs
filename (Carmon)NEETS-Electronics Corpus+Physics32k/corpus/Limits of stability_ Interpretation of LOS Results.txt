The capability of moving around without falling is necessary for activities of daily living (ADL's) . Patients exhibiting delay in the reaction time, decreased movement velocity, restricted LoS boundary or cone of stability, or uncontrolled CoG movement are at a higher risk of falling. A delayed reaction time suggests that the individual might have problems in cognitive processing. Reduced movement velocities are indicate high-level of central nervous system deficits. Reduced Endpoint excursions, excessively larger maximum excursions and poor directional control are all indicative of motor control abnormalities.
A LOS scores close to 100 represents no sway and hence reduced risk of fall, while scores close to 0 imply a higher risk of falling.
