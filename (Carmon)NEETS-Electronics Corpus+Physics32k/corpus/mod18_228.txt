In the sine-wave oscillator synchronizer (figure 2-2, view A), a sine-wave oscillator is used for the
basic timing device (master oscillator). The oscillator output is applied to both an overdriven amplifier
and the radar indicator. The sine waves applied to the overdriven amplifier are shaped into square waves.
These square waves are then converted into positive and negative timing trigger pulses by means of a
short-time-constant RC differentiator.
