The purpose of The Electrical Engineering Handbook is to
provide a comprehensive reference work covering the broad
spectrum of electrical engineering in a single volume. It is
written and developed for the practicing electrical engineers
in industry, government, and academia. The goal is to provide
the most up-to-date information in classical ﬁelds of circuits,
electronics, electromagnetics, electric power systems, and con-
trol systems, while covering the emerging ﬁelds of VLSI
systems, digital systems, computer engineering, computer-
aided design and optimization techniques, signal processing,
digital communications, and communication networks. This
handbook is not an all-encompassing digest of everything
taught within an electrical engineering curriculum. Rather, it
is the engineer’s ﬁrst choice in looking for a solution. There-
fore, full references to other sources of contributions are pro-
vided. The ideal reader is a B.S. level engineer with a need for a
one-source reference to keep abreast of new techniques and
procedures as well as review standard practices.
