Tether satellites might be used for various purposes, including research into tether propulsion, tidal stabilization and orbital plasma dynamics. Five main techniques for employing space tethers are in development:
Electrodynamic tethers
Electrodynamic tethers are primarily used for propulsion. These are conducting tethers that carry a current that can generate either thrust or drag from a planetary magnetic field, in much the same way as an electric motor does.
Momentum exchange tethers
These can be either rotating tethers, or non-rotating tethers, that capture an arriving spacecraft and then release it at a later time into a different orbit with a different velocity. Momentum exchange tethers can be used for orbital maneuvering, or as part of a planetary-surface-to-orbit / orbit-to-escape-velocity space transportation system.
Tethered formation flying
This is typically a non-conductive tether that accurately maintains a set distance between multiple space vehicles flying in formation.
Electric sail
A form of solar wind sail with electrically charged tethers that will be pushed by the momentum of solar wind ions.
Universal Orbital Support System
A concept for suspending an object from a tether orbiting in space.
Many uses for space tethers have been proposed, including deployment as space elevators, as skyhooks, and for doing propellant-free orbital transfers.
