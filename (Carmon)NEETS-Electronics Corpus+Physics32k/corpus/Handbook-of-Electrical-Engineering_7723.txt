The  second  component  of  service  time  is  rotational latency.  It  takes  some  time  for  the  desired  sector  to
rotate under the head position before it can be read or written. Today’s devices spin at a rate of approximately
3600  rpm,  or  60  revolutions  per  second  (we  expect  to  see  rotation  speeds  increase  to  5400  rpm  in  the  near
future). For today’s disks, a full revolution is 16 ms, and the average latency is 8 ms. Note that the worst-case
latencies are comparable to average seeks.
