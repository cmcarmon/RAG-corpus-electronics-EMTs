Radar systems may be classified as either SELF-SYNCHRONIZED or EXTERNALLY
SYNCHRONIZED systems. In a self-synchronized system, the timing trigger pulses are generated in the
transmitter. In an externally synchronized system, the timing trigger pulses are generated by a MASTER
OSCILLATOR, which is usually external to the transmitter.
