Gravitational waves originating from the inspiral phase of compact binary systems, such as neutron stars or black holes, have the useful property that both the amplitude and shape of the emitted gravitational radiation depend strongly on the chirp mass of the system. By observing the waveform, the chirp mass can be computed, and thus the amplitude. Further, gravitational waves are not subject to extinction due to an absorbing intervening medium. (They are subject to gravitational lensing, however.) Thus, such a gravitational wave source is a "standard siren" of known loudness.
The ratio of the source and received amplitudes allows the distance to be computed. Therefore, a standard siren can be used as a distance indicator on a cosmic scale. When the collision can be observed optically as well (as in the case of a kilonova), the Doppler shift can be measured and the Hubble constant computed.
