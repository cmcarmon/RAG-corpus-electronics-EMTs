Starting with the ﬂux linkages given by Equations (12.4.22) and (12.4.23), one can develop
the volt–ampere equations for the stator and rotor circuits. While the voltage and torque equations
for the idealized elementary machine of Example 12.4.1 with a uniform air gap are now obtained
from the coupled-circuit viewpoint, these can also be formulated from the magnetic-ﬁeld viewpoint
based on the interaction of the magnetic ﬁelds of the stator and rotor windings in the air gap.
