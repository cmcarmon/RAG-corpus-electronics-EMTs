The Galilean symmetries can be uniquely written as the composition of a rotation, a translation and a uniform motion of spacetime. Let x represent a point in three-dimensional space, and t a point in one-dimensional time. A general point in spacetime is given by an ordered pair (x, t).
A uniform motion, with velocity v, is given by




(


x


,
t
)
↦
(

v


,
t
)
,


{\displaystyle ({\mathbf {x} },t)\mapsto ({\mathbf {x} }+t{\mathbf {v} },t),}

where v ∈ ℝ3. A translation is given by




(


x


,
t
)
↦
(

a


,

s
)
,


{\displaystyle ({\mathbf {x} },t)\mapsto ({\mathbf {x} }+{\mathbf {a} },t+s),}

where a ∈ ℝ3 and s ∈ ℝ. A rotation is given by




(


x


,
t
)
↦
(
G


x


,
t
)
,


{\displaystyle ({\mathbf {x} },t)\mapsto (G{\mathbf {x} },t),}

where G : ℝ3 → ℝ3 is an orthogonal transformation.
As a Lie group, the Galilean transformations span 10 dimensions, i.e., comprise 10 generators.
