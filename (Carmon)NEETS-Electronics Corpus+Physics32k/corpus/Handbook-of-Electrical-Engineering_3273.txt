Image Formation with a Lens
Many  applications  require  a  lens  to  focus  light  or  to  form  an  image  onto  a  detector.  A  well-corrected  lens
usually consists of a number of lens elements in a mount, and this can be treated as a black box system. The
characteristics of this lens are known as the cardinal points. Figure 31.4 shows how a lens is used to form an
image from an illuminated object.
