13.3.15 A three-phase, wye-connected, round-rotor, 220-
V, 60-Hz, synchronous motor, having a syn-
chronous reactance of 1.27  per phase and
negligible armature resistance, is connected in
parallel with a three-phase, wye-connected load
that takes a current of 50 A at 0.707 lagging
power factor and 220 V line-to-line. At a power
angle of 30Â°, the power developed by the motor is
33 kW. Determine the reactive kVA of the motor,
and the overall power factor of the motor and the
load.
