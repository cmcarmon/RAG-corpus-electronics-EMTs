We must emphasize that the only stator leads ever interchanged, for the purpose of reversing receiver 
rotation, are S1 and S3. S2 cannot be reversed with any other lead since it represents the electrical zero 
position of the synchro. As you know, the stator leads in a synchro are 120ยบ apart. Therefore, any change 
in the S2 lead causes a 120ยบ error in the synchro system and also reverses the direction of rotation.
