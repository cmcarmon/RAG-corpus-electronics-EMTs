NORMALIZED FREQUENCY.â€”Electromagnetic waves bound to an optical fiber are described
by the fiber's normalized frequency. The normalized frequency determines how many modes a fiber can
support. Normalized frequency is a dimensionless quantity. Normalized frequency is also related to the
fiber's cutoff wavelength. Normalized frequency (V) is defined as:
