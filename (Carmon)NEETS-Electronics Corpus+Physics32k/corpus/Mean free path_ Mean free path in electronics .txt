Electrical mobility, a value directly related to electrical conductivity, is:




μ

e
τ

m


=



e
d

v

F





,


{\displaystyle \mu ={\frac {e\tau }{m}}={\frac {ed}{mv_{F}}},}

where e is the charge,



τ


{\displaystyle \tau }
is the mean free time, m is the mass, d is the mean free path, and vF is the Fermi velocity of the charge carrier. The Fermi velocity can easily be derived from the Fermi energy via the non-relativistic kinetic energy equation. In thin films, however, the film thickness can be smaller than the predicted mean free path, making surface scattering much more noticeable, effectively increasing the resistivity.
