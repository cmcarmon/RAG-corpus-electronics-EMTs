A semiconductor LD's geometry is similar to an ELED with light-guiding regions surrounding the
active region. Optical feedback is established by making the front facet partially reflective. This chapter
provides no diagram detailing LD structures because they are similar to ELEDs in design. The rear facet
is typically coated with a reflective layer so that all of the light striking the facet is reflected back into the
active region. The front facet is typically left uncoated so that most of the light is emitted. By increasing
the drive current, the diode becomes a laser.
