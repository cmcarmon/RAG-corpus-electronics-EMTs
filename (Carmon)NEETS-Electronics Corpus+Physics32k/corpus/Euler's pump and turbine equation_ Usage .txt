Eulerâ€™s pump and turbine equations can be used to predict the impact of changing the impeller geometry on the head. Qualitative estimations can be made from the impeller geometry about the performance of the turbine/pump. For the design of an aero-engines and the designing of power plants, the equations assume prime significance. Thus for the design aspect of turbines and pumps, the Euler equations are extremely useful.
