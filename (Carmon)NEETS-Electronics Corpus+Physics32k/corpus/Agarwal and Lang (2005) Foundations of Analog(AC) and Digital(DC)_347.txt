tedious. Fortunately, as we shall see in Chapter 3, there are much less tedious
approaches to this analysis. However, in advance of that we can still simplify the
analysis by employing results taken solely from earlier sections of this chapter.
Specifically, Section 2.4 shows that we can employ the equivalence of parallel
and series resistors, and the behavior of current and voltage dividers, to develop
an intuitive and simple approach to solving many types of circuits.
