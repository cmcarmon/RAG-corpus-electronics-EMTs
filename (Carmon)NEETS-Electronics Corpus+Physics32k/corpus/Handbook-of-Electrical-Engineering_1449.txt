Speech recognition systems can be constrained along a number of dimensions in order to make the recog-
nition problem more tractable. Training the parameters of a recognizer to the speech of the user is one way of
reducing variability and, thus, increasing recognition accuracy. Recognizers are categorized as speaker-depen-
dent or speaker-independent, depending upon whether or not full training is required by each new user. Speaker-
adaptive systems adjust automatically to the voice of a new talker, either on the basis of a relatively small amount
of training data or on a continuing basis while the system is in use.
