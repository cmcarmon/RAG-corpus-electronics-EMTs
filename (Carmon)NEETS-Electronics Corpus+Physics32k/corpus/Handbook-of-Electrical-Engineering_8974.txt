These  devices  come  in  two  main  forms,  hand-held  and  page  scanners,  with  or  without  OCR  software  in
addition to the standard image-recognition software. A typical hand-held scanner is shown in Fig. 89.18 and
it  consists  of  a  light  source,  a  light-sensitive  device  such  as  a  charge-coupled  device  (CCD)  array,  and  the
electronics  to  actuate  the  elements  of  the  array  sequentially  under  software  control.  The  scanner  window  is
placed over the page, and is moved down or across the page so that the window covers as much of the page as
falls within the capability of the software. The light source is reﬂected from the page to the CCD and the charge
in the CCD is modiﬁed by the reﬂectivity of the printed material.
