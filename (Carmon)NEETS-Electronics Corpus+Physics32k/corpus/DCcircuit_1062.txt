Thus, in the circuit above, battery B1 and resistor R1 are seen as a Thevenin source to be
converted into a Norton source of 7 amps (28 volts / 4 Ω) in parallel with a 4 Ω resistor. The
rightmost branch will be converted into a 7 amp current source (7 volts / 1 Ω) and 1 Ω resistor
in parallel. The center branch, containing no voltage source at all, will be converted into a
Norton source of 0 amps in parallel with a 2 Ω resistor:
