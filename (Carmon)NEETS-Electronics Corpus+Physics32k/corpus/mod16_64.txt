MULTIPLE CALIBRATION INTERVALS.â€”Some instruments have components that require
calibration less frequently than the rest of the instrument. For example, the attenuator in a signal generator
may require calibration every 12 months, whereas the rest of the instrument parameters should be
calibrated every 4 months. Since the attenuator calibration is time consuming and may require unavailable
standards, use of the multiple-interval approach can save considerable time (man-hours) as well as permit
the more frequent calibration to be performed at a lower level laboratory.
