The action of slip rings and that of a commutator differ in only one way. The conducting coil
connected to the slip ring is always connected to the brush, regardless of the mechanical speed Ï‰m
of the rotor and the rotor position, but with the commutator, the conducting coil conducts current
only when it is physically under the commutator brush, i.e., when it is stationary with respect to
the commutator brush. This difference is illustrated in Figure 12.2.5.
