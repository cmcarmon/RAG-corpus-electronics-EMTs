Other Parameter Estimation Schemes
The Bayesian, minimax, and maximum likelihood estimation schemes described above make up the class of
parametric parameter estimation procedures. The common characteristic of those procedures is the availability
of some parametrically known stochastic process that generates the observation sequence  xn. When for every
given parameter value qm the stochastic process that generates xn is nonparametrically described, the nonpara-
metric estimation schemes arise. The latter schemes may evolve as the solutions of certain saddle-point games,
whose payoff function originates from the parametric maximum likelihood formalizations. It is assumed that,
in addition to the nonparametrically described data-generating process, the only assets available are a realization
xn from the underlying active process and the parameter space  %m. The qualitative robustness in parameter
estimation  corresponds  to  local  performance  stability  for  small  deviations  from  a  nominal,  parametrically
known, data-generating process.
