The  theory  of  ﬁlter  synthesis,  whether  active  or  passive,  involves  the  determination  of  a  suitable  circuit
topology and the computation of the circuit component values within the topology, such that a required network
response  is  obtained.  This  response  is  most  commonly  a  voltage  transfer  function  (VTF)  speciﬁed  in  the
frequency domain. Circuit analysis will allow the performance of a ﬁlter to be evaluated, and this can be done
by obtaining the VTF,
s
, the complex frequency variable. The
poles
 of a VTF correspond to the roots of its denominator polynomial. It was established early in the history
of  ﬁlter  theory  that  a  network  capable  of  yielding  complex-conjugate  transfer  function  (TF)  pole-pairs  is
required  to  achieve  high  selectivity.  A  highly  selective  network  is  one  that  gives  a  rapid  transition  between
passband and stopband regions of the frequency response. Figure 29.1(a) gives an example of a passive low-
pass LCR ladder network capable of producing a VTF with the necessary pole pattern.
