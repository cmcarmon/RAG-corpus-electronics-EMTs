The reliability as well as the performance of germanium gamma-ray detectors has also continued to improve,
although this is harder to quantify. Cryostats have been redesigned to reduce virtual and direct leaks, reduce
microphonics,  implement  modular  design,  and  improve  ruggedness.  Detector  makers  are  also  making  more
serious attempts to offer models with reduced backgrounds by judicious design changes and careful selection
of materials.
