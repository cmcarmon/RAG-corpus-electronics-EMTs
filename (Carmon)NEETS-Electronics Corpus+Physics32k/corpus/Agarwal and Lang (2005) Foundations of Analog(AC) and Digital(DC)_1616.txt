Suppose we have a square-wave signal input to the inverter representing
a sequence of alternating 1’s and 0’s. Let the time period of the square wave
be T. Therefore, the frequency of the square wave is f = 1/T. As depicted in
Figure 11.8, when the input voltage is low, the MOSFET is off, and the load
capacitor CL is charged up to VS by the power supply through the resistor RL.
As suggested in Figure 11.9, when the input signal is high, the MOSFET is on,
and the capacitor discharges through the on resistance of the MOSFET. After a
long time, the voltage on the load capacitor will reach the steady state value of
VSRON/(RON + RL). Assume that the period of the input square wave is long
enough for the capacitor to charge and discharge completely.
