Shown in Fig. 42.5 are transverse mode patterns for the
electric  ﬁeld  in  a  symmetrical  slab  waveguide.  These  are
graphical  illustrations  of  the  ﬁelds  given  by  Eqs. (42.11)
and  (42.12).  Note  that,  for TEm ,  the  ﬁeld  has  m  zeros  in
the ﬁlm, and the evanescent ﬁeld penetrates more deeply
into the upper and lower layers for high-order modes.
