ADDITIVEâ€”Any material in the coating of magnetic tape other than the oxide and binder
resins. (Examples: plasticizers (to soften an otherwise hard or brittle binder), lubricants (to
lower the coefficient of friction of an otherwise high-friction binder), fungicides (to prevent
fungus growth), dispersants (to uniformly distribute the oxide particles), and dyes.)
