IS-95 also initially employed an 8 Kbps speech coder developed by Qualcomm Inc., QCELP8. In order to evolve
to higher voice quality, the QCELP13 13 Kbps coder was introduced primarily for PCS applications. Both of these
codecs employ variable-rate coding, choosing from four different compression rates for each 20-ms frame. This
is done to enhance capacity, allowing individual users to occupy more of the channel when their voice activity
was high. However, the evolution to 13 Kbps resulted in weakened error-corrective coding. As a result, another
variable-rate 8 Kbps codec, EVRC, was introduced. This codec provides comparable voice quality to QCELP13 at
a lower rate. EVRC uses only three of the original four coding rates used by QCELP8 for each frame.
