Step 3—Developing the PC.  There are basically three development techniques: dual component, monocom-
ponent and liquid development. The ﬁrst two use powder toner. Until the advent of EP printers for personal
and workstation computers, the most common method of development was dual component, where polymer-
coated magnetic carrier beads are mixed with the toner particles and development is done with a “magnetic
brush.” This technique is still prevalent in high-end printers. With this approach, the 5–20 mm toner particles
(consisting mainly of resin plus carbon particles or colorant) are triboelectrically charged by repeated contacts
during mixing with the much larger (60–250 mm) magnetic carrier beads. The toner particles then electrostat-
ically adhere to the opposite-sign charged carrier beads. Charge control agents (e.g., complex organometallic
salts) are often included in the toner composition to control the charge level, rate of charging, and consistency
of charge. The mix is mechanically directed to a nonmagnetic rotating shell which has ﬁxed magnets located
within its core, adjacent to the gap between the PC and the shell (see Fig. 89.25). The gap is typically 0.5 to 6
mm,  depending  on  the  speciﬁc  system. As  the  shell  rotates,  the  mixture  is  carried  to  the  gap,  and  chains  of
carrier beads (coated with toner—the “magnetic brush”!) form along the local magnetic ﬁeld lines. These ﬁeld
lines  are  approximately  perpendicular  to  the  shell  at  the  smallest  gap.  In  addition,  a  development  voltage
(200–500 V)  is  applied  between  the  PC  and  shell.  This  provides  a  high  ﬁeld  in  the  gap  whose  local  value  is
determined by the applied voltage, gap dimension and the electrical properties of the material mix in the gap.
