The serape effect is a rotational trunk movement that involves ballistic motions, such as throwing or kicking. It stretches these muscles to their greatest length in order to create a snap-back effect. When this tension is released from these muscles they shorten for the completion of the movement, and a greater velocity is applied than had the muscles performed from a normal resting length.
