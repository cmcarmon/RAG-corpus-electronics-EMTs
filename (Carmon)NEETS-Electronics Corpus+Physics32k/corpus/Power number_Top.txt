For Newton number, see also Kissing number in the sphere packing problem.
The power number Np (also known as Newton number) is a commonly used dimensionless number relating the resistance force to the inertia force.
The power-number has different specifications according to the field of application. E.g., for stirrers the power number is defined as:





N


p



=


P

ρ

n

3



D

5







{\displaystyle N_{\mathrm {p} }={\frac {P}{\rho n^{3}D^{5}}}}

with
P: power
ρ: fluid density
n: rotational speed
D: diameter of stirrer
