Consider what happens along the QQ1 axis. Energy radiating from element M toward Q reaches 
element L in about 1/2 cycle (180 degrees) after it leaves its source. Since element L was fed 180 degrees 
out of phase with element M, the wavefronts are now in the same phase and are both moving toward Q 
reinforcing each other. Similar reinforcement occurs along the same axis toward Q1. This simultaneous 
movement towards Q and Q1 develops a bi-directional pattern. This is not always true in end-fire 
operation. Another application of the end-fire principle is one in which the elements are spaced 1/4 
wavelength apart and phased 90 degrees from each other to produce a unidirectional pattern.
