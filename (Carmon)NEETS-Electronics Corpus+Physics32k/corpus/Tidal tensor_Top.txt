In Newton's theory of gravitation and in various relativistic classical theories of gravitation, such as general relativity, the tidal tensor represents
tidal accelerations of a cloud of (electrically neutral, nonspinning) test particles,
tidal stresses in a small object immersed in an ambient gravitational field.
