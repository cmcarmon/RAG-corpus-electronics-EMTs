We consider all these techniques to be old fashioned. They were developed to help answer the question of
stability  without  factoring  the  characteristic  polynomial.  However,  many  computer  programs  are  currently
available that factor polynomials. We recommend that engineers merely buy one of these computer packages
and Ô¨Ånd the roots of the closed-loop transfer function to assess the stability of a system.
