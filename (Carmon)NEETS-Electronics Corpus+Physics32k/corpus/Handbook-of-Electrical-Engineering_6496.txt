CDV  can  be  transmitted  using  time-division  multi-
plexing (TDM) and digital lightwave systems or by using
each channel to modulate an RF carrier and transmitting
using  analog  lightwave  systems.  There  are  numerous
applications for both alternatives. TDM systems for CDV
are no different from any other digital transmission sys-
tem and will not be discussed further.
