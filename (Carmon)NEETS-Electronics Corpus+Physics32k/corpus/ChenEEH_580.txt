cross-section of a vertical n-channel power MOSFET. The
MOSFET is a voltage-controlled device as opposed to a BJT
that is a current-controlled device. In an off-state mode, the
depletion layer expands in the drift region and supports the
blocking voltage. As the depletion layer grows, it pinches off
the region between the p-wells and isolates the gate oxide from
the high voltage appearing at the drain. The channel region is
formed by implantation and diffusion of p-type impurities in
the window for the source region. The p-type region also
isolates the source and the drain. Application of a gate voltage
higher than a threshold value creates an inversion channel
under the gate oxide that supports current ï¬‚ow from source
to the drain. For an ideal metal-oxide-semiconductor struc-
ture, the threshold voltage is expressed as:
