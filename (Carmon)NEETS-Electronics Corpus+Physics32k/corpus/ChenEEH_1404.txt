The group led by Woods has developed an efﬁcient tech-
nique for fast partial reconﬁguration for FPGA-based systems
(Sezer et al., 1998). They used a library-based approach to
achieve a high degree of commonality between designs. The
conﬁguration data are stored efﬁciently in a conﬁguration
data graph (CDG). A CDG is a database of designs organized
according to their shared components. High-speed conﬁgu-
ration is also achieved by using reconﬁguration state graphs
(RSGs) that model reconﬁguration as state transitions. The
tools developed in this thesis generate representations similar
to RSGs automatically from a speciﬁed reconﬁguration se-
quence. It is also possible to introduce optimization techniques
based on compile time information to optimize the RSGs and
decrease the amount of conﬁguration data needed (Shirazi
et al., 2000).
