speciÔ¨Åcations in terms of the maximum deviation the pass-
band and in part of the stopband, while minimizing the energy
in the stopband frequency range. This type of approximation is
very useful in modern DSP systems involving subsystems with
different sampling periods. The approximation method dis-
cussed here includes the least squares and minimax approaches
as special cases.
