The word "longest flight" can mean numerous different things. The most commonly used metric would be for distance between the origin airport and destination airport, but it can also refer to longest in term of time needed to fly the route or the distance actually flown by the aircraft. Also, although it is most commonly used to compare between different non-stop flights, direct flights with stops might also be compared in some occasions.
