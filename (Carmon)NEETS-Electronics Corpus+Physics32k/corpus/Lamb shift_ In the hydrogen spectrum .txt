In 1947, Hans Bethe was the first to explain the Lamb shift in the hydrogen spectrum, and he thus laid the foundation for the modern development of quantum electrodynamics. Bethe was able to derive the Lamb shift by implementing the idea of mass renormalization, which allowed him to calculate the observed energy shift as the difference between the shift of a bound electron and the shift of a free electron.  The Lamb shift currently provides a measurement of the fine-structure constant Î± to better than one part in a million, allowing a precision test of quantum electrodynamics.
A different perspective relates Zitterbewegung to the Lamb shift.
