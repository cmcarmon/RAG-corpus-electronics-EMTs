A unique advantage of CMOS is that for all input combinations the steady-state current from VDD to VSS is
almost  zero  because  at  least  one  of  the  series  FETs  is  open.  Since  CMOS  circuits  of  any  complexity  are
interconnections  of  the  basic  gates,  the  quiescent  currents  for  these  circuits  are  extremely  small,  an  obvious
advantage which becomes a necessity for the practicality of digital watches, for example, and one which alleviates
