By taking into account the gravitational correction to the running of the fine structure constant

{\displaystyle \alpha }
of quantum electrodynamics, Harst and Reuter were able to study the impacts of asymptotic safety on the infrared (renormalized) value of



α


{\displaystyle \alpha }
. They found two fixed points suitable for the asymptotic safety construction both of which imply a well-behaved UV limit, without running into a Landau pole type singularity. The first one is characterized by a vanishing

{\displaystyle \alpha }
, and the infrared value




α

IR




{\displaystyle \alpha _{\text{IR}}}
is a free parameter. In the second case, however, the fixed point value of



α


{\displaystyle \alpha }
is non-zero, and its infrared value is a computable prediction of the theory.
