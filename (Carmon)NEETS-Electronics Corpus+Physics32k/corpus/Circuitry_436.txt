It  is  worth  illustrating  this  difficult  concept  using 
some  practical  figures.  Assume  that  you  have  an 
amplifier  with  a  gain  of  9  and  one-tenth  of  the 
output is fed back to the input (i.e. 0 = 0.1). In this 
case the loop gain (0 Ã— Av) is 0.9.  
  With negative feedback applied (see Chapter 7) 
the overall voltage gain will be: 
9
1 0.9
