 simulation avoids the overhead of event queue
processing  by  evaluating  all  devices  at  regular  intervals  of  time.  Cycle-driven  simulation  is  efﬁcient  when  a
design exhibits a high degree of concurrency, i.e., when a large percentage of the devices are active per simulation
 to determine the order in which they are evaluated
cycle. Based on the staging of devices, devices are 
at each time step to ensure the correct causal behavior yielding the proper ordering of events. For functional
veriﬁcation, logic devices are often assigned zero-delay and memory devices are assigned unit-delay. Thus, any
number of stages of logic devices may execute between system clock periods.
