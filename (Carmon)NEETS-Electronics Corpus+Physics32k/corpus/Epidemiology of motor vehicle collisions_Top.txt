Worldwide it was estimated that 1.25 million people were killed and many millions more were injured in motor vehicle collisions in 2013. This makes motor vehicle collisions the leading cause of death among young adults of 15-29 years of age (360,000 die a year) and the ninth cause of death for all ages worldwide. In the United States, 32,675 people died and 2.3 million were injured in crashes in 2014, and around 2,000 kids under 16 years old die every year. It is estimated that motor vehicle collisions caused the deaths of around 60 million people during the 20th century, around the same as the number of World War II casualties.
Modern crash statistics often focus on reportable injury crashes (which include deaths) rather than reporting on deaths alone. It is believed that serious crashes are often significantly under-reported, under-recorded and misclassified and that the completeness of reporting may vary over time and between sources.
