In the 1980s, a large family of operating systems was de-
veloped for personal computers, including MS-DOS, PC-DOS,
Apple-DOS, CP/M. Coherent, Xenix, and MINIX. All these
systems were of limited function, being initially designed for 8-
and 16-bit microprocessor chips with small memories. Proces-
sor speeds and memories of personal computers are now
sufﬁcient to support full-ﬂedged operating systems such as
Linux, FreeBSD, and SUN’s Solaris (Torvalds, 1999; Bowman
et al., 1999).
