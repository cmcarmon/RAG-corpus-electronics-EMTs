The most common of the automatic tracking radars is the MONOPULSE RADAR. The monopulse
radar obtains the three target position coordinates of range, bearing, and elevation from a single pulse.
The receiver for a monopulse radar must have three separate channels to process range, bearing, and
elevation information. The block diagram of a simplified monopulse receiver is shown in figure 2-35.
