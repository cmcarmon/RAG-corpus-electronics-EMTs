A logic diagram of a three-state (modulo-8) synchronous counter is shown in figure 3-24, view A.
The clock input is wired to each of the FFs to prevent possible errors in the count. A HIGH is wired to the
J and K inputs of FF1 to make the FF toggle. The output of FF1 is wired to the J and K inputs of FF2, one
input of the AND gate, and indicator A. The output of FF2 is wired to the other input of the AND gate
and indicator B. The AND output is connected to the J and K inputs of FF3. The C indicator is the only
output of FF3.
