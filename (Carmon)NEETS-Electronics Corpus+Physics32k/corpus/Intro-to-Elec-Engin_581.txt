are beyond the reach of the mainframes, and cost more than ten million dollars. These are used
for weather prediction, image processing, and nuclear-energy studies that require high-precision
processing of ordered data achieved by a speed advantage due to parallel processors. Cyber 205,
Cray X-MP, and Cray 2 are some examples of supercomputers. In the 1980s, supercomputing
centers were developed at six American universities for high performance computing. By 1990 it
was possible to build chips with a million components; semiconductor memories became standard
in all computers; widespread use of computer networks and workstations had occurred. Explosive
growth of wide area networking took place with transmission rates of 45 million bits per second.
