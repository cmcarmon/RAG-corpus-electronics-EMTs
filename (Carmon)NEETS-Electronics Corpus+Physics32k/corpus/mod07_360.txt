The phase shift of 180 degrees between input and output signals is the same as that of common-
cathode vacuum tube circuits (and common-emitter transistor circuits). The reason for the phase shift can 
be seen easily by observing the operation of the N-channel JFET. On the positive alternation of the input 
signal, the amount of reverse bias on the P-type gate material is reduced, thus increasing the effective 
cross-sectional area of the channel and decreasing source-to-drain resistance. When resistance decreases, 
current flow through the JFET increases. This increase causes the voltage drop across R3 to increase, 
which in turn causes the drain voltage to decrease. On the negative alternation of the cycle, the amount of 
reverse bias on the gate of the JFET is increased and the action of the circuit is reversed. The result is an 
output signal, which is an amplified 180-degree-out-of-phase version of the input signal.
