Thevenin’s Theorem is especially useful in analyzing power systems and other circuits
where one particular resistor in the circuit (called the “load” resistor) is subject to change, and
re-calculation of the circuit is necessary with each trial value of load resistance, to determine
voltage across it and current through it. Let’s take another look at our example circuit:
