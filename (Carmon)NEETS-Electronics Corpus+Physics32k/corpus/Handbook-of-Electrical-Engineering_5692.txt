Ideally,  power  should  be  supplied  without  interruptions  at  constant  frequency,  constant  voltage  and  with
perfectly  sinusoidal  and,  in  the  case  of  three-phase,  symmetrical  waveforms.  Supply  reliability  constitutes  a
recognized independent topic, and is not usually discussed under power quality. The speciﬁc object of power
quality is the “
