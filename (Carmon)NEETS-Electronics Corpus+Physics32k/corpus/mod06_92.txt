Some schematics do not show heaters and heater connections. Heaters, of course, are still present in
the tubes, but their appearance in a schematic adds little to understanding the circuit. The heater is not
considered to be an active element. For example, a tube with an indirectly heated cathode and a plate is
still called a diode, even though it might seem that there are three elements in the tube.
