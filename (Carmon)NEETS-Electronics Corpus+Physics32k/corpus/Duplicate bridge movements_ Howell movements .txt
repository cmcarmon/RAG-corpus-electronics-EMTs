In a Howell movement, pairs move according to a schedule that varies depending on the number of tables. Pairs are identified by a pair number that identifies the position they sit for the first round. Traditionally, the highest numbered pair sits North-South at table 1 and does not move from that position; the other pairs move from table to table, sometimes sitting North-South and sometimes East-West. In moving according to the schedule, each pair will arrive at table 1 and sit East-West in the round corresponding to their pair number. Directions are placed on each table telling each player what table and position they move to for the next round.
The Howell movement is better suited for smaller numbers of tablesâ€”as the number of tables grows, the number of rounds that must be played to have every pair play at every position becomes too large. For T tables, there will be (2T-1) rounds, e.g. 7 rounds for 4 tables, but 13 rounds for 7 tables. For larger games where a Howell-type movement is desired, "3/4 Howell" or "Part Howell" movements exist that provide balanced comparisons, accomplished in part by having in addition to the stationary pair at table one, pairs that remain at some higher numbered tables, but who may sit North-South in some rounds and East-West in others.
