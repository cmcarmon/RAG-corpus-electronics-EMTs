Time and frequency transfer describes mechanisms for comparing measurements of time and frequency from one location to another. The technique is commonly used for creating and distributing standard time scales such as International Atomic Time (TAI).
Examples of time and frequency transfer techniques include:
Simultaneous observation methods:
Simultaneous carrier phase observation of GPS signals
Time transfer by simultaneous observation of TV transmissions
Time transfer by simultaneous observation of radio astronomy signals

Two-way transfer methods:
Two-way satellite time and frequency transfer

Network methods:
Network Time Protocol
Precision Time Protocol
