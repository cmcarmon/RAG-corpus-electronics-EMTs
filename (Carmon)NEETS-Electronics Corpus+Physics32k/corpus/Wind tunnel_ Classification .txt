There are many different kinds of wind tunnels. They are typically classified by the range of speeds that are achieved in the test section, as follows:
Low-speed wind tunnel
High speed wind tunnel
Subsonic and transonic wind tunnel
Supersonic wind tunnel
Hypersonic wind tunnel
Wind tunnels are also classified by the orientation of air flow in the test section with respect to gravity. Typically they are oriented horizontally, as happens during level flight. A different class of wind tunnels are oriented vertically so that gravity can be balanced by drag instead of lift, and these have become a popular form of recreation for simulating sky-diving:
Vertical wind tunnel
Wind tunnels are also classified based on their main use. For those used with land vehicles such as cars and trucks the type of floor aerodynamics is also important. These vary from stationary floors through to full moving floors, with smaller moving floors and some attempt at boundary level control also being important.
