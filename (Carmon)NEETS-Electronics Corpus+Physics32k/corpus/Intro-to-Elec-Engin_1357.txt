Figure 14.5.1 illustrates in block-diagram form the principle of noise cancellation as applied
to an aircraft carrying passengers. The electric signal resulting after sampling the noise at the
noise sources is passed through a ﬁlter whose transfer function is continuously adjusted by a
special-purpose computer to match the transfer function of the sound path. An inverted version
of the signal is ﬁnally applied to loudspeakers, which project the sound waves out of phase with
those from the noise sources, nearly canceling the noise. Microphones on the headrests monitor
the sound experienced by the airline passengers so that the computer can determine the proper
ﬁlter adjustments.
