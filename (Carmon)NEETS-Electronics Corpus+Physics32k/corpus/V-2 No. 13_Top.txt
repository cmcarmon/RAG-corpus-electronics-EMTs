The White Sands rocket (official name V-2 No. 13) was a modified V2 rocket that became the first man-made object to take a photograph of the Earth from outer space. Launched on October 24, 1946, at the White Sands Missile Range in White Sands, New Mexico, the rocket reached a maximum altitude of 65 mi (105 km).
The famous photograph was taken with an attached DeVry 35mm black-and-white motion picture camera.
