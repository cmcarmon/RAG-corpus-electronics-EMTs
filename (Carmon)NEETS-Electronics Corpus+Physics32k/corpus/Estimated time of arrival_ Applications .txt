Accurate and timely estimations of times of arrival are important in several application areas:
In air traffic control arrival sequencing and scheduling, where scheduling aircraft arrival according to the first-come-first-served order of ETA at the runway minimizes delays.
In airport gate assignment methods, to optimize gate utilization.
In elevator control, to minimize the average waiting time or journey time of passengers (destination dispatch).
