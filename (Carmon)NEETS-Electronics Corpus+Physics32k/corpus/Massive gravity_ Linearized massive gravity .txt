At the linear level, one can construct a theory of a massive spin-2 field

{\displaystyle h_{\mu \nu }}
propagating on Minkowski space. This can be seen as an extension of linearized gravity in the following way. Linearized gravity is obtained by linearizing general relativity around flat space,

{\displaystyle h_{\mu \nu }}

Massive gravity is obtained by adding nonderivative interaction terms for

{\displaystyle h_{\mu \nu }}
. At the linear level (i.e., second order in

Fierz and Pauli showed in 1939 that this only propagates the expected five polarizations of a massive graviton (as compared to two for the massless case) if the coefficients are chosen so that

{\displaystyle a=-b}
. Any other choice will unlock a sixth, ghostly degree of freedom. A ghost is a mode with a negative kinetic energy. Its Hamiltonian is unbounded from below and it is therefore unstable to decay into particles of arbitrarily large positive and negative energies. The Fierz-Pauli mass term,

{\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}_{\mathrm {FP} }=m^{2}\left(h^{\mu \nu }h_{\mu \nu }-\left(\eta ^{\mu \nu }h_{\mu \nu }\right)^{2}\right)}

is therefore the unique consistent linear theory of a massive spin-2 field.
