Practicing engineers frequently use models to investigate the behavior of complex systems. Traditionally, models
have  been  physical  devices  or  a  set  of  mathematical  expressions.  The  widespread  use  of  powerful  digital
computers now allows one to generate computer programs that model physical systems. Although the detailed
development and use of computer models differs signiﬁcantly from their physical and mathematical counter-
parts,  the  computer  models  share  many  of  the  same  design  constraints  and  trade-offs.  For  any  model  to  be
useful  one  must  guarantee  that  the  response  of  the  model  to  stimuli  will  closely  match  the  response  of  the
target system, the model must be designed and fabricated in much less time and at signiﬁcantly less expense
than  the  target  system,  and  the  model  must  be  reasonably  easy  to  validate  and  modify.  In  addition  to  these
constraints, designers of computer models must assure that the amount of processor time required to execute
the model is not excessive. The optimal model is the one that appropriately balances these conﬂicting require-
ments. Figure 78.3 describes the typical design trade-off faced when developing computer models. A somewhat
surprising observation is that the optimal model is often not the one that most closely approximates the target
system. A highly detailed model will typically require a tremendous amount of time to develop, will be difﬁcult
to validate and modify, and may require prohibitive processor time to execute. Selecting a model that achieves
a good balance between these constraints is as much an art as a science. Being aware of the trade-offs which
exist, and must be addressed, is the ﬁrst step toward mastering the art of modeling.
