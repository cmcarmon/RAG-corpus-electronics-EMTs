Three- and four-element arrays are shown in figure 3-14, views (B) and (C), respectively. The field 
pattern of each array is shown beneath it. Note that the beam becomes sharper as the number of elements 
is increased. If a still-narrower beam is desired, you may add additional elements. The field patterns of the 
antennas in the figure are bidirectional. Unidirectional patterns may be obtained with a parasitic reflector 
mounted behind the driven antenna elements.
