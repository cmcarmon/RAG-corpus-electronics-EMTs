To illustrate
the power of the method,
let us revisit the RC circuit from Figure 13.3 (redrawn
here as Figure 13.10a for convenience) and analyze it using the impedance method just
described. As before, suppose that we wish to find the steady-state capacitor voltage vc in
response to an input of the form vi = Vi cos ω1t.
Figure 13.10b shows the corresponding impedance model. In the model, notice that we
have replaced the input voltage vi with the real amplitude Vi, and the capacitor voltage
vc with the complex amplitude Vc, according to the first step of the impedance method.
Further, according to the second step of the method, we have replaced the resistor with
an R box and the capacitor with a box with impedance 1/Cs. As before, s is a shorthand
notation for jω.
