An arbitrary conﬁguration of an array of N identical antennas
is shown in Figure 6.19. The center of the ith antenna is
deﬁned by a position vector RRi ¼ ^xxxi þ ^yyyi þ ^zzzi, and the
input current to the ith antenna is Ii. The electric ﬁeld of the
array in the far-ﬁeld region can be expressed as the superpos-
ition of the individual contributions:
