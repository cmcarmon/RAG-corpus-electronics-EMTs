One critical aspect of gas discharges is the requirement for external priming as shown in the lower part of
Fig. 83.25. The avalanche process shown in Fig. 83.24 needs at least one electron to start the discharge growth.
Without  this  Ô¨Årst  electron,  the  discharge  will  not  start  at  any  voltage.  Priming  electrons  can  come  from  a
number of different active particles created either by a prior discharge or by neighboring discharging pixels.
Active particles include free electrons, free ions, metastable atoms, and ultraviolet photons.
