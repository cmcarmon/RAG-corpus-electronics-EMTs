Sims began piano lessons at age four, followed soon after by singing lessons. After hearing one of Sims' songs, Britney encouraged her to pursue a music career. In 2007, Sims released an EP of On My Own, a cover of the Les Miserables song. Sims described the cover as "more of a filler song until I get my new stuff recorded. Honestly, we put that one up there [on her website] because all the other ones I had put down in the past had a little more of a country vibe, and I do not want to go there at all." Sims worked with music producers Evan Bogart and J.R. Rotem to compile an album.
In 2009, Sims released a single called "Driving Blind." The single was about Britney and missing her after their estrangement. Perez Hilton reviewed a sneak peek of the track, calling it "shiteous." At that time, Sims stated that there were no solid plans for touring dates. Rolling Stone called Sims "a naive [social] climber with hopes of releasing her own album."
