Alternatively, i2 and i3 can be determined by viewing R2 and the series equivalent
of R3 and R4 as a current divider of i1.
Finally, since i3 is now known, R3 and R4 in Figure 2.51a can be viewed
as a voltage divider of v2, or they can be multiplied by i3 = i4, to determine v3
and v4. Doing so yields
