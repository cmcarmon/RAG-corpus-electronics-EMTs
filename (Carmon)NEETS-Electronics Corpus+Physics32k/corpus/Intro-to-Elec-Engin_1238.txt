13.2.11 A three-phase, wye-connected, 220-V, 10-hp, 60-
Hz, six-pole induction motor (using Figure 13.2.6
for notation) has the following parameters in
ohms per phase referred to the stator: R1 =
= 0.209,
0.294, R
and Xm = 13.25. The total friction, windage,
and core losses can be assumed to be constant at
403 W, independent of load. For a slip of 2.00%,
compute the speed, output torque and power, sta-
tor current, power factor, and efÔ¨Åciency when the
motor is operated at rated voltage and frequency.
Neglect the impedance of the source.
