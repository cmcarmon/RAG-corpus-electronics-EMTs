We ﬁrst ﬁx our attention to one particular point in space, say z = 0. We then have the electric vector Ex(z,t) =
E0 cos wt. Plotted as a function of time, we ﬁnd that the waveform repeats itself in time as wt = 2mp for any
integer m. The period is deﬁned as the time T for which wT = 2p. The frequency f is deﬁned as f = 1/T which gives
