Distributed RLC Model: As the rise/fall times become shorter, the relative contributions of capacitance and
inductance change. In particular, the impedance of the capacitance is inversely proportional to frequency
while that of the inductance is proportional to frequency. At sufﬁciently high data rates, the inductance
effects become signiﬁcant. In this case, the signal is delayed as it propagates toward the far-end gates,
with the rise/fall times increasing along the line. Different terminal points of a net will see the signal at
different times with different rise/fall times.
