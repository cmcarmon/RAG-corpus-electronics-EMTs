First of all, you should place the cylinder in a suitable location, which has sufficient space to work. If you are working in a cluttered space, it will be difficult for you to keep track of opened up parts. After bringing the cylinder to an appropriate spot, open the cylinder ports and drain out all the hydraulic fluid. The cover of cylinder can be removed by unscrewing the bolts. Once you take off the cover, remove the piston by loosening the input valves.
