The trick is performed by progressively engaging the front brake and leaning forward to shift the center of mass closer to the front wheel. The rider then tries to balance by shifting their weight and keeping the rear wheel as high as possible.
If the bicycle rider does not have a front brake, then experienced riders may jam a foot in between the tire and front fork while pushing forward. Stoppies can also be accomplished without front brakes with the aid of a roadside curb. If the bike's wheels are 24" or larger they will normally mount the curb instead of being stopped by it.
