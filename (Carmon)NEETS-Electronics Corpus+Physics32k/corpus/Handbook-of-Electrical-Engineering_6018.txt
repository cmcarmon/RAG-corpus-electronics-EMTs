Energy management is the process of monitoring, coordinating, and controlling the generation, transmission,
and distribution of electrical energy. The physical plant to be managed includes generating plants that produce
energy fed through transformers to the high-voltage transmission network (grid), interconnecting generating
plants and load centers. Transmission lines terminate at substations that perform switching, voltage transfor-
mation, measurement, and control. Substations at load centers transform to subtransmission and distribution
levels. These lower-voltage circuits typically operate radially, i.e., no normally closed paths between substations
through subtransmission or distribution circuits. (Underground cable networks in large cities are an exception.)
Since transmission systems provide negligible energy storage, supply and demand must be balanced by either
generation or load. Production is controlled by turbine governors at generating plants, and automatic generation
control is performed by control center computers remote from generating plants. Load management, sometimes
called demand-side management, extends remote supervision and control to subtransmission and distribution
circuits, including control of residential, commercial, and industrial loads.
