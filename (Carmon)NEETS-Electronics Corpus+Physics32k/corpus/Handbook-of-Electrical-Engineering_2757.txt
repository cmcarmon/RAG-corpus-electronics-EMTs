The PMOS transistors used in the pull-up section are fabricated with P-type source and drain regions on
N-type substrates. The NMOS transistors used in the pull-down section, on the other hand, are fabricated with
N-type source and drain regions on P-type substrates. Since a given silicon wafer is either N-type or P-type, a
deep, opposite doping-type region must be placed in the silicon wafer for those transistors needing a substrate
of  the  opposite  type.  The  shaded  regions  in  Fig. 25.27(a)  represent  the “substrate  types”  within  which  the
