Based on the ability of the junction to dissipate power in the form of heat, the maximum
forward current rating is speciﬁed. Based on the maximum electric ﬁeld that can exist in the
depletion region, the peak inverse voltage (maximum instantaneous value of the reverse-bias
voltage) rating is speciﬁed.
