of the loads.1 What has been described is ideal in a number of ways. First, the circuit can be unbalancedâ€”for
example, by the loads being somewhat unequal. Second, since the real devices whose ideal model is a voltage
source are coils of wire, each source should be accompanied by a branch consisting of the coil inductance and
resistance. Third, since the power station (or the distribution transformer at some intermediate point) may be
at some distance from the load, the parameters of the physical line carrying the power (the line inductance and
resistance) must also be inserted in series between the source and the load.
