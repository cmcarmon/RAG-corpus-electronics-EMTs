Thevenin’s	Theory,	conceptualized	by	Hermann	von	Helmholtz	and	Leon	Charles
Thevenin,	discusses	that	if	a	circuit	follows	a	linear	network,	any	point	can	be
replaced	given	that	it	remains	to	carry	a	source	for	current,	resistance,	and	voltage.
Behind	it,	the	idea	is	to	supply	an	equivalent.
Originally,	Thevenin’s	Theory	can	only	be	applied	to	circuits	that	operate	with	a
DC	system;	since	a	DC	system	is	rather	simple,	replacing	its	components	with	an
equivalent	is	possible.	Eventually,	however,	its	capability	to	handle	a	load	in	a	non-
linear	system	was	discovered;	it	can	offer	solutions	for	an	AC	system.
Moreover,	the	Thevenin	Theory	puts	emphasis	on	that	the	average	circuit	can	only
be	considered	to	have	a	linear	according	to	a	limited	range;	it	can	only	be	replaced
by	the	components	of	with	values	among	the	range.
The	Thevenin	Theory	follows	that	power	dissipation	can	yield	unique	values,	and
can	also	yield	identical	values.	However,	the	results	can	only	be	accomplished
with	the	power	supplied	by	an	external	resistor.
