The three delta-connected capacitors, shown in figure 1-29, usually come as a unit mounted in a case 
with three external connections. The entire unit is called a SYNCHRO CAPACITOR. The synchro 
capacitor is made in many sizes to meet the requirements of all sizes of standard differentials and control 
transformers. The synchro capacitor is rated by its total capacity, which is the sum of the individual 
capacities in the unit.
