Unfortunately, it is not generally possible to characterize thermally induced structural failures, which develop
as a result of differential thermal expansion among the materials constituting an electronic package, in the form
of  an  Arrhenius  relation.  Although  these  mechanical  stresses  may  well  increase  as  the  temperature  of  the
component  is  elevated,  thermal  stress  failures  are,  by  their  nature,  dependent  on  the  details  of  the  local
temperature ﬁelds, as well as the assembly, attachment, and local operating history of the component. Further-
more, thermal stress generation in packaging materials and structures is exacerbated by power transients, as
well as by the periodically varying environmental temperatures, experienced by most electronic systems, during
both qualiﬁcation tests and actual operation. However, stress variations in the elastic domain or in the range
below the fatigue limit may have little effect on the component failure rate. Consequently, the minimization
or elimination of thermally induced failures often requires careful attention to both the temperature and stress
