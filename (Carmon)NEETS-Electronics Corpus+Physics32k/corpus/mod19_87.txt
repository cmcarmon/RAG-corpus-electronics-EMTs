Applying finger pressure is very tiring, and it can seldom be maintained for more than 15 minutes. 
Pressure points are recommended for use while direct pressure is being applied to a serious wound. While 
pressure is being applied at the appropriate pressure point, an assistant can bandage the wound (or 
wounds). If available, a battle dressing should be used. Figure 1-7 shows the battle dressing and its use. 
After opening the dressing, be careful not to contaminate it. Place the compress portion over the wound, 
then bind it tightly in place with the attached straps. If bleeding continues to be severe even after direct 
pressure and pressure points have been used, you may have to apply a tourniquet.
