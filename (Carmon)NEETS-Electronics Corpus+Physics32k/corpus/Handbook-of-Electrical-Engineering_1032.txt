These are just a few of the types of operations that can be performed by signal processing techniques. For some
applications, an analog or continuous output signal is needed, and thus a digital-to-analog (D/A) converter is
used to convert the modiÔ¨Åed digital signal to a continuous signal. Another device called a transducer can be
used to convert the continuous electrical signal to another form; for example, a speaker converts a continuous
electrical signal to an acoustical signal.
