s o u r c e f o l l o w e r c i r c u i t Modify the source follower circuit from
Figure 7.24 to include an input bias voltage that maximizes input voltage swing. Assume
that VS = 10 V.
Figure 7.45 shows the biased circuit, where VB is the bias voltage and vA is the input
signal. The total signal, vIN, is the sum of the offset voltage and the actual input. Recall
that the input offset voltage (VB) is applied to boost the input signal (vA) in a way that
the MOSFET remains in saturation for the maximum positive and negative excursions
of the input signal.
