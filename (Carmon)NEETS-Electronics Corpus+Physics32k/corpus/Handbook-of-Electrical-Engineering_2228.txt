where t is the momentum relaxation time. Consequently vd = –mn
%, where mn = qt/m*n is the electron mobility. For
an n-type semiconductor with uniform electron density, n, the current density jn = –qnvd and we obtain Ohm’s law
jn = s% with the conductivity s  = qnmn. The momentum relaxation time can be approximately expressed as
