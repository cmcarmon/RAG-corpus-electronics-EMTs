FIGURE 71.3
Current  noise  densities  from  receivers,  RIN,  and
shot  noise  as  a  function  of  total  received  photocurrent.  Receiver
noise is dominant in FM or some digital systems where the total
received power is small. The solid line for receiver noise represents
the  noise  current  for  a  typical  50-
  low-noise  ampliÔ¨Åer.  More
sophisticated receiver designs could reduce the noise to the levels
shown approximately by the dotted lines. RIN and shot noise are
more important in AM-VSB systems.
