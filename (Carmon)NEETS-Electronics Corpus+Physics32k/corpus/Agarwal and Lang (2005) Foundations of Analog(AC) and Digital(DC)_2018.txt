For the element values that we have chosen, the denominator of Equation 14.24
indeed yields a pair of complex roots, and hence the system is resonant.
Figure 14.6 shows a computer-generated plot of the corresponding frequency
response. The magnitude plot clearly displays the frequency sensitive behavior
of the circuit: Both low and high frequencies are attenuated, giving this response
the characteristics of a bandpass filter.
More interestingly, observe the behavior of both the magnitude and phase
plots at the frequency 2 Ã— 106 rads/sec. At this frequency, the magnitude plot
displays a sharp peak and the phase plot shows an abrupt phase transition.
The rest of this section will provide more insight into this response, and will
discuss how we can quickly guess the form of the frequency response for system
functions with complex roots. Section 14.2.1 will further show that the sharp
transitions of the magnitude and phase at the resonant frequency are directly
related to the complex roots. Section 14.4 goes on to show how we can sketch
the complete form of the response of resonant system functions without the
use of a computer.
