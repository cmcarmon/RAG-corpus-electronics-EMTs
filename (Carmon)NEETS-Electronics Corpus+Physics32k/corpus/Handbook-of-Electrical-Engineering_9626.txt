The advantage of a parallel computer is that it can run more than one program simultaneously. In a general-
purpose  time-sharing  environment,  parallel  computers  can  greatly  enhance  overall  system  throughput.  A
program shares a CPU with fewer programs. This approach is similar to having several computers connected
on a network but has the advantage that all resources are more easily shared.
