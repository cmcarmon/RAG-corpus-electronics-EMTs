that can also be calculated as a function of frequency if the EC
topology and element noise sources are given (Vendelin, 1990).
F depends on a number of transistor parameters as well as on
the generator impedance ZG and increases at high frequencies
as shown in Figure 5.11(B). Toward low frequencies, F in-
creases again due to ﬂicker noise. For Si and SiGe bipolar
transistors, typical values of the corner frequency ffn are in
the order of 1 to 10 kHz, which is much lower than in MOS
transistors, for example. Of particular interest for circuit ap-
plications is the minimum noise factor Fmin at high frequen-
cies, which is obtained by determining the minimum of F with
respect to real and imaginary parts of ZG. At high frequencies,
Fmin can be expressed analytically as a function of dc bias,
transistor parameters, and frequency dependent y-parameters
(Voinigescu et al., 1997); a reasonable simpliﬁcation is as
follows:
