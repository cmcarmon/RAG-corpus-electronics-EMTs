In previous subsection, we simpliÔ¨Åed the network power bal-
ance equations into a single power conservation equation by
either ignoring the losses (equation 8.2) or by approximating
the line losses (equation 8.9). However, in both earlier ap-
proaches, the network nature of the power transmission was
completely ignored. In this section, we treat the power trans-
mission in earnest by stating the power balance equations in
full, which summarizes the transfer of power from the gener-
ators to the loads through the transmission network. The
optimization itself has the same objective of minimizing the
total cost of generation.
