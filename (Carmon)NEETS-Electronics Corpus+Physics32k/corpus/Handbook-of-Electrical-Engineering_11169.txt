Biomedical sensors and instrumentation are used in biomedical research and patient care applications. In terms
of patient care, sensors are used as a part of instruments that carry out patient screening by making measure-
ments such as blood pressure using automated apparatus. Specimen analysis is another important application
of biomedical sensors in patient care. This can include analyses that can be carried out by the patients themselves
in their homes such as is done with home blood glucose analyzers. Instrumentation based upon biomedical
sensors can be used in the physician’s ofﬁce for carrying out some chemical analyses of patient specimens such as
urinalysis or elementary blood chemistries such as serum glucose and electrolytes. Sensors also are a part of large
multicomponent automatic blood analyzers used in the central clinical laboratory of major medical centers.
