The diode bridge circuit shown in ﬁgure 4.8 is a full-wave rectiﬁer. The diodes act to
route the current from both halves of the AC wave through the load resistor in the same
direction, and the voltage developed across the load resistor becomes the rectiﬁed output
signal. The diode bridge is a commonly used circuit and is available as a four-terminal
component in a number of diﬀerent power and voltage ratings.
