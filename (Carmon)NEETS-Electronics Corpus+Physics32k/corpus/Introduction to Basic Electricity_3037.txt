Electrons flow through the P side of the diode, at-
tracted by the positive terminal of the voltage source. 
As electrons leave the P material, holes are created that 
drift toward the Pâ€“N junction, where they combine 
with other electrons. When the current flows from the 
N-type toward the P-type material, the diode is said to 
have a forward bias.
