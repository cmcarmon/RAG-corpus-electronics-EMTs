The first earthquake occurred at 11:10:26 UTC (18:10 local time) on 12 September 2007, and was an 8.4 Mw earthquake on the moment magnitude scale. It was centered about 34 km underground, at 4.520°S 101.374°E﻿ / -4.520; 101.374, about 130 km southwest of Bengkulu on the southwest coast of Sumatra, Indonesia, and some 600 km west-northwest of Indonesia's capital city, Jakarta. It was followed by several earthquakes of magnitude 5 through 6 along the same fault, west of Sumatra.
The second largest earthquake, 7.9 Mw, occurred later the same day at 23:49:04 UTC (06:49:04 local time the following day). It was centred about 10 km underground, at 2.506°S 100.906°E﻿ / -2.506; 100.906, some 185 km (115 mi) south-southeast of Padang, Indonesia and about 205 km northwest of Bengkulu (about 225 km northwest of the magnitude 8.5 earthquake).
After further aftershocks above magnitude 5, a third earthquake, 7.0 Mw, occurred at 03:35:26 UTC (10:35:26 local time) on 13 September. It was centred about 10 km underground, at 2.160°S 99.851°E﻿ / -2.160; 99.851, some 165 km south-southwest of Padang and 345 km west-northwest of Bengkulu.
Aftershocks continued into 13 September and 14 September, with more earthquakes ranging up to magnitude 6.4. Most of the aftershocks have been northwest of the original magnitude 8.4 earthquake. A 6.7 struck Southern Sumatra on Sept 20, 2007.
Tidal buoys positioned in the Indian Ocean and other seismic tools have led scientists to issue a series of tsunami bulletins.
