In 1963, Edward Lorenz developed a simplified mathematical model for atmospheric convection. The model is a system of three ordinary differential equations now known as the Lorenz equations:

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\frac {\mathrm {d} x}{\mathrm {d} t}}&=\sigma (y-x),\\{\frac {\mathrm {d} y}{\mathrm {d} t}}&=x(\rho -z)-y,\\{\frac {\mathrm {d} z}{\mathrm {d} t}}&=xy-\beta z.\end{aligned}}}

The equations relate the properties of a two-dimensional fluid layer uniformly warmed from below and cooled from above. In particular, the equations describe the rate of change of three quantities with respect to time:



x


{\displaystyle x}
is proportional to the rate of convection,



y


{\displaystyle y}
to the horizontal temperature variation, and



z


{\displaystyle z}
to the vertical temperature variation. The constants



σ


{\displaystyle \sigma }
,



ρ


{\displaystyle \rho }
, and



β


{\displaystyle \beta }
are system parameters proportional to the Prandtl number, Rayleigh number, and certain physical dimensions of the layer itself.
The Lorenz equations also arise in simplified models for lasers, dynamos, thermosyphons, brushless DC motors, electric circuits, chemical reactions and forward osmosis.
From a technical standpoint, the Lorenz system is nonlinear, non-periodic, three-dimensional and deterministic. The Lorenz equations have been the subject of hundreds of research articles, and at least one book-length study.
