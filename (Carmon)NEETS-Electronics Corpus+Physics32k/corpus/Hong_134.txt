. This means 
that the signal transfer from the output of the op amp to Vout is attenuated by a factor of 
103 when the diode is reverse biased. Therefore, Vout essentially maintains the voltage on 
the capacitor C and is not affected by the output of the op amp when the diode is reverse 
biased (Vin < Vout).
