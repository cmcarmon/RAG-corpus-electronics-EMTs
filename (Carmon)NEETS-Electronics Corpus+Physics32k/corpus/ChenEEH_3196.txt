RG insulators have demonstrated their success for station-
and line-post applications. However, for cap and pin suspen-
sion insulators, judging from previous service experience, their
record has not been as good. One problem for line insulators is
the corrosion of the glaze near the pin where the current
density is the highest, which ultimately causes a discontinuity
or ‘‘opening’’ of the glaze in that region. Once the glaze has
been opened, the effectiveness of the glaze is lost as surface
discharges can develop in areas similar to those for a regular
glazed porcelain insulator. Another problem experienced with
RG cap and pin suspension insulators is related to the expan-
