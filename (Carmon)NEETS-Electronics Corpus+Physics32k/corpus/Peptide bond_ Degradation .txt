A peptide bond can be broken by hydrolysis (the addition of water). In the presence of water they will break down and release 8–16 kilojoule/mol (2–4 kcal/mol) of free energy. This process is extremely slow, with the half life at 25C of between 350 and 600 years per bond.
In living organisms, the process is normally catalyzed by enzymes known as peptidases or proteases, although there are reports of peptide bond hydrolysis caused by conformational strain as the peptide/protein folds into the native structure . This non-enzymatic process is thus not accelerated by transition state stabilization, but rather by ground state destabilization.
