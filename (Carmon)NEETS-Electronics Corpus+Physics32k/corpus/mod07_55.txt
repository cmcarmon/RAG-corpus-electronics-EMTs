Science and industry also rely heavily on semiconductor devices. Research laboratories use these
devices in all sorts of electronic instruments to perform tests, measurements, and numerous other
experimental tasks. Industrial control systems (such as those used to manufacture automobiles) and
automatic telephone exchanges also use semiconductors. Even today heavy-duty versions of the solid-
state rectifier diode are being use to convert large amounts of power for electric railroads. Of the many
different applications for solid-state devices, space systems, computers, and data processing equipment
are some of the largest consumers.
