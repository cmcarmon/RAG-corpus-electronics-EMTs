For  planar  arrays,  direct  generalizations  of  the  preceding  linear  array  results  can  be  obtained.  To  wit,  if  the
sensors with unity weights are located at coordinates (kD,  lD), where k = 0, –1, –2, . . ., –[( N–1)/2], and l =
0, –1, –2, . . ., –[( M–1)/2], for odd integer values of N and M, then the array pattern function becomes
