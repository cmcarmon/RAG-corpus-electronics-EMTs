For discrete scheduling designs, abrupt changes in the con-
troller output can occur at switching instants. These changes
may cause excitation of unmodeled plant dynamics, degrading
performance and possibly leading to catastrophic failure. To
mitigate these risks, one must resort to techniques such as
bumpless transfer (Hanus et al., 1987) or ensure that the
design can tolerate the switching through other methods
(Bett and Lemon, 1999).
