Wind speed increases with height above the surface; at the same time, wind speed may vary over short periods of time as gusts. These considerations may be described empirically.
Measurements show that wind speed, (V (h ) ) varies, according to a power law with height (h ) above a non-zero measurement height datum (h0 —e.g. at the height of the foot of a sail), using a reference wind speed measured at the datum height (V (h0 ) ), as follows:

{\displaystyle V(h)=V(h_{0})\left({\frac {h}{h_{0}}}\right)^{p}}

Where the power law exponent (p) has values that have been empirically determined to range from 0.11 over the ocean to 0.31 over the land.
This means that a V (3 m) = 5-m/s (≈10-knot) wind at 3 m above the water would be approximately V (15 m) = 6 m/s (≈12 knots) at 15 m above the water. In hurricane-force winds with V (3 m) = 40-m/s (≈78 knots) the speed at 15 m would be V (15 m) = 49 m/s (≈95 knots) with p = 0.128. This suggests that sails that reach higher above the surface can be subject to stronger wind forces that move the centre of effort (CE ) higher above the surface and increase the heeling moment.
Additionally, apparent wind direction moves aft with height above water, which may necessitate a corresponding twist in the shape of the sail to achieve attached flow with height.
