Figure 3-31, view (A), shows a transformer with resistance in both the primary and secondary 
circuits. If S1 is closed, current will flow through R1 and L1. As the current increases in L1, it induces a 
voltage into L2 and causes current flow through R2. The voltage induced into L2 depends on the ratio of 
turns between L1 and L2 as well as the current flow through L1.
