Light Source
Laser diodes or light-emitting diodes (LEDs) supply the optical carrier waves for most Ô¨Åber links. LEDs cannot
operate at speeds in the gigabit range, but laser diodes can. For this reason, laser diodes are normally required
for high-rate, long-distance links. Laser diodes can be modulated at frequencies beyond 40 GHz.
