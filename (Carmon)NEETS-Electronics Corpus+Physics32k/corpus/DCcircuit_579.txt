This circuit is neither simple series nor simple parallel. Rather, it contains elements of both.
The current exits the bottom of the battery, splits up to travel through R3 and R4, rejoins, then
splits up again to travel through R1 and R2, then rejoins again to return to the top of the
battery. There exists more than one path for current to travel (not series), yet there are more
than two sets of electrically common points in the circuit (not parallel).
