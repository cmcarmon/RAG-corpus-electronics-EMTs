Prior  to  the  late  1970s,  signaling  for  circuit  establishment  was  in-band.  That  is,  in  order  to  set  up  a  call
through the network, the call set-up information was sent sequentially from switch to switch using the actual
circuit that would eventually become the circuit used to connect the end users. In an extreme case, this amounted
to trying to ﬁnd a path through a maze, sometimes having to retrace one’s steps before ﬁnally emerging at the
destination or just simply giving up when no path could be found. This had two negative characteristics: ﬁrst,
the rate of signaling information transfer was limited to the circuit speed, and second, the circuits that could
have been used for accomplishing the end objective were being consumed simply to ﬁnd a path between the
end-points. This resulted in tremendous bottlenecks on major holidays, which were solved by virtually disal-
lowing alternate routes through the toll switching network.
