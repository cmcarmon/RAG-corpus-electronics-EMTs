Tait–Bryan rotations are a special case in which the first and third axes are perpendicular among them. Assuming a reference frame <x,y,z> with a convention as in image 2, and a plane with <yaw, pitch, roll> axes like in the image 1, lying horizontal on the plane <x,y> in the beginning, after performing intrinsic rotations Y, P and R in the yaw, pitch and roll axes (in this order) we obtain something similar to image 3.

In the beginning :
the plane roll axis is on axis x of the reference frame
the plane pitch axis is on axis y of the reference frame
the plane yaw axis is on axis z of the reference frame
The rotations are applied in order yaw, pitch and roll. In these conditions, the Heading (angle on the horizontal plane) will be equal to the yaw applied, and the Elevation will be equal to the pitch.

Of the six possible combinations of yaw, pitch and roll, this combination is the only one in which the heading (direction of the roll axis) is equal to one of the rotations (the yaw), and the elevation (angle of the roll axis with the horizontal plane) is equal to other of the rotations (to the pitch).
