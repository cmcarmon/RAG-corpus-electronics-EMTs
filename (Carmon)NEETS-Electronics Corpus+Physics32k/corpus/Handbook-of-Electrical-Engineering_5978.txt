Reduced models suitable for limited frequency ranges are often preferred over complex models because of
the relative ease in usage â€” as in determining the values of model parameter and in implementing a simulation.
In  practice,  reduced  models  that  portray  essential  behavior  over  a  limited  frequency  range  are  obtained  by
making judicious approximations. Hence, one has to be aware of the assumptions and limitations when deciding
on the level of modeling details of other components in the simulation and when interpreting the simulation
results.
