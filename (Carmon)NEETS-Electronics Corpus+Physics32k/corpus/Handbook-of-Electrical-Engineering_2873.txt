While  commonly  used  solder  paste  for  both  THT  and  SMT  production  contains  63-37  eutectic  tin-lead
solder, other metal formulations are available, including 96-4 tin-silver (a.k.a. silver solder). The ﬂuxes available
include RMA, water-soluble, and no-clean. The correct decision rests as much on the choice of ﬂux as it does
on the proper metal mixture. A solder paste supplier can best advise on solder pastes for speciﬁc needs. Many
studies  are  in  process  to  determine  a  no-lead  replacement  for  lead-based  solder  in  commercial  electronic
assemblies.  The  design  should  investigate  the  current  status  of  these  studies  as  well  as  the  status  of  no-lead
legislation as part of the decision-making process.
