A line does not have to be any particular length to produce standing waves; however, it cannot be an
infinite line. Voltage and current must be reflected to produce standing waves. For reflection to occur, a
line must not be terminated in its characteristic impedance. Reflection occurs on lines terminated in
opens, shorts, capacitances, and inductances, because no energy is absorbed by the load. If the line is
terminated in a resistance not equal to the characteristic impedance of the line, some energy will be
absorbed and the rest will be reflected.
