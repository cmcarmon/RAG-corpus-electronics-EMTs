The UNIX Shell
To use UNIX, a user has to log in Ô¨Årst by typing user name and
password. After a successful login, the login program starts up
the command line interpreter, which is most likely a shell
variant such as Bourne Shell, Korn Shell, or Berkeley C Shell
that has been designed to make it look like C program. A user
can choose whatever shell variant he or she likes. The shell
initializes itself and then displays a prompt character, often a
dollar sign, on the screen and waits for the user to type a
command line.
