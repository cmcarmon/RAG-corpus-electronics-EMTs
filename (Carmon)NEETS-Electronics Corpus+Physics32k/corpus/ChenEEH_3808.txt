Having deﬁned the meaning of frequency content of two-
dimensional signals, we are now ready to state conditions
under which an image can be recovered from its samples. It
is well known that most useful digital images have the signiﬁ-
cant part of the amplitude spectrum concentrated at low
frequencies. Therefore, an image in general can be modeled
as a bandlimited two-dimensional signal; that is, its Fourier
