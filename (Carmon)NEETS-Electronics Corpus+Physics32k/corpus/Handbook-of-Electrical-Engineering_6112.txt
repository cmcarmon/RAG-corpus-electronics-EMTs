As a follow on from the basic load ﬂow analysis, where signiﬁcant unbalanced load or unbalanced transmis-
sion causes problems, a three-phase load ﬂow may be required to study their effects. These programs require
each phase to be represented separately and mutual coupling between phases to be taken into account. Trans-
former winding connections must be correctly represented and the mutual coupling between transmission lines
on the same tower or on the same right-of-way must also be included.
