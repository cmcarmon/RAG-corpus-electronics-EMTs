Architecture of WLAN
WLAN consists of access points and terminals that have a
WLAN connectivity. Finding the optimal locations for access
points is important and can be achieved by measuring the
relative signal strength of the access points. Placing the access
points in a corporation network opens an access way to the
resources in an intranet. With wired LANs, an intruder must
ﬁrst gain physical access to the building before he or she can
plug a computer to the network and eavesdrop on the trafﬁc.
The intranet is typically considered secure even though em-
ployees can cause security breaches and data are transmitted
unencrypted. If the information transmitted in the corpo-
ration network is extremely valuable to the corporation, the
WLAN interface should be protected from unauthorized users
and eavesdropping. The obvious way to extend the intranet
with a wireless LAN is to connect the access points directly to
the intranet as illustrated in Figure 6.4.
