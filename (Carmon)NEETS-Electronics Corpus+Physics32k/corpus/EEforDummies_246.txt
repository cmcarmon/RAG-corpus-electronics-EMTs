area; the larger the diameter, the easier it is for electrons to move â€” that 
is, the lower the resistance to their movement. Think of water flowing 
through a pipe: The wider the pipe, the easier the water flows. Along 
the same lines, a copper wire with a large diameter has lower resistance 
than a copper wire with a small diameter.
