Building facility grounds must be provided for electrical faults, signal, and lightning. The fault protection
(green wire) subsystem is for the protection of personnel and equipment from the hazards of electrical power
faults  and  static  charge  buildup.  The  lightning  protection  system  consists  of  air  terminals  (lightning  rods),
heavy duty down-conductors, and ground rods. The 
 provides a ground for signal
circuits  to  control  static  charges  and  noise  and  to  establish  a  common  reference  between  signals  and  loads.
