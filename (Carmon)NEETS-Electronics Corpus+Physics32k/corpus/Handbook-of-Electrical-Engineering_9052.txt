Thermal  Transfer  Printing. The  desire  to  eliminate  costly  special  thermal  papers  even  for  low-cost  serial
printers led to the development of the thermal transfer printing technology where a separate transfer ribbon
is interposed between the thermal printhead and the paper (see Thermal Page Printing above for discussion of
ribbon technology).
