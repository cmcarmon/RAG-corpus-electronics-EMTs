Methods differ in the way the signatures are assigned to the
nodes and in how the reference information is represented. In
SIC (Lu, 1982), the nodes are encoded (labeled) by selecting 8-
bit numbers randomly and independently from a uniform
distribution. The reference information for the WD is repre-
sented under the form of a reference program that has the
same CFG as the checked program. In place of computations,
it contains statements to receive and check the signatures from
the main processor.
