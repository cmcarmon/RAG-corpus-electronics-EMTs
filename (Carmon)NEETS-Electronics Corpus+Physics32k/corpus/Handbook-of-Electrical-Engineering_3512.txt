Any  sort  of  communication  is  composed  of  two  elements:  language  and  mechanism.  Language  provides
common semantics; mechanism provides a means by which to convey the common semantics. For example,
people  communicate  via  a  language,  such  as  English  or  German,  and  a  mechanism,  such  as  a  telephone  or
electronic mail. For design, a digital system can be described in many ways, involving different perspectives or
abstractions
. An abstraction deﬁnes at a particular level of detail the behavior or semantics of a digital system,
i.e., how the outputs respond to the inputs. Fig. 34.3 illustrates several popular levels of abstractions. Moving
from the lower left to the upper right, the level of abstraction generally increases, meaning that physical models
are the most detailed and speciﬁcation models are the least detailed. The trend toward higher levels of design
entry abstraction supports the need to address greater levels of complexity [Peterson, 1981].
