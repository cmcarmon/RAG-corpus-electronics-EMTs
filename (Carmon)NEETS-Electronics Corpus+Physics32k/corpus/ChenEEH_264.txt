Figure 1.30 shows the push-pull forward VRM topology
(Zhou, 1999). In the primary side, switch and transformer
windings are alternately connected in a circle. A capacitor is
connected between any of
two interleaved terminations.
The left two terminations are connected to the input and
ground, respectively. The two primary windings have the
same turns. Figure 1.31 explains the operation of this con-
verter.
