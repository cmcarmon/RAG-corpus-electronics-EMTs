In theory, with only through-hole passive compo-
nents and discrete transistors, a single layer is all that 
is necessary (Figure 48-8). Most radio-frequency (RF) 
printed circuit boards have traces on only one side, 
although a second layer is used as a ground plane 
to improve performance, as shown in Figure 48-9. 
Standard integrated circuit pin outs used with analog 
ICs—such as op-amps, timers, and so on—can get by 
with a single layer. This is because there is plenty of 
room for traces to pass between the leads of the pas-
sive components.
