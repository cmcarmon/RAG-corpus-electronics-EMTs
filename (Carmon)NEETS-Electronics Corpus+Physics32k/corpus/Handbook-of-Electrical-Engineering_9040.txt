spot size of 150–200 mm on paper can be achieved with an oriﬁce diameter of about 50 mm. Even greater device
efﬁciency can be obtained by synchronizing the arrival of a direct wave and a reﬂected wave at the nozzle (e.g.,
a negatively reﬂected wave caused by an initial expansion pulse plus the direct wave from a following compres-
sion pulse). These two waves can be made to reinforce one another at the time and place of drop ejection.
