In physics, a field is an assignment of a quantity (vector, tensor, or spinor) to every point of the space containing it. The word "torsion" refers to any variable that describes rotation. Thus, torsion fields (i.e., fields of any physical value reasonably described as "torsion") do exist in established physics aside from in this pseudoscientific case, where the terms have been misappropriated. For example, an electromagnetic wave with circular polarization or the stress tensor of a solid body under torsion stress can be described as torsion fields, although such usage is rare. The torsion tensor is a quantity in general relativity, and plays an important role in Einstein–Cartan theory. Spinor fields, in particular fermionic fields, are existing concepts from particle physics and quantum field theory.
Aside from this established research, advocates of the spinor field or torsion field theories claim that spin-spin interaction –  itself a well-studied quantum phenomenon –  can be transmitted through space similar to electromagnetic waves, does not carry mass or energy but only information, and does so at speeds of up to a billion times the speed of light. If this were true, it would violate special relativity. At the same time they claim that spin-spin interaction is carried by neutrinos –  which have very little mass and high energy –  that it does not interact with matter but, at the same time, can be generated and detected easily.
