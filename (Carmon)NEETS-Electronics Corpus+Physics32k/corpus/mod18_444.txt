Whether of the fixed-frequency or tunable type, the radar transmitter frequency should be checked 
periodically. If the transmitter is of the fixed-frequency type and found to be operating outside its normal 
operating band, the problem is probably a defective part. The defective component must be replaced. If 
the transmitter is tunable, the transmitter must again be tuned to the assigned frequency.
