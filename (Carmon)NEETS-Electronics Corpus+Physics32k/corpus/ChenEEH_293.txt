In general, noise coupling is proportional
to the cross-
sectional area that is shared by the two lines. Coupling is also
proportional to frequency and inversely proportional to the
separation. Therefore, as integrated circuits are scaled to
smaller dimensions and operate at higher frequencies, the
detrimental effects of charge sharing become more severe.
