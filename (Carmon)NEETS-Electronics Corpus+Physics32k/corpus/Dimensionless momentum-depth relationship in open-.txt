Given that:
and that:
according to the Buckingham π theorem, with dimensional analysis, we can normalize the relationship between depth and Momentum by dividing both by the value of the critical depth squared and substituting for q2 to yield:

If we let M’ = uM/yc2, and y’ = y/yc, this equation becomes:
