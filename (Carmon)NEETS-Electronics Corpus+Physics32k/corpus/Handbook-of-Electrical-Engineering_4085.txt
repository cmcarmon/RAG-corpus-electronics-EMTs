The spectrum for use in electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) purposes covers only from a few hertz (extreme
low frequency, ELF) to 40 GHz (microwave bands). ELF has been in use mostly in the area of biological research
and ELF communications. On the other side of the spectrum, the electronic devices must function in a hostile
environment, in military applications, over the gigahertz frequency range.
