This subsection shows the simulation results associated with
the model of a geostationary satellite equipped with a bias
momentum wheel on the third axis of body frame. This
model assumes that the disturbance torque is Gaussian white
noise. A stochastic RS controller is then applied. For this
model, small attitude angle and roll/yaw dynamics are assumed
to be decoupled from the pitch dynamics.
