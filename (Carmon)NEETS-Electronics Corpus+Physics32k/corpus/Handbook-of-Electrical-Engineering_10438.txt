Therefore,  S(y)  ⊂  S  is  the  smallest  set  of  models,  according  to  all  the  available  input  data  (a  priori  and  a
posteriori), that are indistinguishable from the point of view of the input information. This means that with
the knowledge of (y, S, ᏺ) there is no way to select a smaller set of candidate models. The “size” of set S(y)
places a lower bound on the identiﬁcation error, which cannot be decreased unless we add some extra infor-
mation to the problem. This lower bound on the uncertainty error holds for any identiﬁcation algorithm and
represents a type of uncertainty principle of identiﬁcation theory.
