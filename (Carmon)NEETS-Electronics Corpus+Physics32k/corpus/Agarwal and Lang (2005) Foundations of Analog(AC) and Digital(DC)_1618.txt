Energy Dissipated During Interval T1
Let us first consider the case when the input to the MOSFET switch is high
and the switch is closed, and derive the value of w1. When the switch is closed,
the situation corresponds to that shown in Figure 11.9 and the circuit shown
in Figure 11.10 applies. Figure 11.11 shows the Th√©venin equivalent for this
circuit.
