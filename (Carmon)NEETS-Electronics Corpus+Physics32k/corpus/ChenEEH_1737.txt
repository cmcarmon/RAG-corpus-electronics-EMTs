Text is inherently digital, whereas other media types like
sound and visuals can be analog and need to be converted
into digital form using appropriate analog to digital conver-
sion techniques. In this chapter, we assume that all media types
have been suitably digitized; the reader is invited to read a
book by Chapman and Chapman (2000) that gives an excellent
introduction to the principles and standards used to convert
many such analog media to digital form. In this chapter, we
focus on typical characteristics of different media types when
transported over a network. In this regard, multimedia net-
working deals with the design of networks that can handle
multiple media types with ease and deliver scalable perform-
ance.
