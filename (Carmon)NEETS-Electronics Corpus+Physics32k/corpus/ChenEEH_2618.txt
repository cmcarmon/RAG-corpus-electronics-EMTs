The ﬁeld displacement isolators show excellent performance
with reverse isolation better than 30 dB and forward insertion
loss lower than 0.3 dB. Compared to the resonance isolators,
they require a much smaller bias ﬁeld because they operate
below resonance. In addition to the waveguide geometry, other
forms of the ﬁeld displacement isolators have been developed,
which include strip line and ﬁnline types.
