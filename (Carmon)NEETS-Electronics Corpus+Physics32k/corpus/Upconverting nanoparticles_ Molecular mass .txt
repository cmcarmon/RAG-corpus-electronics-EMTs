For many chemical and biological applications, it is useful to quantify the concentration of upconversion nanoparticles in terms of Molecular mass. For this purpose, each nanoparticle can be considered a macromolecule. To calculate the molecular mass of a nanoparticle, the size of the nanoparticle, the size and shape of the unit cell structure, and the unit cell elemental composition must be known. These parameters can be obtained from transmission electron microscopy and x-ray diffraction respectively. From this, the number of unit cells in a nanoparticle, and thus the total mass of the nanoparticle, can be estimated.
