. Quantizer saturation: The quantizer allocates L levels to
the task of approximating the continuous range of inputs
with a Ô¨Ånite set of outputs (see Figure 2.11). The range of
inputs for which the difference between the input and
output is small
is called the operating range of the
converter. If the input exceeds this range, the difference
between the input and output becomes large, and we say
that the converter is operating in saturation. Saturation
errors are more objectionable than quantizing noise. Gen-
erally, saturation is avoided by use of automatic gain
control (AGC), which effectively extends the operating
range of the converter.
