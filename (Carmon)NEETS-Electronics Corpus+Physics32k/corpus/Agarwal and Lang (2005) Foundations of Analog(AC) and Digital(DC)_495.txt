From the preceding discussion, the effect on the output voltage Vo of the source V1
acting alone can be found by forming a subcircuit in which all other independent sources
are set to zero, which in this case means replacing V2, V3, and V4 by short circuits, as
shown in Figure 3.44b. Now Voa, the response to V1 alone, can be found by inspection
