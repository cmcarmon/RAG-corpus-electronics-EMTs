The nonreciprocal behavior of ferrite microwave compon-
ents is basically described by two different scalar permeabilities
for oppositely rotating microwave magnetic ﬁelds that are per-
pendicular to the static magnetic ﬁeld. Thus, a microwave signal
will propagate through a ferrite differently in different direc-
tions. The propagation characteristics are controlled by the
strength of the applied magnetic ﬁeld, which is also related to
the power handling capability. Once the biasing ﬁeld exceeds a
threshold value, the transmission loss increases rapidly. The
dielectric properties of ferrite materials are described by the
relative permittivity and the loss tangent tan d ¼ e00=e0, with e0
being the real part of the dielectric constant and e00 being the
imaginary part. High-quality commercial ferrites have values of
the loss tangent lower than 0.001 for microwave applications.
