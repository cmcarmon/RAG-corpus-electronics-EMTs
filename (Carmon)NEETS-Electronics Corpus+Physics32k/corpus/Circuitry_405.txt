where  ROUT  is  the  output  resistance  (in  ohms), 
VOUT(OC) is the open-circuit output voltage (in volts) 
and  IOUT(SC)  is  the  short-circuit  output  current  (in 
amps). 
 
Input offset voltage 
 
An ideal operational amplifier  would provide zero 
output voltage when 0 V difference is applied to its 
inputs.  In  practice,  due  to  imperfect 
internal 
balance, there may be some small voltage present at 
the  output.  The  voltage  that  must  be  applied 
differentially  to  the  operational  amplifier  input  in 
order  to  make  the  output  voltage  exactly  zero  is 
known as the input offset voltage.  
Input  offset  voltage  may  be  minimized  by 
 
applying  relatively 
large  amounts  of  negative 
feedback  or  by  using  the  offset  null  facility 
provided  by  a  number  of  operational  amplifier 
devices.  Typical  values  of  input  offset  voltage 
range from 1 mV to 15 mV. Where AC rather than 
DC  coupling  is  employed,  offset  voltage  is  not 
normally a problem and can be happily ignored. 
 
Full-power bandwidth 
 
The  full-power  bandwidth  for  an  operational 
amplifier  is  equivalent  to  the  frequency  at  which 
the  maximum  undistorted  peak  output  voltage 
swing  falls  to  0.707  of  its  low  frequency  (d.c.) 
value  (the  sinusoidal 
input  voltage  remaining 
constant).  Typical  full-power  bandwidths  range 
from  10  kHz  to  over  1  MHz  for  some  high-speed 
devices.
