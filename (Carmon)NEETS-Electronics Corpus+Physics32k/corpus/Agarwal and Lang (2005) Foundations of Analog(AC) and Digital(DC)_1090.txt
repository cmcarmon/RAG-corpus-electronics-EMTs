This problem studies the use of a mythical MOSFET-like device
called a ZFET to construct an amplifier as shown in Figure 7.77. The ZFET operates
in its saturation region when vGS â‰¥ 0 and vDS > 0. In this region, the drain-source
terminal relation is iDS = Kv 3
GS, where K is a constant having units of A/V3. When
vDS = 0, the ZFET exhibits a short circuit between its drain and source terminals, and is
said to operate outside its saturation region. Similarly, the ZFET exhibits an open circuit
for vGS < 0 as it again operates outside its saturation region. Finally, the gate terminal
always exhibits an open circuit. These characteristics are summarized in Figure 7.77,
beneath the symbol for the ZFET.
