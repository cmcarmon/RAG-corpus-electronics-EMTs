Now, at resonance, XL is still equal to X C. Therefore, IL must equal IC. Remember, the voltage is the 
same; the reactances are equal; therefore, according to Ohm's law, the currents must be equal. But, don't 
forget, even though the currents are equal, they are still opposites. That is, if the current is flowing "up" in 
the capacitor, it is flowing "down" in the coil, and vice versa. In effect, while the one component draws 
current, the other returns it to the source. The net effect of this "give and take action" is that zero current 
is drawn from the source at resonance. The two currents yield a total current of zero amperes because they 
are exactly equal and opposite at resonance.
