Bosons may be either elementary, like photons, or composite, like mesons.
While most bosons are composite particles, in the Standard Model there are five bosons which are elementary:
the four gauge bosons or vector boson (spin-1) (γ · g · Z · W±)
the one scalar boson (spin-0) (the Higgs boson (H0))
Additionally, the graviton (G) is a hypothetical elementary particle not incorporated in the Standard Model. If it exists, a graviton must be a boson, and could conceivably be a gauge boson. However, since the graviton, the hypothetical force mediating particle for the gravitational force, has no mass and a spin of 2, it would be a tensor boson.
Composite bosons are important in superfluidity and other applications of Bose–Einstein condensates.
