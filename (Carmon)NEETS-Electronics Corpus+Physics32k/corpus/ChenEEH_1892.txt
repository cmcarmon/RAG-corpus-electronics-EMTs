To increase the dependability of a system, many strategies
have been proposed in the literature for the different phases of
the computing system development. In the design and imple-
mentation phase, fault avoidance can be achieved by proven
design methodologies and technologies and by formal veriÔ¨Å-
cation. In the test and debugging phase, fault removal can be
performed. Both methods can be referred to as fault preven-
tion and can avoid fault occurrence or introduction. In the
operational phase, fault-tolerance methods are applied to
provide a proper system service in spite of faults (Lee and
Anderson, 1990).
