 When switch S1 is closed (as shown), a voltage ES appears across the voltage divider. At this instant 
the current will attempt to increase to its maximum value. However, this instantaneous current change 
causes coil L to produce a back EMF, which is opposite in polarity and almost equal to the EMF of the 
source. This back EMF opposes the rapid current change. Figure 2-10(B) shows that at the instant switch 
S1 is closed, there is no measurable growth current (ig), a minimum voltage drop is across resistor R, and 
maximum voltage exists across inductor L.
