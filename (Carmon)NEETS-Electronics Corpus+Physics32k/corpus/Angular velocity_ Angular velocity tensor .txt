A similar way to describe the angular speed for a rotating frame is the angular velocity tensor. It can be introduced from rotation matrices. Any vector






r
→





{\displaystyle {\vec {r}}}
that rotates around an axis with an angular speed vector






ω
→





{\displaystyle {\vec {\omega }}}
(as defined before) satisfies:







d



r
→



(
t
)


d
t



=



ω
→



×



r
→





{\displaystyle {\frac {d{\vec {r}}(t)}{dt}}={\vec {\omega }}\times {\vec {r}}}

We can introduce here the angular velocity tensor associated to the angular speed



ω


{\displaystyle \omega }
:




W
(
t
)
=

{\displaystyle W(t)={\begin{pmatrix}0&-\omega _{z}(t)&\omega _{y}(t)\\\omega _{z}(t)&0&-\omega _{x}(t)\\-\omega _{y}(t)&\omega _{x}(t)&0\\\end{pmatrix}}}

Notice that this is an infinitesimal angular displacement divided by an infinitesimal time. This tensor W(t) will act as if it were a



(



ω

×
)


{\displaystyle ({\vec {\omega }}\times )}
operator :







ω

r

r

{\displaystyle {\vec {\omega }}(t)\times {\vec {r}}(t)=W(t){\vec {r}}(t)}
