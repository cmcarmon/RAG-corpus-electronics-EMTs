Consider next
the superluminal artifact present at
the
leading edge of
the wave shown in Figure 9.9(B) for
f Â¼ 0, 90 but not for f Â¼ 45. This is again due to short-
wavelength numerical modes in the grid generated at the
leading edge of the outgoing step-function wave. However,
these modes have spatial wavelengths so short that their grid
sampling density drops below the threshold delineated in
equation 9.45, and the modes appear in the superluminal
and exponentially decaying regime. With S Â¼
=2 in the
present example, we conclude that the lack of a superluminal
artifact along the f Â¼ 45 cut (and the consequent exact
modeling of the step discontinuity at the leading edge of the
wave) is due to a dispersionless numerical wave propagation
along grid diagonals.
