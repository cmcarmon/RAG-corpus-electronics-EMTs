This example demonstrated that the network functions are
ratios of polynomials in the variable s. If the elements are
given by their numerical values, we can ﬁnd roots of such
polynomials. Roots of the numerator polynomial are called
zeros, and roots of the denominator are called poles. From
mathematics, we know that a polynomial has many zeros just
as the highest power of the s variable. In the above example, the
denominator is a polynomial of second degree, and the network
has two poles. Since the numerator in this example is only a
constant, the network will not have any (ﬁnite) zeros.
