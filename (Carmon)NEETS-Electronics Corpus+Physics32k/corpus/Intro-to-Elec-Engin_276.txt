Eliminating the need to write the circuit differential equations explicitly, transformed net-
works, which are networks converted directly from the time domain to the frequency domain,
are used. For the three elements R, L, and C, the transformed network equivalents, using Ta-
ble 3.3.1, are based on the Laplace transforms of their respective volt-ampere characteristics,
as follows:
