Standard Graphic Symbols
The use of standardized graphical symbols is becoming widespread and the family of registers have their own
coherent  set  of  symbols.  Two  representative  examples  are  given  in  Fig. 81.41.  As  shown,  the  eight-bit  shift
register is designated SGR8. The direction of shift is given by the arrow. The “1D” is part of a notation called
dependency notation. Clock input C1 controls the inputs labeled 1D, of which only one of four is shown. The
reset “R” and the clock are common to all units and are shown as inputs to the common block. The external
reset line carries a polarity symbol which indicates that a low signal must be applied to reset the 4-bit register.
