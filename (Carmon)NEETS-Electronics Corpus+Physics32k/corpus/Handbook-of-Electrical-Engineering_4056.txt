Figure 40.4 illustrates the shielding effectiveness of a variety of common materials versus various thicknesses
for a source distance of 1 m. This is the shielding effectiveness of a six-sided enclosure. To be useful, the enclosure
must be penetrated for various services or devices. This is illustrated in Fig. 40.5(a) for small enclosures and
Fig. 40.5(b) for room-sized enclosures.
