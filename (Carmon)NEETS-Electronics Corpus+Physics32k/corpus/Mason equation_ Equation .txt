In Mason's formulation the changes in temperature across the boundary layer can be related to the changes in saturated vapour pressure by the Clausius–Clapeyron relation; the two energy transport terms must be nearly equal but opposite in sign and so this sets the interface temperature of the drop. The resulting expression for the growth rate is significantly lower than that expected if the drop were not warmed by the latent heat.
Thus if the drop has a size r, the inward mass flow rate is given by

{\displaystyle {\frac {dM}{dt}}=4\pi r_{p}D_{v}(\rho _{0}-\rho _{w})\,}
