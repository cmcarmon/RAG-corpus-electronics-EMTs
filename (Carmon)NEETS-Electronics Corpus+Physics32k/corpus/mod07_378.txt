The SILICON CONTROLLED RECTIFIER (SCR) is a four-element, solid-state device that 
combines characteristics of both diodes and transistors. The symbol for the SCR is shown below. A signal 
must be applied to the gate to cause the SCR to conduct. When the proper gate signal is applied, the SCR 
conducts or "fires" until the bias potential across the device drops below the minimum required to sustain 
current flow. Removal of the gate signal does not shut off the SCR. In fact, the gate signal is often a very 
narrow voltage pulse or trigger. The SCR is ideal for use in situations where a small, low-power gate can 
be used to turn on larger currents, such as those found in rectifier and switching circuits. SCRs are used 
extensively in power supply circuits as rectifiers.
