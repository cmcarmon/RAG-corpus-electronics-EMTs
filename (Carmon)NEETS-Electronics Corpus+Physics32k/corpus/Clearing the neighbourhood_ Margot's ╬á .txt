Astronomer Jean-Luc Margot has proposed a discriminant, Π, that can categorise a body based only on its own mass, its semi-major axis, and its star's mass. Like Stern–Levison's Λ, Π is a measure of the ability of the body to clear its orbit, but unlike Λ, it is solely based on theory and does not use empirical data from the Solar System. Π is based on properties that are feasibly determinable even for exoplanetary bodies, unlike Soter's µ, which requires an accurate census of the orbital zone.

where m is the mass of the candidate body in Earth masses, a is its semi-major axis in AU, M is the mass of the parent star in solar masses, and k is a constant. Π depends on the extent of clearing desired and the time required to do so. Margot selected an extent of

times the Hill radius and a time limit of the parent star's lifetime on the main sequence (which is a function of the mass of the star). Then, in the mentioned units and a main-sequence lifetime of 10 billion years, k = 807. The body is a planet if Π > 1. The minimum mass necessary to clear the given orbit is given when Π = 1.
Π is based on a calculation of the number of orbits required for the candidate body to impart enough energy to a small body in a nearby orbit such that the smaller body is cleared out of the desired orbital extent. This is unlike Λ, which uses an average of the clearing times required for a sample of asteroids in the asteroid belt, and is thus biased to that region of the Solar System. Π's use of the main-sequence lifetime means that the body will eventually clear an orbit around the star; Λ's use of a Hubble time means that the star might disrupt its planetary system (e.g. by going nova) before the object is actually able to clear its orbit.
The formula for Π assumes a circular orbit. Its adaptation to elliptical orbits is left for future work, but Margot expects it to be the same as that of a circular orbit to within an order of magnitude.
