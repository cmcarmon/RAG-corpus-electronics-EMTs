Models  of  three-phase  synchronous  and  induction  machines  for  studying  electromechanical  and  low-fre-
quency electrical transients are well established because of the importance of generator and load behavior in
stability  and  fault  studies.  Electric  machines,  however,  do  interact  with  other  connected  components  over  a
wide range of frequencies, from fractions of Hertz for electromechanical phenomena to millions of Hertz for
electromagnetic phenomena.
