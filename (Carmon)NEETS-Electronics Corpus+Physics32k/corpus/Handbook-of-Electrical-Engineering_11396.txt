Principles of Pulse-Echo Ultrasound
Ultrasound imaging usually employs frequencies in the 2- to 10-MHz range, though some of the new intra-
vascular probes use higher frequencies. Images are formed by using a transducer within a probe to generate a
short pulse (typically on the order of 1 ms in duration) of ultrasound which is propagated through the tissue.
A portion of the energy in this pulse is reﬂected back toward the transducer from specular reﬂectors and from
scatterers  in  the  tissue.  These  acoustic  echoes,  with  amplitudes  much  lower  than  the  transmitted  pulse,  are
converted by the transducer to electrical signals which are converted to a (rectiﬁed) video signal, ampliﬁed by
a time gain controlled ampliﬁer, and displayed. The A-mode display is rarely used but simply involves display
of the received echoes as amplitude versus time of arrival. The time of arrival is related by the wave speed to
the tissue depth from which the echo returns, i.e., d = ct/2. Figure 116.5 provides a very simple representation
of this process where the A-mode display associated with specular reﬂection from three different interfaces is
illustrated. For clinical imaging the interfaces would not necessarily be perpendicular to the axis of the sound
beam, and there would be a continuum of echoes, a continuous received signal, due to energy backscattered
from within the tissues. Since the ultrasound pulse is attenuated as it propagates, all ultrasonic imaging systems
use a logarithmic variation of ampliﬁer gain with time to compensate the exponential attenuation of the tissue.
Thus, echoes from structures reﬂecting or backscattering the same fraction of the incident signal will have the
same amplitude after passing through the time gain controlled ampliﬁer.
