A multiterminal element is a no-gain element if every
connected circuit containing that element, positive resistors,
and independent sources possesses the no-gain property.
A circuit possesses the no-gain property if, for each solution
to the dc network equations, the magnitude of the voltage
between any pair of nodes is not greater than the sum
of the magnitudes of the voltages appearing across the net-
work’s independent
the magnitude
of the current ﬂowing through any element of the network
must not be greater than the sum of the magnitudes of
the currents ﬂowing through the network’s independent
sources. For example, when considering a multiterminal’s
large-signal dc behavior, Ebers-Moll modeled bipolar junction
transistors, ﬁled-effect transistors, silicon-controlled rectiﬁers,
and many other three-terminal devices are passive and incap-
able of producing voltage or current gains (Gopinath and
Mitra, 1971; Willson, 1975).
