Preparing to solder
To solder, you need a soldering iron (25–30 watts), a spool of 16‐ or 22‐gauge 
standard solder (60/40 rosin‐core), a secure soldering stand, and a small 
sponge. Make sure you secure your soldering iron in its stand and position it 
in a safe place on your workbench, where it’s unlikely to be knocked over.
