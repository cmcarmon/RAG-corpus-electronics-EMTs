In this section, we examine several parasitic capacitances and inductances that
are commonly encountered inside integrated circuits, and in external wiring
connections to them and other circuit elements. There is again the danger that
this discussion implies that capacitors and inductors appear most commonly
as parasitics in circuits. This is certainly not the case. Rather, we examine
the parasitics here primarily for interest sake, and because they will provide
interesting and important circuit examples in future chapters.
