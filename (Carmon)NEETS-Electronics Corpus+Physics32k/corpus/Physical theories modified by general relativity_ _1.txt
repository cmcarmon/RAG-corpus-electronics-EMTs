Inertial motion is motion free of all forces. In Newtonian mechanics, the force F acting on a particle with mass m is given by Newton's second law,



F
=
m



r
¨





{\displaystyle F=m{\ddot {r}}}
, where the acceleration is given by the second derivative of position r with respect to time t . Zero force means that inertial motion is just motion with zero acceleration:

{\displaystyle {\frac {\mathrm {d} ^{2}r}{\mathrm {d} t^{2}}}=0}

The idea is the same in special relativity. Using Cartesian coordinates, inertial motion is described mathematically as:









d

d


τ

=
0


{\displaystyle {\frac {\mathrm {d} ^{2}x^{a}}{\mathrm {d} \tau ^{2}}}=0}

where xa is the position coordinate and τ is proper time. (In Newtonian mechanics, τ ≡ t, the coordinate time).
In both Newtonian mechanics and special relativity, space and then spacetime are assumed to be flat, and we can construct a global Cartesian coordinate system. In general relativity, these restrictions on the shape of spacetime and on the coordinate system to be used are lost. Therefore, a different definition of inertial motion is required. In relativity, inertial motion occurs along timelike or null geodesics as parameterized by proper time. This is expressed mathematically by the geodesic equation:

where

{\displaystyle \Gamma _{bc}^{a}}
is a Christoffel symbol. Since general relativity describes four-dimensional spacetime, this represents four equations, with each one describing the second derivative of a coordinate with respect to proper time. In the case of flat space in Cartesian coordinates, we have

{\displaystyle \Gamma _{bc}^{a}=0}
, so this equation reduces to the special relativity form.
