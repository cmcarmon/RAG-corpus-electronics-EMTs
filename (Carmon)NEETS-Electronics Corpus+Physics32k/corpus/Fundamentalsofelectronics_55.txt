To multiply, the radius equals the product of the radii and the angle the sum of the angles. To divide,
the radius equals the ratio of the radii and the angle the diﬀerence of the angles. When the original
complex numbers are in Cartesian form, it’s usually worth translating into polar form, then performing the
multiplication or division (especially in the case of the latter). Addition and subtraction of polar forms
amounts to converting to Cartesian form, performing the arithmetic operation, and converting back to polar
form.
