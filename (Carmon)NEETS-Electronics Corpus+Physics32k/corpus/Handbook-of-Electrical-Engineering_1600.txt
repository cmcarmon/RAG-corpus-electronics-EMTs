Probability density function: The probability of the random variable taking values between two real numbers
x1 and x2 is given by the area under the nonnegative probability density function between those two points.
Random variable: A continuous or discrete valued variable that maps the set of all outcomes of an experiment
into the real line (or complex plane). Because the outcomes of an experiment are inherently random,
the Ô¨Ånal value of the variable cannot be predetermined.
