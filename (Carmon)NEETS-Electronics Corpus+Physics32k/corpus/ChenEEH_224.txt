One of the most important problems when designing a tran-
sistor circuit is to ﬁnd its dc operating point(s) (i.e., voltages and
currents in a circuit when all sources are dc sources). The
mathematical problem of ﬁnding a nonlinear circuit’s dc oper-
ating points is described by a set of nonlinear algebraic
equations constructed by applying Kirchhoff ’s voltage and cur-
rent laws and by employing the characteristic of the circuit
elements. A common numerical approach for ﬁnding these
operating points is the Newton–Raphson method and its
variants. These methods require a good starting point and
sometimes fail. This is known as the dc convergence problem.
In the past decade, several numerical techniques based on
continuation, parameter-embedding, or homotopy methods
have been proposed to successfully solve convergence problems
that often appear in circuits possessing more than one dc
operating point (Melville et al., 1993; Trajkovic´, 1999; Wolf
and Sanders, 1996; Yamamura and Horiuchi, 1990; Yamamura
et al., 1999).
