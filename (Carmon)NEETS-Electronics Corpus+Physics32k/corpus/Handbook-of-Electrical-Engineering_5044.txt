Dielectric constant «¢: A quantity that determines the amount of electrostatic energy which can be stored
per unit volume per unit potential gradient. It is a real quantity and in Gaussian–CGS units is numerically
equal to the ratio of the measured capacitance of the specimen, C, to the equivalent geometrical capac-
itance in vacuo, Co. It is also commonly referred to as the real value of the permittivity. Note that when
the SI system of units is employed, the ratio C/Co deﬁnes the real value of the relative permittivity e¢r .
Dielectric  loss: The  rate  at  which  the  electrical  energy  supplied  to  a  dielectric  material  by  an  alternating
