technical control of the Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA). Alterations which affect shipboard 
systems and equipment under the technical control of other systems commands; for example, air 
alterations (AIRALTS), ordnance alterations (ORDALTS), and special program alterations (SPALTS), 
are not SHIPALTS. However, they may require concurrent SHIPALTS if changes affect shipboard 
system interface.
