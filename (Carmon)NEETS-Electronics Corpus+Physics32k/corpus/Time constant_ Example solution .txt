An example solution to the differential equation with initial value V0 and no forcing function is




V
(
t
)
=

V

o



e

−
t

/

τ




{\displaystyle V(t)=V_{o}e^{-t/\tau }}

where





V

o


=
V
(
t
=
0
)


{\displaystyle V_{o}=V(t=0)}

is the initial value of V. Thus, the response is an exponential decay with time constant τ.
