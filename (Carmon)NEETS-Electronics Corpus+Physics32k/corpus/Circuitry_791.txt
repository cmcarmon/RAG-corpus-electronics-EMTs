Netlists and component models 
 
The following is an example of how a netlist for a 
simple  differential  amplifier  is  constructed  (note 
that the line numbers have been included  solely for 
explanatory purposes): 
 
1.  SIMPLE DIFFERENTIAL PAIR 
2.  VCC  7  0    12 
3.  VEE  8  0    -12 
4.  VIN  1  0    AC 1 
5.  RS1  1  2    1K 
6.  RS2  6  0    1K 
7.  Q1   3  2  4  MOD1 
8.  Q2   5  6  4  MOD1 
9.  RC1  7  3    10K 
10.  RC2  7  5    10K 
11.  RE   4  8    10K 
12.  MODEL  MOD1  NPN  BF=50  VAF=50
