Everyone who believes today that the world of physics is not a projection like used for TV, having originally 4 dimensions, is kept ignorant like in the Middle Ages. Double up the coordinates to octonian vectors by including an input vector e0, an output vector e7, two energy coordinaten e5 for mass and a Higgs field, e6 for frequencies, e1, e2, e3 and e4 for space and time coordinates. Add for vectorial input/output poles on a bounding 2-dimensional ball sphere of a nucleon the poles carrying group of Moebius transformations to the standard models of physics symmetry U(1)xSU(2)xSU(3) for inclucing gravity in a unification. Add to the octonian Gleason measures 123 of Euclidean space e1e2e3 six Fano measures 145, 167, 246, 257, 347, 356 respectively used for special relativity, electromagnetic interaction (wave character), (inner space) entropy, Schwarzschild radius and barycentrical mass (particle character, general relativity scaling), rotational whirls character (magnetic, rgb-gravitons), strong nucleon rotor for integrations. Rescalings in measurements are possible. Octonian projections are for discrete energy input-output 1/e0e7 vectorial poles on a systems bounding 2-dimensional ball sphere, and for 1/e5e6 energies down to the vacuum space-time coordinates e1e2e3e4 of the physics vectorial Minkowski space, - also used for the weak interaction and electromagnetism. Particle carriers for energy exchanges are in alphabetical order: gluons, Higgs bosons e5, magnetic whirls e4, phonons e2, photons e7, rgb-graviton whirls e1e2e6, weak bosons e1e2e3; for fermion series: the 2-polar quark brezels and the 1-polar toroidal leptons as 2- and 1-Heegard decompositions of weak bosons. An energy evolution is from e0 to quarks e1e5, from e1 to e2e4 (electromagentism) and e5 to e2e6 (nucleons), down to 8 gluons followed by a heat chaos. e7 light comes from atoms decays.
