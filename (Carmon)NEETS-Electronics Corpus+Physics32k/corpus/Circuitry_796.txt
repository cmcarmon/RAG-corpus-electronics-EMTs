Practical investigation  
 
Objective 
 
To investigate the use of SPICE software to analyse 
a DC coupled power amplifier circuit. 
 
Components and test equipment 
PC with SPICE software (e.g. Tina Pro, Multisim, 
or B2 Spice, see Appendix 9). 
 
Procedure 
 
Construct the circuit shown in Fig. 17.20 using the 
screen  drawing  facilities  provided  by  the  SPICE 
program. Carry out a DC analysis of the circuit and 
record the voltages in Table 17.1. Check that these 
are what you would expect. 
  Use the data from the DC analysis to determine: 
 
(a) the quiescent (no-signal) collector current in
