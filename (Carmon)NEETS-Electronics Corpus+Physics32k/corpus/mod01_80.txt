Inasmuch as the K shell can contain no more than two electrons, it must have only one subshell, the s
subshell. The M shell is composed of three subshells: s, p, and d. If the electrons in the s, p, and d
subshells are added, their total is found to be 18, the exact number required to fill the M shell. Notice the
electron configuration for copper illustrated in figure 1-4. The copper atom contains 29 electrons, which
completely fill the first three shells and subshells, leaving one electron in the "s" subshell of the N shell.
