Shape
Shape is an important criterion for matching objects based on
their proﬁle and physical structure. In image retrieval applica-
tions, shape features can be classiﬁed into global and local
features. Global features are the properties derived from the
entire shape, such as roundness, circularity, central moments,
and eccentricity. Local features are those derived by partial
processing of a shape, including size and orientation of con-
secutive boundary segments, points of curvature, corners, and
turning angle. Another categorization of shape representation
is boundary-based and region-based. The former uses only
the outer boundary of the shape, while the latter uses the
entire shape of the region. Fourier descriptors and moment
invariants are the most widely used shape representation
schemes. The main idea of a Fourier descriptor is to use the
Fourier transformed boundary as the shape feature. Moment
invariant technique uses region-based moments, which are
invariant to transformations, as the shape features. Hu et al.
(1962) proposed a set of seven invariant moments derived
from second and third moments. This set of moments is
invariant to translation, rotation, and scale changes. Finite
element method (FEM) (Pentland et al., 1996) has also been
used as shape representation tool. FEM deﬁnes a stiffness
matrix that describes how each point on the object is con-
nected to other points. The eigenvectors of the stiffness matrix
are called modes and span a feature space. All the shapes
are ﬁrst mapped into this space, and similarity is then com-
puted based on the eigenvalues. Along the similar lines of
Fourier descriptors, Arkin et al. (1991) developed a Turning
function-based approach for comparing both convex and con-
cave polygons.
