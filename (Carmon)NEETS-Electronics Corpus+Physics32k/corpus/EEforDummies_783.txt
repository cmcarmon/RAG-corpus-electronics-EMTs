Collecting wires into cables or cords
Cables are groups of two or more wires protected by an outer layer of insula-
tion. Line cords that bring AC power from a wall outlet to an electrical device 
such as a lamp are cables â€” so are the cords in the mishmash of connec-
tions in your home entertainment system. Cables differ from stranded wires 
because the wires used in cables are separated by insulation.
