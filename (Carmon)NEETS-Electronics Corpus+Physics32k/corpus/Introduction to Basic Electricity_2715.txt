Inductive circuits are widely used in electronics. 
 Inductors compete with capacitors for filtering and 
phase-shift applications. Because inductors are larger, 
heavier, and more expensive than capacitors, they have 
fewer applications than capacitors. However, inductors 
have the advantage of providing a reactive effect while 
still completing a DC circuit path. Capacitors can pro-
vide a reactive effect but block the DC elements.
