Chapter 1 states that a fiber optic data link performs three basic functions. First, the data link
transmitter converts an electrical input signal to an optical signal. Then, the optical fiber transmits this
optical signal. Finally, the data link receiver converts the optical signal back to an electrical signal
identical to the original input. However, chapter 1 does not describe how optical power transfers from one
optical component to another.
