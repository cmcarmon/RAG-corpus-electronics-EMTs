Both the memory allocation and the signal-to-memory as-
signment have to take into account the constraints generated
by the SCBD tool to meet the real-time requirements. For the
memory allocation,
this means that a certain minimum
number of memories is needed (again, for multiport memo-
ries, the situation is more complicated). This minimum is
derived from the conﬂict graph’s chromatic number and
is also indicated in Figure 2.23. For the signal-to-memory
assignment, conﬂicting arrays cannot be assigned to the same
memory. When there is a conﬂict between two arrays that in
the optimal assignment were stored in the same memory, a less
efﬁcient assignment must be accepted. Thus, more conﬂicts
make the memory organization potentially more expensive.
