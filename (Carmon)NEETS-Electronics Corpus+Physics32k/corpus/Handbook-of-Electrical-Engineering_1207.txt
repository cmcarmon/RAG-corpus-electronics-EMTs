and we will refer to PC  as the projection operator onto the closed convex set C. It is important to note that if
the closed convex set C is not a subspace or a linear variety, then this associated projection operator is no longer
linear. Moreover, if x ˛  C, then PC x =  x, so that every vector of  C is a ﬁxed point of operator PC .5 Thus, the
ﬁxed points of PC and the closed convex set  C are equivalent. These concepts were used by Bregman [1965]
and  others  to  prove  a  type  of  convergence  of  the  successive  projection  algorithm.  The  following  theorem
summarizes their results.
