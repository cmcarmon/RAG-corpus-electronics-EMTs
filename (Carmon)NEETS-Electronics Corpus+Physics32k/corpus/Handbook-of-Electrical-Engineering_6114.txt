Optimal power system operation requires the best use of resources subject to a number of constraints over
any  speciﬁed  time  period.  The  problem  consists  of  minimizing  a  scalar  objective  function  (normally  a  cost
criterion)  through  the  optimal  control  of  a  vector  of  control  parameters.  This  is  subject  to  the  equality
constraints of the load ﬂow equations, inequality constraints on the control parameters, and inequality con-
straints of dependent variables and dependent functions. The programs to do this analysis are usually referred
to as optimal power ﬂow (OPF) programs.
