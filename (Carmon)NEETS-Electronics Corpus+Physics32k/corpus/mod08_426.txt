Earlier NEETS modules state that the inductance of a coil increases directly as the permeability of
the core material increases. If a coil is wound around an iron core, the permeability of the core is 5000.
Now, if the iron is pulled part way out of the coil of wire, the core is part iron and part air. The
permeability of the core decreases. As the permeability of the core decreases, the inductance of the coil
decreases. This increases the power delivered to the load (true power). This relationship is shown in
figure 3-30.
