Customer taps along the feeder draw current through the line,
causing the voltage to drop as one gets further from the
substation. If the voltage at the substation is set at the nominal
voltage, the consumers at the end of the feeder have too low
a voltage under peak load. If the voltage is set so that con-
sumers at the end of the feeder receive the nominal voltage
under heavy load, the consumers near the substation have too
high a voltage, and the voltage is too high for all of the
consumers at light load. Therefore, a compromise voltage
setting must be chosen so that the voltage is at an acceptable
level for all consumers regardless of the load, and the line drop
must be acceptably low under all load conditions. However, a
favorable compromise of voltage drop and voltage settings is
not always possible for all load conditions, so other means of
voltage regulation have been devised for such conditions.
