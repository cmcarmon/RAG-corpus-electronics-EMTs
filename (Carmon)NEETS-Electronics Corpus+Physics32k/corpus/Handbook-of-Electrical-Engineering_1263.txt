Example 6. We will now illustrate the point that the sequence of vectors generated by the successive projections
algorithm need not always converge to the closest vector in a closed convex set. This will be accomplished by
considering  the  task  of  ﬁnding  a  positive-semideﬁnite  Toeplitz  matrix  that  lies  closest  to  given  matrix.  The
given matrix X is here taken to be
