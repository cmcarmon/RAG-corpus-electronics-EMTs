In the absence of an electric ﬁeld, electrons in a semiconductor
move randomly because of thermal motion. The average vel-
ocity of this motion is called thermal velocity. An electric ﬁeld
accelerates electrons and causes a component of the electron
velocity to go in the direction of the electric ﬁeld. This velocity
of the directed electronic motion in the electric ﬁeld is called
the drift velocity. This drift velocity results in an electric
current.
