11. Plasma displays have a high input impedance characteristic that makes them easy to drive. The dielectric
constant of the gas is equal to one, which means that plasma displays have virtually the lowest possible
electrode capacitance. This is 1000 times smaller than electroluminescent displays and about 100 times
smaller than liquid crystal displays. This translates to lower current requirements and, therefore, smaller
drive  circuit  silicon  area  for  the  plasma  displays.  While  plasma  displays  do  require  100-volt  address
drivers, it is frequently easier to design high voltage circuits than high current circuits. Also, 40-in. and
larger displays can be designed with little power dissipation in panel electrodes.
