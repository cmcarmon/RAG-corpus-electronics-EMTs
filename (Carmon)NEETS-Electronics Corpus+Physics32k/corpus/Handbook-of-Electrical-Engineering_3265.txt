Phase Velocity
In isotropic media light propagates as transverse electromagnetic (TEM) waves. The electric and magnetic Ô¨Åeld
vectors  are  perpendicular  to  the  propagation  direction  and  orthogonal  to  each  other.  The  velocity  of  light
propagation in a medium (the velocity of planes of constant phase, i.e., wavefronts) is given by
