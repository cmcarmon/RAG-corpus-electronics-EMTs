ROTORÂ—(1) The revolving part of a rotating electrical machine. The rotor may be either the field or the 
armature, depending on the design of the machine [5]. (2) The rotating member of a synchro that 
consists of one or more coils of wire wound on a laminated core. Depending on the type of synchro, the 
rotor functions similarly to the primary or secondary winding of a transformer [15].
