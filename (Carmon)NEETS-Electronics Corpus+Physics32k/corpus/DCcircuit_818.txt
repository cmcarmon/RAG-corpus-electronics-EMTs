Knowing that the left side of the null detector must connect to the two near ends of Ra
and Rx in order to avoid introducing those Ewire voltage drops into the null detectorâ€™s loop, and
that any direct wire connecting those ends of Ra and Rx will itself carry substantial current and
create more stray voltage drops, the only way out of this predicament is to make the connecting
path between the lower end of Ra and the upper end of Rx substantially resistive:
