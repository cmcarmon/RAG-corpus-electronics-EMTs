A mathematical model of the physical process that needs to be
controlled is needed for control system design and analysis. This
model could be derived from ﬁrst principles, obtained via system
identiﬁcation, or created by one engineer and then given to
another. Regardless of the origin of the model, the control
engineer needs to completely understand it and its limitations.
In some processes, it is possible to consider models with a single
input and output (SISO) for which a vast amount of literature is
available. In many other cases, it is necessary to consider models
with multiple inputs and/or outputs (MIMO). This chapter
presents a selection of modeling, analysis, and design topics for
multivariable, ﬁnite-dimensional, causal, linear, time-invariant
systems that generalize the results for SISO systems. The reader is
encouraged to consult the references at the end of this chapter for
additional topics in multivariable control systems and for the
proofs to the lemmas and theorems presented.
