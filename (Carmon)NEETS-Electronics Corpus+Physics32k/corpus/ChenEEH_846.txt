Technically, the clock skew TSkew (i, j) can be calculated for any
ordered pair of registers hRi, Rji. However, the clock skew
between a nonsequential pair of registers has little practical
value. The clock skew TSkew (i, j) between sequentially adjacent
pairs of registers Ri?Rj (that is, a local data path) is of
primary practical importance since TSkew(i, j) is part of the
timing constraints of these paths (Friedman, 1995, 1990;
Afghani and Svensson, 1990; Unger and Tan, 1986; Kourtev,
1999; Kourtev and Friedman, 1996).
