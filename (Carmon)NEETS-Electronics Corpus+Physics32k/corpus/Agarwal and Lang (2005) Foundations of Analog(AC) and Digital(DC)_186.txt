From the viewpoint of circuit analysis, the most important characteristic of a
two-terminal element is the relation between the voltage across and the current
through its terminals, or the v i relationship for short. This relation, called
the element law, represents the lumped-parameter summary of the electronic
behavior of the element. for example, as seen in Equation 1.15,
