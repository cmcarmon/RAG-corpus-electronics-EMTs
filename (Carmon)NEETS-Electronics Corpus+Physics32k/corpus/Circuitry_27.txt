Voltage and resistance 
 
The  ability  of  an  energy  source  (e.g.  a  battery)  to 
produce  a  current  within  a  conductor  may  be 
expressed in terms of electromotive force (e.m.f.). 
Whenever  an  e.m.f.  is  applied  to  a  circuit  a
potential  difference  (p.d.) exists. Both e.m.f. and 
p.d.  are  measured  in  volts  (V).  In  many  practical 
circuits there is only one e.m.f. present (the battery 
or supply) whereas a p.d. will be developed across 
each component present in the circuit. 
  The conventional  flow of current in a circuit is 
from  the  point  of  more  positive  potential  to  the 
point  of  greatest  negative  potential  (note  that 
electrons  move  in  the  opposite  direction!).  Direct 
current  results  from  the  application  of  a  direct 
e.m.f.  (derived  from  batteries  or  a  d.c.  power 
supply).  An  essential  characteristic  of 
these 
supplies is that the applied e.m.f. does not change 
its polarity (even though its value might be subject 
to some fluctuation). 
  For any conductor, the current flowing is directly 
proportional  to  the  e.m.f.  applied.  The  current 
flowing  will  also  be  dependent  on  the  physical 
dimensions  (length  and  cross-sectional  area)  and 
material of which the conductor is composed.  
  The  amount  of  current  that  will  flow  in  a 
conductor  when  a  given  e.m.f.  is  applied  is 
inversely proportional to its resistance. Resistance, 
therefore,  may  be  thought  of  as  an  opposition  to 
current flow; the higher the resistance the lower the 
current  that  will  flow  (assuming  that  the  applied 
e.m.f. remains constant).
