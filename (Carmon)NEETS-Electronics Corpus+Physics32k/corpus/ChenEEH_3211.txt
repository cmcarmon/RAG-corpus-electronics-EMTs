The subtransmission system is the part of the power system
that delivers power from bulk-power sources, such as large
transmission substations. The subtransmission may be com-
posed of overhead open-wire construction on wood poles or
underground cables. Although the voltages of these circuits
can occasionally range from 12.47 to 345 kV, the majority are
at 69-, 115-, and 138-kV voltage levels. There is a trend toward
the use of the higher voltages as a result of increasing use of
the higher transmission voltages. The subtransmission-system
designs vary from simple radial-type and/or loop-type systems
to a grid- or network-type subtransmission. In the radial
