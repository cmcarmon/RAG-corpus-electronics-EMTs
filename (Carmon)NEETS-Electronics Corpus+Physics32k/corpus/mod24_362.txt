While index matching gel reduces coupling loss from fiber separation, it does not affect loss in
lateral misalignment. Additionally, index matching gel usually increases the fiber's coupling loss
sensitivity to angular misalignment. Although angular misalignment involves fiber separation, index
matching gel reduces the angle at which light is launched from the source fiber. Index matching gel
causes less light to be coupled into the receiving fiber. To reduce coupling loss from angular
misalignment, the angle Q should be less than 1ยบ.
