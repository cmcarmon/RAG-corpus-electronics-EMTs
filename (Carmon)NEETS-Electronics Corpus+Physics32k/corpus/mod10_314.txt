All radio waves propagated over ionospheric paths undergo energy losses before arriving at the 
receiving site. As we discussed earlier, absorption in the ionosphere and lower atmospheric levels account 
for a large part of these energy losses. There are two other types of losses that also significantly affect the 
ionospheric propagation of radio waves. These losses are known as ground reflection loss and free space 
loss. The combined effects of absorption, ground reflection loss, and free space loss account for most of 
the energy losses of radio transmissions propagated by the ionosphere.
