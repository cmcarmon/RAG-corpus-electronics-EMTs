The oscilloscope is widely used as an amplitude-modulation monitor and measuring instrument. 
Since it is capable of presenting visual indications of the modulated output of AM transmitters, the 
oscilloscope is reliable for detecting overmodulation and determining the percentage of modulation. For 
example, the relative error of most measurements taken with a 5-inch crt is about 10%. Although such 
accuracy is adequate for many maintenance checks, the oscilloscope is usually considered more valuable 
as a monitor of general modulation conditions. It is also used to monitor the amplitude-modulated output 
of a radio transmitter when photographic records are desired.
