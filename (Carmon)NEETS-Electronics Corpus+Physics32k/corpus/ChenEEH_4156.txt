. Frequency shift keying (FSK): In this technique, the two
binary values are represented by two different frequencies.
In the full duplex FSK, one set of frequencies could be
designated for one direction of the communication, while
the other set could be designated for an opposite direction
of the communication. For example, a set of frequencies
(1070 Hz, 1270 Hz) is used for one direction of the com-
munication, and the other set (2070 Hz, 2075 Hz) is used
for other direction of the communication.
