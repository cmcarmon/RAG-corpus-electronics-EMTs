Another example of convective overshoot is at the base of the convection zone in the solar interior. The heat of the Sun's thermonuclear fusion is carried outward by radiation in the deep interior radiation zone and by convective circulation in the outer convection zone, but cool sinking material from the surface penetrates farther into the radiative zone than theory would suggest. This affects the heat transfer rate and the temperature of the solar interior which can be indirectly measured by helioseismology. The layer between the Sun's convective and radiative zone is called the tachocline.
Overshooting in the convective core of more massive stars is critical to the modelling of evolution beyond the main sequence. Overshooting causes the core mass at the end of the main sequence to be larger than would otherwise be expected. This leads to big differences in behaviour on the subgiant and giant branches for intermediate mass stars, and to radical changes in the evolution of massive supergiant stars.
