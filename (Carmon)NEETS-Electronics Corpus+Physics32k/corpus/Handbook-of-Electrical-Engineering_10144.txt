Similar  considerations  apply  for  other  disturbances  such  as  frictional  torques  and  gravitational  torques.
Notice  from  Eq. (101.18)  that  the  feedforward  signal  is  a  function  of  the  estimated  torque.  The  burden  of
determining these torques should not be underestimated. The other factor that was not mentioned earlier is
the  centrifugal  torque,  a  nonlinear  function  of  velocity.  In  the  case  of  positioning  applications,  the  velocity
tends to zero as t ﬁ ¥. However, if the robot is required to follow a conveyor with constant speed, then the
input is a velocity. In this case, the centrifugal contribution will affect the steady-state velocity error. A feed-
forward compensation can be used in this case as well. Another method of compensating for the steady-state
errors caused by gravitational and load torque disturbances is by adding an integral feedback (PID control),
which of course increases the order of the system. The system is no longer stable for all values of the gains and
thus adds another constraint in the selection of Ka and Kv.
