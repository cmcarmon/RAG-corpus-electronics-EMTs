The wall luminance coefﬁcient and the ceiling cavity luminance coefﬁcient are selected for the appropriate
room cavity ratio and proper wall and ceiling cavity reﬂectances from the table of luminance coefﬁcients in
the same manner as the coefﬁcient of utilization. The room position multiplier is a function of the room cavity
ratio and of the location in the room of the point where the illumination is desired. Table 107.6 lists the value
of the RPM for each possible location of the part in the rooms of all room cavity ratios.
