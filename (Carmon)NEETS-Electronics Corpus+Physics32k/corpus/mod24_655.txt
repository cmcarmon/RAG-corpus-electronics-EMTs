The demand for optical sources for longer distance, higher bandwidth systems operating at longer
wavelengths led to the development of edge-emitting LEDs. Figure 6-2 shows a typical ELED structure.
It shows the different layers of semiconductor material used in the ELED. The primary active region of
the ELED is a narrow stripe, which lies below the surface of the semiconductor substrate. The
semiconductor substrate is cut or polished so that the stripe runs between the front and back of the device.
The polished or cut surfaces at each end of the stripe are called facets.
