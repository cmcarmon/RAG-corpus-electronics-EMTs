Tropical Storm Watch – Issued when a tropical storm or tropical storm conditions pose a threat to coastal areas generally within 36 hours. A watch will generally cover a larger threat area than a warning, as the uncertainty on the track of the storm is greater.
Tropical Storm Warning – Issued when winds of 63 to 117 km/h (39 to 73 mph; 34 to 63 kn) are expected. Warnings are not issued more than 24 hours in advance.
Hurricane Watch – Issued when a hurricane approaches the mainland and is considered a threat to coastal and inland regions.
Hurricane Warning – Issued for coastal waters where winds greater than 117 km/h (73 mph; 63 kn) are expected. It may also include areas where storm surge or exceptionally high waves are predicted, even though winds may be less than hurricane force. Warnings are not issued more than 24 hours in advance. If the path is erratic or if the hurricane undergoes a transition into a post-tropical system, the warning may only be issued a few hours in advance. Almost always accompanied by a Wind Warning.
Storm Surge Warning – Issued when a storm surge and/or high waves may result in significant flooding in coastal areas. Sometimes issued during strong Nor'easters or other non-tropical storms.
