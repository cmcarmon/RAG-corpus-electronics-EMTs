From an engineering viewpoint one can judge the accuracy of DF results by estimating the distortion, d, in
the input to the nonlinearity. This is straightforward when a limit-cycle solution is given by the DF method;
the loop may be considered opened at the nonlinearity input, the sinusoidal signal corresponding to the DF
solution can be applied to the nonlinearity, and the harmonic content of the signal fed back to the nonlinearity
input can be calculated. Experience indicates that the percentage accuracy of the DF method in predicting the
fundamental amplitude and frequency of the limit cycle is less than the percentage distortion in the fedback
signal. As mentioned previously, the DF method may incorrectly predict stability. To investigate this problem,
the  procedure  above  can  be  used  again,  by  taking,  as  the  nonlinearity  input,  a  sinusoid  with  amplitude  and
frequency corresponding to values of those parameters where the phase margin is small. If the calculated fedback
distortion is high, say greater than 2% per degree of phase margin, the DF result should not be relied on.
