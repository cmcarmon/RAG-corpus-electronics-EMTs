Before any measurements of receiver sensitivity can be made, the receiver must be accurately tuned 
to the transmitter frequency. If the receiver frequency differs from the transmitter frequency, the most 
likely cause is an improperly adjusted or malfunctioning local oscillator or transmitter frequency drift. 
Such problems can be caused by heat or aging components. Local oscillator tuning procedures differ 
widely according to the type of radar system; therefore, you should follow the tuning procedures in the 
system maintenance manuals.
