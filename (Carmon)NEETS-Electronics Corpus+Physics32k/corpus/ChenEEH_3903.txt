Given the variation descriptions for describing different vari-
ations of the media resources, the overall number of different
variations of each variation document is combinatorial in the
number of media resources (N) and number of variations of
each media resource (M) and is given by M N. To solve the
optimization problems of equations 5.1 and 5.2 convert the
constrained optimization problems
equivalent
Lagrangian unconstrained problems, as described in Mohan
et al. (1998).
