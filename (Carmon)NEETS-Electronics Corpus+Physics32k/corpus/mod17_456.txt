Most studies on the subject of radiation hazards (RADHAZ) have emphasized the impact of 
electromagnetic radiation on man. Man is singled out because of the biological, thermal, and neurological 
effects that occur in human organs and other biological tissues. Certain organs of the body are considered 
to be more susceptible than others to the effects of electromagnetic radiation. Presently available 
information and experience indicate that the eyes and testes are the most vulnerable body organs. The 
overwhelming danger to date appears to be the hazard from thermal effects, which are a function of 
intensity of radiation and frequency. This is particularly true in the range of 1 to 3 gigahertz. Thermal 
effects appear to taper off in severity outside this range.
