During the negative alternation of the input signal (T1 to T2), the diode is forward biased and 
conducts. The relatively low forward bias of D1 develops a very small voltage and, therefore, limits the 
output to nearly 0 volts. A voltage is developed across the resistor as current flows through the resistor 
and diode.
