The U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency published design guidelines for vertical evacuation structures in 2008. According to the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, serious discussions about vertical evacuation began in the United States following the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. The American Society of Civil Engineers adopted an updated edition of its building standards in September 2016, including tsunami hazards for the first time.
The first vertical evacuation site in the United States was Ocosta Elementary School, constructed in 2015–2016 on the Pacific Ocean coast in Westport, Washington, where a Cascadia subduction zone magnitude 9+ earthquake is expected to cause great tsunamis.
