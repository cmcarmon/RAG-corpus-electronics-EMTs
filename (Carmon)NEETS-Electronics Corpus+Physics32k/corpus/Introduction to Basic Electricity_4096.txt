Figure 40-11 shows a differentiator circuit. Recall 
that complex waveforms are made of the fundamen-
tal frequency plus a large number of harmonics. When 
a complex waveform is applied to a differentiator, 
each frequency is affected differently. The ratio of the 
 capacitive reactance (XC) to R is different for each har-
monic. This results in each harmonic being shifted in 
phase and reduced in amplitude by a different amount. 
The net result is distortion of the original waveform. 
Figure 40-12 shows what happens to a square wave 
 applied to a differentiator. Figure 40-13 shows the 
 effects of different RC time constants.
