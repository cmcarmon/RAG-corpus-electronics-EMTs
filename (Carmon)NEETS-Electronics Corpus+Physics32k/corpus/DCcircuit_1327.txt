Once again, due to the natural retentivity of the material, it will hold a magnetic ﬂux with
no power applied to the coil, except this time its in a direction opposite to that of the last time
we stopped current through the coil. If we re-apply power in a positive direction again, we
should see the ﬂux density reach its prior peak in the upper-right corner of the graph again:
