We can solve the inverse dynamics of a system to obtain joint torques and nonetheless be unable to estimate the forces exerted by single muscles even knowing the exact geometry of our joints and muscles due to the redundancy of our system. Through an optimization approach we could find a way to understand how our central nervous system chooses its control strategies so as to optimize some aspects of movement production (e.g. minimizing metabolic cost).
