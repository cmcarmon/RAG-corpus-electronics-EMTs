â€¢ Negative resistance is where the current through a component actually decreases as the
applied voltage across it is increased. Some electron tubes and semiconductor diodes
(most notably, the tetrode tube and the Esaki, or tunnel diode, respectively) exhibit nega-
tive resistance over a certain range of voltages.
