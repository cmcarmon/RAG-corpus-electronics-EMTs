Amode filter is a device that attenuates specific modes propagating in the core of an optical fiber.
Mode filters generally involve wrapping the test fiber around a mandrel. For multimode, tight bends tend
to remove high-order modes from the fiber. This type of mode filter is known as amandrel wrap mode
filter. For multimode fibers, mode filters remove high-order propagating modes and are individually
tailored and adjusted for a specific fiber type.
