KVL states that the algebraic sum of the voltages (drops or rises) encountered in traversing
any loop (which is a closed path through a circuit in which no electric element or node is
encountered more than once) of a circuit in a speciﬁed direction must be zero. In other words, the
sum of the voltage rises is equal to the sum of the voltage drops in a loop. A loop that contains no
other loops is known as a mesh. KVL implies that moving charge around a path and returning to the
starting point should require no net expenditure of energy. Figure 1.3.2 illustrates the Kirchhoff’s
voltage law.
