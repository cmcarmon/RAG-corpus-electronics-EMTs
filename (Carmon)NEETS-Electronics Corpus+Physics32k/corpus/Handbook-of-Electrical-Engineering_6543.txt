ﬁber decreases with its length, so that the ﬁber itself limits the rate-length product. The losses in the system,
including those in the ﬁber, also limit the path length. Systems are bandwidth limited if the rate-length ﬁgure
is determined by bandwidth restraints and loss limited if determined by attenuation.
