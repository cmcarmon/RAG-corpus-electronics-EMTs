All of this information may seem very discouraging, but,
fortunately, synthesis of completely arbitrary impedances is
almost never needed. In most cases, we need to realize LC
impedances (admittances), and the rules are considerably sim-
pliÔ¨Åed here. Again, without trying to provide a proof, let us
state that any LC impedance can be realized in the form of the
circuit in Figure 4.23(A) and any LC admittance in the form of
the network in Figure 4.23(B).
