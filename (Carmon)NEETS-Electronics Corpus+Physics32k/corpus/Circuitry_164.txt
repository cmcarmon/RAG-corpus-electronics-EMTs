In order to simplify the mathematics of exponential 
growth and decay, Table 3.1 provides an alternative 
tabular  method  that  may  be  used  to  determine  the 
voltage and current in a C–R circuit. 
 
Example 3.12 
 
A 150  µF  capacitor  is  charged  to  a  potential  of  
150  V.  The  capacitor  is  then  removed  from  the 
charging source and connected to a 2 MF resistor. 
Determine the capacitor voltage 1 minute later. 
 
Solution 
 
We  will solve this problem using Table 3.1 rather 
than the exponential formula. 
  First we need to find the time constant: 
 
C × R = 150 µF × 2 MF = 300 s 
 
Next we find the ratio of  t to CR:
