Regardless of what type of transistor is employed, 
three  basic    circuit  configurations  are  used.  These 
three circuit configurations depend upon which one 
of the three transistor connections is made common 
to  both  the  input  and  the  output.  In  the  case  of 
bipolar transistors, the configurations are known as 
common  emitter, common  collector  (or  emitter 
follower) and  common  base. Where  field  effect
