S1 Closed, S2 Open During this initial interval, because S1 is closed and S2 is open,
the DC voltage V appears directly across the inductor, and the inductor current iL ramps
up. This aspect of charge pump operation has already been analyzed in Subsection 9.4.2.
In particular, if we define t = 0 to occur at the beginning of a cycle, then iL is given by
Equation 9.78 for 0 ≤ t ≤ T. Thus, iL builds up as a ramp.
Now suppose that we wish to find the capacitor voltage vC at the end of the nth cycle.
This is most easily done through energy considerations. From Equation 9.36 we see that
