Before we begin our analysis of nonlinear resistors, we will describe as examples
several nonlinear resistive devices, by their v i characteristics, just as we did for
the resistor, the battery, etc. The first of the nonlinear devices that we discuss is
the diode. Figure 4.1 shows the symbol for a diode. The diode is a two-terminal,
nonlinear resistor whose current is exponentially related to the voltage across
its terminals.
An analytical expression for the nonlinear relation between the voltage vD and
the current iD for the diode is the following:
