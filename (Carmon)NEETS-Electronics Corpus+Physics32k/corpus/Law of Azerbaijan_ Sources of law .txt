Unlike common law systems such as the United States and United Kingdom, Azerbaijani courts do not rely extensively on case law and judicial precedent. Except for decisions of the Constitutional Court of Azerbaijan, decisions of the courts are not usually counted as a source of law. The sources of law in the Azerbaijani legal system are:
The Constitution of Azerbaijan.
Acts adopted via referendum.
Laws passed by the National Assembly of Azerbaijan, Azerbaijan's legislature.
Decrees.
Resolutions of the Cabinet of Ministers.
International treaties to which Azerbaijan is a party.
