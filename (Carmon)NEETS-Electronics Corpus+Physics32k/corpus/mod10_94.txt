the transfer of energy. To produce vibrations that become sounds, a mechanical device (the source) must
first receive an input of energy. Next, the device must be in contact with a medium that will receive the
sound energy and carry it to a receiver. If the device is not in contact with a medium, the energy will not
be transferred to a receiver, and there will be no sound.
