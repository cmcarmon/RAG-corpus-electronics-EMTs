The current through one branch of this junction goes through R5  and back to the source. (The most
direct path.) Now that you have completed a path for current to the source, return to the last junction, (b).
Follow current through the other branch from this junction. Current flows from junction (b) through R4 to
the source. All the paths from junction (b) have been traced. Only one path from junction (a) has been
completed. You must now return to junction (a) to complete the other two paths. From junction (a) the
current flows through R7 back to the source. (There are no additional branches on this path.) Return to
junction (a) to trace the third path from this junction. Current flows through R6  and R8 and comes to a
junction. Label this junction (c). From junction (c) one path for current is through R9  to the source. The
other path for current from junction (c) is through R10 to the source. All the junctions in this circuit have
