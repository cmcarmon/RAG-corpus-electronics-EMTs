Switching techniques avoid direct connections between any
two computers on a network. These techniques not only save
the cost of transmission links but also provide the ï¬‚exible
and reliable connections between any two computers on the
network. There are two major switching techniques: one is
mainly used in the telephone network, and the other is used
in data and other telecommunication networks. The message
switching is rarely used, but it is described here for complete-
ness.
