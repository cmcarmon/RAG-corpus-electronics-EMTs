In considering LED effectiveness for display purposes, one must also include radiation wavelength in relation
to the spectral response of the human eye [Sze, 1985]. Although the GaP green LED is intrinsically less efﬁcient
than the GaAsP red LED, the eye compensates for the deﬁciency with a greater sensitivity to green.
