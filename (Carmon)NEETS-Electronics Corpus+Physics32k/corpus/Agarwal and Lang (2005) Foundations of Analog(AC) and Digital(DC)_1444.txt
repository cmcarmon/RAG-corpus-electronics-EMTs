It might at first appear that to perform this integral we need to know the
complete current waveform from t = −∞. Not so. All we need is the charge
(or voltage, since q = Cv) at one time, and the current waveform thereafter.
If the charge at t1 is q(t1) then from Equation 10.77 the charge at some time t2
