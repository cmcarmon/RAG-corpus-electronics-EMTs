Lemma 1. Let Vk = uk + Ck be closed linear varieties associated with the closed subspaces Ck and vectors uk
contained in Hilbert space  X for k = 1, 2,  …,  m. Moreover, let V designate the nonempty closed linear variety
formed by the intersection of these closed linear varieties so that V = V 1˙ V 2˙ …  ˙Vm. Corresponding to
any vector x ˛  X, the vector contained in V that lies closest to x in the inner product-induced sense is the limit
of the sequence generated according to
