From our limiting interpretation of the impulse we now see that v in Equation 9.91 is a
voltage that instantaneously delivers the flux linkage LIâ—¦ to the inductor at t = 0. Thus,
the flux linked by the inductor takes a step at t = 0, and so the current steps too as
driven by the source. This illustrates an important point made earlier, namely that it takes
an infinite voltage to cause the flux linked by, and hence the current passing through,
an inductor to take a discontinuous step. Thus, except under unusual circumstances
involving infinite voltages, the state of an inductor is a continuous function of time.
