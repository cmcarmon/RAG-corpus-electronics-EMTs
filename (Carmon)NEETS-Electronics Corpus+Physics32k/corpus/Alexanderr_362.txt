7.6
Consider the RL circuit in Fig. 7.48(a), which may be replaced by the
circuit in Fig. 7.48(b). Again, our goal is to ﬁnd the inductor current i
as the circuit response. Rather than apply Kirchhoff’s laws, we will use
the simple technique in Eqs. (7.50) through (7.53). Let the response be
the sum of the transient response and the steady-state response,
