In quantum physics, the mathematical notion is usually applied to the mathematical structure of gauge algebras. Quantization provides a correspondence between symmetries of gauged structures and particles. Thus, a multiplet has also come to describe the subatomic particles described by these representations.
Multiplet may also describe a group of related spectral lines.
