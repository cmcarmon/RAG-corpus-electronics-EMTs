Figure 3-20 shows a continuity test of a cable that connects two electronic units. Notice that both
plugs are disconnected and the ohmmeter is in series with conductor D under test. The power should be
off. When checking conductors A, B, and C (connection of ohmmeter to conductors not shown), the
current from the ohmmeter flows through plug 2 (female) through conductor A, B, or C to plug 1
(female). From plug 1, current passes through the jumper to the chassis, which is "grounded" to the shipâ€™s
structure. The metal structure serves as the return path to the chassis of unit 2 and completes the circuit
through the series-connected ohmmeter. The ohmmeter indicates a low resistance because no break exists
in conductors A, B, or C. However, checking conductor D reveals an open. The ohmmeter is shown
indicating maximum resistance because current cannot flow in an open circuit. With an open circuit, the
ohmmeter needle is all the way to the left since it is a series-type ohmmeter (reads right to left).
