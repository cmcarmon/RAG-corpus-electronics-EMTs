†^ Particle has not yet been observed.[a] ^ The masses of the proton and neutron are known with much better precision in atomic mass units (u) than in MeV/c2, due to the relatively poorly known value of the elementary charge. In atomic mass units, the mass of the proton is 1.007276466812(90) u whereas that of the neutron is 1.00866491600(43) u.[b] ^ At least 1035 years. See proton decay.[c] ^ For free neutrons; in most common nuclei, neutrons are stable.[d] ^ PDG reports the resonance width (Γ). Here the conversion τ = ​ħ⁄Γ is given instead.[e] ^ There is a controversial discovery claim, disfavored by other experimental data.
