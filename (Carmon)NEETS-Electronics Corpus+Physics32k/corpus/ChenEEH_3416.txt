Further discussion of the speciﬁc relaying principles will be
given later. In general, the relay action is based on a compari-
son between the measured quantity and the operating charac-
teristic. Once the characteristic thresholds (settings) are
exceeded, the relay assumes that this is caused by the faults
affecting the measuring quantity, and it issues a command to
operate associated circuit breaker(s). This action is commonly
termed as a relay tripping, meaning opening a circuit breaker.
The relays may come in different designs and implementa-
tion technologies. The number of different designs at the early
days when the relaying was invented was rather small, and the
main technology was the electromechanical one. Today’s
design options are much wider with a number of different
