 Electrical inductance is like mechanical inertia, and the growth of current in an inductive circuit can 
be likened to the acceleration of a boat on the surface of the water. The boat does not move at the instant a 
constant force is applied to it. At this instant all the applied force is used to overcome the inertia of the 
boat. Once the inertia is overcome the boat will start to move. After a while, the speed of the boat reaches 
its maximum value and the applied force is used up in overcoming the friction of the water against the 
hull.
