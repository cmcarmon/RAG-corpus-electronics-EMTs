Power MOSFETs are majority carrier devices, and there is no
minority carrier storage time. Hence they have exceptionally fast
rise  and  fall  times.  They  are  essentially  resistive  devices  when
turned on, while bipolar transistors present a more or less con-
 over the normal operating range. Power dissipation

currents, therefore, a power MOSFET may have a lower conduc-
tion  loss  than  a  comparable  bipolar  device,  but  at  higher  cur-
rents, the conduction loss will exceed that of bipolars. Also, the
