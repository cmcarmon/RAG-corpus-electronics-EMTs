With  the  pursuit  system  organization  the  error  can  be  reduced  by  the  humanâ€™s  operations  in  two  ways:  by
making the open-loop describing function large compared with 1 and by generating a pursuit path describing
function  which  tends  to  be  the  inverse  of  the  controlled  element.  This  can,  of  course,  only  be  done  over  a
limited range of frequencies. The quality of the overall control in the pursuit case can, in principle, be much
superior to that where only compensatory operations are possible.
