Mapping of equation 1.1 is of practical interest because it can
simplify certain arithmetic operations (i.e., it can reduce the
implementation complexity, also called strength, of several
operators). For example, due to the properties of the logarithm
function, the multiplication of two linear numbers, X ¼ bx
and Y ¼ by, is reduced to the addition of their logarithmic
images, x and y.
