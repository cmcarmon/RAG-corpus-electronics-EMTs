2.6.6 Linear Systems
Linear systems are a class of systems rather than having a speciﬁc input-output relation. Linear systems
form the foundation of system theory, and are the most important class of systems in communications. They
have the property that when the input is expressed as a weighted sum of component signals, the output
equals the same weighted sum of the outputs produced by each component. When S [·] is linear,
