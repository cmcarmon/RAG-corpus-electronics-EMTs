levels and variations of multimedia content. For example, the
different abstraction levels include the composition of objects
from sub-objects, the extraction of plot structure of a video,
summaries of multimedia programs, and different variations
of the multimedia data with different resource requirements.
In addition, MPEG-7 supports the transcoding, translation,
summarization, and adaptation of multimedia material
according to the capabilities of the client devices, network
resources, and user and author preferences. For example, adap-
tation hints may be provided that indicate how a photograph
should be compressed to adapt it for a handheld computer or
how a video should be summarized to speed up browsing over
a low-bandwidth network (Smith et al., 1998a).
