When cable supports are used in equipment as shown in figure 2-48, spot ties are used to secure the 
conductor groups if the supports are more than 12 inches apart. The spot ties are made by wrapping the 
cord around the group as shown in figure 2-49. To finish the tie, use a clove hitch followed by a square 
knot with an extra loop. The free ends of the cord are then trimmed to a minimum of 3/8 inch.
