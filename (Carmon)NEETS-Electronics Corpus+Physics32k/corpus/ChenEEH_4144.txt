The received signal has Rayleigh fading statistics. But what are
the characteristics of the x and y terms in equation 4.45? If the
transmitter signal is narrow enough compared to the ﬁne
multipath structure of the channel, then the individual fading
components, xi(t) and yi(t ) will also have Rayleigh statistics. If
a particular path is dominated by a reﬂection off of a moun-
tain, hill, building, or similar structure, then the statistics of
that path may be Rician rather than Raleigh. If the range of ti
is small compared to the bit interval, then little distortion of
the received signal occurs. If the range of ti is greater than a bit
interval, then the transmissions from one bit will interfere with
the transmissions of another bit. This effect is called inter-
symbol interference.
