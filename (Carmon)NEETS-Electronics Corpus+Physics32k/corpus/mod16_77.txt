If you are unable to replace a known failed component with onboard spares, you can often locate the
replacement component from other supply sources. The replacement component can then be delivered,
along with the inoperative equipment, to the IMA. So by sending the repair part along with the
equipment, you can reduce repair time considerably. This is particularly true when your unit is getting
under way and no time is available for you to complete the repair before calibration. Most operational
commands have a higher supply priority for purchase of repair parts than the IMA can use.
