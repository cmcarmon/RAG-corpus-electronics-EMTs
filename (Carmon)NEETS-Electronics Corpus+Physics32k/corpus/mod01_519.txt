To state Kirchhoffâ€™s law another way, the voltage drops and voltage sources in a circuit are equal at
any given moment in time. If the voltage sources are assumed to have one sign (positive or negative) at
that instant and the voltage drops are assumed to have the opposite sign, the result of adding the voltage
sources and voltage drops will be zero.
