particular circuit (which is why pins 11, 12, and 13 are not used). Whether 
the schematic uses individual gates or an entire IC package, it usually notes 
the external power connections. If it doesn’t, you have to look up the pinout 
of the device on the IC datasheet to determine how to connect power. (For 
more about pinouts and datasheets, see Chapter 11.)
