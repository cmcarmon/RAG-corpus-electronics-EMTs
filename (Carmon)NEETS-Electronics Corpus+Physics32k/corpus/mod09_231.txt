The amplifier supplies energy to begin what is known as the FLYWHEEL EFFECT. The flywheel 
effect is the maintenance of oscillations in a circuit in the intervals between pulses of excitation energy. 
Recall that in chapter 1 the tank circuit alternately stored energy in the inductor and capacitor. The LC 
network provides initial oscillations. A portion of the output of the LC network is then returned to the 
input of the amplifier through the regenerative-feedback network to sustain the oscillations.
