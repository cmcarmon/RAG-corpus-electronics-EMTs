Within a few years after the discovery of the Edison effect, scientists had learned a great deal more
than Edison knew at the time of his discovery. By the early 1900s, J.J. Thomson in England had
discovered the electron. Marconi, in Italy and England, had demonstrated the wireless, which was to
become the radio. The theoretical knowledge of the nature of electricity and things electrical was
increasing at a rapid rate.
