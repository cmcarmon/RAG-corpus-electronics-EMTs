There is a large difference in conjugate depths in a strong jump. Strong jumps are characterized by a jump action that is very rough resulting in a high energy dissipation rate. At irregular intervals, slugs of water can be seen rolling down the front of the jump face. These slugs enter the high-velocity, supercritical jet and cause the formation of additional waves in the jump. Energy dissipation in strong jumps can reach up to 85%.
