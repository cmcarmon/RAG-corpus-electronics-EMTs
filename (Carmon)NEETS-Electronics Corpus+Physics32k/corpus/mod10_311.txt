Multipath fading may be minimized by practices called SPACE DIVERSITY and FREQUENCY 
DIVERSITY. In space diversity, two or more receiving antennas are spaced some distance apart. Fading 
does not occur simultaneously at both antennas; therefore, enough output is almost always available from 
one of the antennas to provide a useful signal. In frequency diversity, two transmitters and two receivers 
are used, each pair tuned to a different frequency, with the same information being transmitted 
simultaneously over both frequencies. One of the two receivers will almost always provide a useful 
signal.
