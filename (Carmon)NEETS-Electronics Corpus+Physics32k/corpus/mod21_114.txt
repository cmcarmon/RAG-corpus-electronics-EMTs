Ac and dc CURRENT MEASUREMENTS can be performed using a wide variety of test equipment.
Most current measurements require you to break the current path by unsoldering components and wires
and inserting an ammeter in series with the current path. One alternative method is to compute (using
OHMâ€™S LAW) the current through a circuit by measuring the voltage drop across a known resistance.
Another alternative is to use a CURRENT PROBE that requires no unsoldering.
