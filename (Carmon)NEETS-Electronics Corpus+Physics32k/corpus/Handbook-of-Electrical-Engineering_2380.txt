where  m∗  is  the  effective  mass,  veq  is  the  velocity  at  equilibrium  (steady  state),  and  τ  is  the  velocity  (or
momentum) relaxation time (i.e., the time in which oscillatory phase information is lost through collisions).
Consider a rectangular sample, as shown in Fig. 22.35(a), with an external electric ﬁeld Eex = Exx and magnetic
ﬁeld  B =  Bzz.  (Dimensions  x  and  y  are  parallel  to “ᐉ”  and “w,”  respectively,  and  z  is  perpendicular  to  both.)
Then, if no current is allowed to ﬂow in the y direction (i.e., vy = 0), the steady-state condition ·ν = 0 requires
that Ey = –vxBz, and Ey is known as the Hall ﬁeld. For electron concentration n, the current density is jx = nevx;
thus,  Ey =  –jxBz/en  ≡  –jxBzRH,  where  RH =  –1/en,  the  Hall  coefﬁcient.  Thus,  simple  measurements  of  the
quantities Ey, jx, and Bz yield a very important quantity: n.
