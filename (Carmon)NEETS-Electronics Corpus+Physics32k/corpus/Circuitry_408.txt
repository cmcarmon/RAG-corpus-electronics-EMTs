Operational amplifier characteristics 
 
Having now defined the parameters that we use to 
describe  operational  amplifiers  we  shall  now 
consider the desirable characteristics for an ‘ideal’ 
operational amplifier. These are: 
(a) The open-loop voltage gain should be very high 
(ideally infinite).  
(b)  The  input  resistance  should  be  very  high 
(ideally infinite).  
(c)  The  output  resistance  should  be  very  low 
(ideally zero).  
(d)  Full-power  bandwidth  should  be  as  wide  as 
possible.  
(e) Slew rate should be as large as possible.  
(f) Input offset should be as small as possible.
