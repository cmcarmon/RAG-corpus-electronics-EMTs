interpolation process requires that an integral number of points, 
L
-1, be interpolated between existing points,
such  as  interpolation  of  5  new  points  between  existing  pairs  of  points.  The  decimation  process  increases  a
L
. MATLAB
sampling interval by 
contains functions for decimation and interpolation, as well as a function for a resampling of a signal using a
non-integer factor of
