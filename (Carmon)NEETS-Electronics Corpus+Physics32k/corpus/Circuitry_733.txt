Procedure 
 
Connect the circuit and measure the voltages at the 
following  test  points  with  no  fault  present;  TR1 
collector,  base  and  emitter;  IC1  inverting  input 
(pin-2)  and  non-inverting  input  (pin-3).  Record 
your results in a suitable table. 
  Repeat 
following fault conditions present: 
 
 
 
 
In each case, use your knowledge of how the circuit 
operates to justify the readings obtained.
