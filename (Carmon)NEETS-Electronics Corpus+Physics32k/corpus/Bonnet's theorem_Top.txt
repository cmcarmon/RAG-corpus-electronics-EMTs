In classical mechanics, Bonnet's theorem states that if n different force fields each produce the same geometric orbit (say, an ellipse of given dimensions) albeit with different speeds v1, v2,...,vn at a given point P, then the same orbit will be followed if the speed at point P equals

This theorem was first derived by Adrien-Marie Legendre in 1817, but it is named after Pierre Ossian Bonnet.
