The resistance of a piece of material depends on its geometry. As illus-
trated in Figure 1.14, assume the resistor has a conducting channel with
cross-sectional area a,
length l, and resistivity œÅ. This channel is terminated
at its extremes by two conducting plates that extend to form the two terminals
of the resistor. If this cylindrical piece of material satisfies the lumped matter
