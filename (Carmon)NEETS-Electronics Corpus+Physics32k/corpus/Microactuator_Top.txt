A microactuator is a microscopic servomechanism that supplies and transmits a measured amount of energy for the operation of another mechanism or system. As a general actuator, following standards have to be met.
Large travel
High precision
Fast switching
Low power consumption
Power free force sustainability
For microactuator, there are two in addition
Microstructurability
Integrability
