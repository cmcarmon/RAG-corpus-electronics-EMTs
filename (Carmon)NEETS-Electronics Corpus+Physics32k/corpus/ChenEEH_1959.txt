. The sum TC heuristic is the most time-efﬁcient for both
the worst- and average-case simulations with average
reconﬁguration times over all circuits of about 43 sec
and 18 sec, respectively. These times are quite promising.
. The suitability of heuristic TCs for time-efﬁciency was
demonstrated by an experiment in which we randomly
chose transitions only for the O-net (root of the T-DAG);
the transitions for the other nodes were chosen based on
the sum TC3. On the average, the partial-random case
shows an increase in reconﬁguration time over that of
the full sum TC case by 65% for the worst-case fault-
pattern and by 126% for the average-case pattern. The
track overheads remain the same as that of the sum
TC used.
