Status of Silicon Detector Technology
The simply structured silicon detectors fabricated with parallel contacts on a silicon wafer continue to serve a
well established need for charged particle spectroscopy. Where economies of scale can be applied, ion implanted
detectors  have  replaced  surface  barrier  detectors.  In  projects  of  sufÔ¨Åcient  size  to  support  their  development,
specialized low-noise silicon drift detectors and CCD-based detectors have been designed and fabricated with
promising room-temperature energy resolution: 200 eV FWHM at 5.9 KeV. These highly structured detector
