The slew rate occurs because at some stage in the ampliﬁer a frequency-compensating
capacitor will have to be charged, and the available limited charging current restricts the maximum
rate of change of the capacitor voltage. With externally compensated op amps, such as the 709,
slew rates will depend on the value of the compensating capacitors, which are in turn chosen
on the basis of the closed-loop gain needed. The lower the gain, the higher the compensating
capacitors, and hence the lower the slew rate. For a µA 709, the slew rate is 0.3 V/µs at A = 1
and 1.5 V/µs at A = 10.
