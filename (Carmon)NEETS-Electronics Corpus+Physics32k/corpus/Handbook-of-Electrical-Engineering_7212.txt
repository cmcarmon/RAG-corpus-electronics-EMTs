Run lengths from 0 to 63 are encoded by terminating codes, and run lengths in equal multiples of 64 from
64 to 1728 are encoded by makeup codes. Thus any run length up to 1728 can be described by a makeup code
plus an appropriate terminating code. Additional makeup codewords are available for equipment that accom-
modates wider paper while maintaining the same resolution. Tables of modiÔ¨Åed Huffman run-length termi-
nating and makeup codes are given in [Jayant and Noll, 1984].
