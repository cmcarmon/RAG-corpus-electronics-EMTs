small amount of power being reflected back to the transmitting device. When using a termination as a
load, you should ensure that its wattage rating exceeds the power output of the equipment to which it is
connected. You can also measure this type of termination by using a standard ohmmeter to read the
resistance between the center conductor and the shield of the rf connector.
