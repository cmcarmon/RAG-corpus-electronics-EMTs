(Solution on p. 139.)
In high-end audio, deviation of a sine wave from the ideal is measured by the total harmonic
distortion, which equals the total power in the harmonics higher than the ﬁrst compared to the
signal’s total power. Find an expression for the total harmonic distortion for any periodic signal.
Is this calculation most easily performed in the time or frequency domain?
