When you use your multimeter to test and analyze circuits, you must con-
sider what settings to dial up, whether you’re testing components individu-
ally or as part of a circuit, whether the circuit should be powered up or not, 
and where you place the test leads (in series or in parallel with whatever 
you’re testing).
