Spectral Analysis and Signal Bandwidth
Spectral analysis is based on the fact that a sinusoidal waveform is completely characterized by
three quantities: amplitude, phase, and frequency. By plotting amplitude and phase as a function
of frequency f (= ω/2π = 1/T ), the frequency-domain picture conveys all the information,
including the signal’s bandwidth and other signiﬁcant properties about the signal that consists
entirely of sinusoids. The two plots together (amplitude versus frequency and phase versus
frequency) constitute the line spectrum of the signal x(t).
