AC	and	DC	systems	(or	alternating	current	and	direct	current	systems)	are	often
associated	to	each	other.	When	the	AC	system	is	mentioned,	so	is	the	DC	system.
Conversely,	when	it’s	the	DC	system’s	turn	to	be	in	the	spotlight,	it	won’t	be	long
until	the	AC	system	is	mentioned.	This	is	because	these	systems	are	opposite	of
one	another;	to	get	a	better	understanding	of	one	of	them,	it’s	recommended	to	be
familiar	with	the	other,	as	well.
Moreover,	AC	and	DC	systems	are	types	of	a	circuit’s	current	flow.	In	an	AC
system,	the	current	flow	changes	its	direction	occasionally.	Meanwhile,	in	a	DC
system,	the	current	flow	follows	a	single	direction.
It	can	be	deduced,	therefore,	that	an	AC	system	grants	a	circuit	freedom	to	let	the
current	flow	in	several	directions.	While	this	can	be	an	advantage,	this	doesn’t
permit	the	continuous	flow	that	a	DC	system	can	entitle.
So,	should	you	use	an	AC	system	or	a	DC	system?	The	decision	as	to	which	current
system	is	dependent	on	the	more	practical	design	to	follow;	take	into	account	the
aim	of	having	your	own	circuit.	If	you	prefer	something	grand	and	you	intend	to
power	something	large,	the	AC	system	can	step	in.	On	the	other	hand,	if	you’re
good	with	a	basic	setup,	you	can	use	the	DC	system’s	concept	as	basis.
