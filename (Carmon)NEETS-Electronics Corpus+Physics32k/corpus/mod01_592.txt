This formula is used to solve for the equivalent resistance of a number of unequal parallel resistors.
You must find the lowest common denominator in solving these problems. If you are a little hazy on
finding the lowest common denominator, brush up on it in Mathematics Volume 1, NAVEDTRA 10069
(Series).
