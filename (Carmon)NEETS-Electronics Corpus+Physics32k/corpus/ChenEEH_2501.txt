Planar structures include strip line, microstrip, slot line,
coplanar waveguide (CPW), and coplanar strip line (CPS) as
well as other variants. Nonplanar structures usually refer to
classical metallic waveguides, coaxial (coax) lines, and dielec-
tric waveguides. Hybrid or quasiplanar structures are a com-
bination of planar and nonplanar (waveguides) platforms such
as slot lines suspended in the E-plane of a waveguide (ﬁnline)
or strip lines suspended in the H-plane of a wave guide. From
the manufacturing point of view, planar and hybrid structures
offer easy integration of passive and active components. This is
an advantage over classical waveguide or coax circuits for
which integration of active and passive circuit parts is much
more difﬁcult and usually leads to much larger circuit layouts.
Figure 7.2 shows a cross-sectional view of commonly used
transmission lines that have already been discussed in Gupta
et al. (1996) and Itoh (1987) with respect to their electrical and
mechanical properties.
