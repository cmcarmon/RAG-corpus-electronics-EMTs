NEMP can burn out electrical and electronic equipment
on the earth’s surface located many hundreds of miles away
from the detonation of a nuclear bomb above the earth’s
atmosphere. Equipment failures on this geographical scale
could leave a nation largely defenseless against subsequent
attack. HPM neutralize electronics in the same manner as
NEMP but can be applied on a more selective basis for either
tactical or strategic applications. For both NEMP and HPM,
computational solutions of Maxwell’s equations have been
used to understand the complex electromagnetic wave pene-
tration and coupling mechanisms
targets
and create means to mitigate these mechanisms. FDTD
is particularly useful for these purposes since it can model
extremely complicated three-dimensional
in a
straightforward manner. Figure 9.16 illustrates the results of
