23b MIN RF ATTEN DB This selects the lowest value of attenuation allowed: Actual RF attenuation is set
by the microcomputer according to the logarithm selected by the MIN NOISE/MIN
DISTORTION (No. 27) button. If RF attenuation is increased by changing MIN
RF ATTEN, the microcomputer automatically changes IF gain to maintain the
current reference level.
