First, note that XL and XC are no longer equal. XC is larger than it was at resonance; XL is smaller. By 
applying the formulas you have learned, you know that a lower frequency produces a higher capacitive 
reactance and a lower inductive reactance. The reactances subtract but do not cancel (X L − XC = 1260 − 
5300 = 4040 ohms (capacitive)). At an input frequency of 100 kHz, the circuit (still resonant to 205 kHz) 
has a net reactance of 4040 ohms. In our theoretically perfect circuit, the total opposition (Z) is equal to 
X, or 4040 ohms.
