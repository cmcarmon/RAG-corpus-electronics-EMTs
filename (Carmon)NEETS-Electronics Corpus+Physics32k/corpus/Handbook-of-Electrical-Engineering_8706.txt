To illustrate the paradigm shifts brought on by HLLs over the past 30 years, consider PROLOG, LISP, SQL,
C++,  and  various  operating  system  command  languages.  PROLOG  is  based  on  ﬁrst-order  logic.  Instead  of
computing a numerical answer, PROLOG programs derive a conclusion. LISP is based on symbolic processing
instead  of  numerical  processing  and  is  often  used  to  symbolically  solve  problems  in  calculus,  robotics,  and
artiﬁcial  reasoning.  SQL  is  a  database  language  for  manipulating  large  quantities  of  data  without  regard  for
whether it is numeric or symbolic. C++ is based on the object-oriented paradigm, a model of the world that
is particularly powerful for engineering, scientiﬁc, and business problem solving.
