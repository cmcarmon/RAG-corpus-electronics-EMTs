The  concept  of  duality  is  a  time-saving,  effort-effective  measure  of
solving circuit problems. Consider the similarity between Eq. (8.4) and
Eq. (8.29). The two equations are the same, except that we must inter-
change the following quantities: (1) voltage and current, (2) resistance
and  conductance,  (3)  capacitance  and  inductance.  Thus,  it  sometimes
occurs in circuit analysis that two different circuits have the same equa-
tions and solutions, except that the roles of certain complementary ele-
ments  are  interchanged.  This  interchangeability  is  known  as  the
principle of duality.
