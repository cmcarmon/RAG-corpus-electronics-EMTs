1. Blocking/unblocking: The blocking solution tends to
provide higher dependability than security. Failure to
establish a blocking signal from a remote end can result
in overtripping for external faults. The unblocking
solution offers a good compromise of both high de-
pendability (channel not required to trip) and high
security (blocking is continuous).
