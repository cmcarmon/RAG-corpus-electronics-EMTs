Our discussion thus far treated a MOSFET as a three-terminal device.
Notice, however, that the MOSFET is controlled by the voltage across a pair of
terminals, namely, G and S. Similarly, we were interested in the voltage across,
and current through, the D and S terminal pair. As discussed in Section 1.5,
this natural pairing of terminals suggests an alternate MOSFET representation
using ports. As shown in Figure 6.12, we can treat the G and S terminal pair as
the input port or the control port and the D and S terminal pair as the output
port of the MOSFET.
