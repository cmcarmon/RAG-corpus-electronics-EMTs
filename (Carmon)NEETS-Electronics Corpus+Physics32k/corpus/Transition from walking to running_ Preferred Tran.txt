The preferred transition speed is the speed at which an organism typically changes from one gait to another. Humans spontaneously switch from a walk to a run as speed increases. In humans, the preferred transition speed from walking to running typically occurs around 2.0 m/s (4.5 mph), although slight differences have been shown based on testing methodology.
