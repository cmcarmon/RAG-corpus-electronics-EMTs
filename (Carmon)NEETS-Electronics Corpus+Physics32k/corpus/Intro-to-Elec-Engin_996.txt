and (a2,−a2), connected in series by their end connections. The span of each coil is one-half
wavelength of ﬂux, or 180 electrical degrees for the full-pitch coil. Since the generated voltage
now goes through two complete cycles per revolution of the rotor, the frequency is then twice the
speed in revolutions per second, consistent with Equation (12.2.8).
