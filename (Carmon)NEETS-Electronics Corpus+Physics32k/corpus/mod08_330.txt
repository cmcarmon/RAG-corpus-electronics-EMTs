Output number one is a signal that is in phase with input number two, and output number two is a
signal that is in phase with input number one. The amplitude of each output signal is the input signal
multiplied by the gain of the amplifier. With 180-degree-out-of-phase input signals, each output signal is
greater in amplitude than either input signal by a factor of the gain of the amplifier.
