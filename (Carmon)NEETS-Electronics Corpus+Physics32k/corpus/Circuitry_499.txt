Procedure 
 
Connect  the  circuit  shown  in  Fig.  10.33  (see  also 
Fig.  10.34  for 
the  corresponding  breadboard 
layout).    Note  that  the  green  LED  should  become 
illuminated  when  the  bistable  is  in  the  SET 
condition  (i.e.  when  Q  is  at  logic  1)  and  the  red 
LED should become illuminated when the bistable 
is in the RESET condition. Note also that the 47 k(cid:2)
resistors act as pull-up  resistors. They are used to 
ensure  that  the  respective  input  goes  to  logic  1 
when the  corresponding link is removed.
