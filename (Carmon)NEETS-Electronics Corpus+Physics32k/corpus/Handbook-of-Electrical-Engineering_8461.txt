The value ri is an integer designated as the radix, and in a nonredundant number system it is an integer equal
to the number of allowed values for  xi . In general  xi could consist of more than one bit. The numerical value
associated with x is designated as the explicit value of xe . In conventional number systems the radix ri is the
same positive integer for all the digit positions xi and with the canonical set of digit values
