Suppose we wished to measure the resistance of some component located a signiÔ¨Åcant dis-
tance away from our ohmmeter. Such a scenario would be problematic, because an ohmmeter
measures all resistance in the circuit loop, which includes the resistance of the wires (Rwire)
connecting the ohmmeter to the component being measured (Rsubject):
