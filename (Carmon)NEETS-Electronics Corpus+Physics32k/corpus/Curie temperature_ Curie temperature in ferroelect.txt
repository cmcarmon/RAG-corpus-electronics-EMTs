In analogy to ferromagnetic and paramagnetic materials, the term Curie temperature is also applied to the temperature at which a ferroelectric material transitions to being paraelectric.
T0 is the temperature where ferroelectric materials lose their spontaneous polarisation as a first or second order phase change occurs, that is the internal structure changes or the internal symmetry changes. In certain cases T0 is equal to the Curie temperature however the Curie temperature can be 10 kelvins lower than T0.
