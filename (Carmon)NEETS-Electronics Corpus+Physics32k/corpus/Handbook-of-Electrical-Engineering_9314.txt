High-level languages support these three constructors by
(1) juxtaposition for sequencing, (2) if-then-else and case
(switch) constructs for selection, and (3) while-do and for
loops for iteration. The somewhat rigid restriction on loops
sometimes requires the duplication of code. Some languages
ease this problem by providing a  break or leave statement
that permits leaving a loop prematurely (Fig. 90.13). A typ-
ical example for a program that proÔ¨Åts from this mechanism
is a loop that reads and processes records and terminates
when  a  record  with  some  given  property  is  found.  In
Fig. 90.13  block  B  reads  and  block  A  processes  a  record.
With a strict while-loop the code of B must be duplicated.
