Just from geometrical considerations alone, nonceramic in-
sulators should offer superior performance under contami-
nated conditions when compared to their porcelain and glass
counterparts due to their smaller diameter. Additional im-
provement in contamination performance can be obtained by
using materials that are hydrophobic, hence suppressing leak-
age current and discharge activity; they can remain in this state
for a long time in service. Silicone rubber is one type of
material that Ô¨Åts into this category. Within a particular ma-
terial family, the leakage current suppression capability is
dependent on the formulation, but in general, silicone poly-
mers have better leakage current suppression capability than
other outdoor insulating materials.
