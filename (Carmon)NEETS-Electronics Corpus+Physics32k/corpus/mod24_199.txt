Intermodal or modal dispersion causes the input light pulse to spread. The input light pulse is made
up of a group of modes. As the modes propagate along the fiber, light energy distributed among the
modes is delayed by different amounts. The pulse spreads because each mode propagates along the fiber
at different speeds. Since modes travel in different directions, some modes travel longer distances. Modal
dispersion occurs because each mode travels a different distance over the same time span, as shown in
figure 2-25. The modes of a light pulse that enter the fiber at one time exit the fiber a different times. This
condition causes the light pulse to spread. As the length of the fiber increases, modal dispersion increases.
