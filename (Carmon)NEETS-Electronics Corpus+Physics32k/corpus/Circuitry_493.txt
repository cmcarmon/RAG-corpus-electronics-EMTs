Logic levels are simply the range of voltages used 
to  represent  the  logic  states  0  and  1.  The  logic 
levels  for  CMOS  differ  markedly  from  those 
associated  with  TTL.  In  particular,  CMOS  logic 
levels are relative to the supply voltage used while 
the logic levels associated with TTL devices tend to 
be absolute (see Table 10.8).
