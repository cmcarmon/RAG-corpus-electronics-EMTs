Schematic view and experimental setups of the RIC wettability testing method is described in Figure 1. Core plugs are divided into 3â€“4 core samples, each of 3.8 cm average diameter and 1.5 cm length. The lateral area of each core sample is sealed by epoxy resin to ensure one-dimensional liquid penetration into the core by imbibition. A hook is mounted on top side of the core sample.
The RIC setup includes a beaker to host the imbibing fluid. A thin rope connects the core sample to a high-precision balance (0.001 gm accurate). A hanging core sample is positioned with the bottom part of the sample barely touching the imbibing fluid in the beaker. Relative saturation as well as mass of core samples starts to change during imbibition. A computer connected to a balance continuously monitors the core sample mass change over time. Plots of squared mass change versus time are generated.
