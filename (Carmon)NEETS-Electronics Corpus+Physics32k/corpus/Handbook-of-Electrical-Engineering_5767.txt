Voltage  stability: The  ability  of  the  combined  generation  and  transmission  system  to  supply  load  after  a
disturbance, increased load, or change in system conditions without an uncontrollable and progressive
decrease in voltage [Kundur, 1994]. Loss of voltage instability may stem from the attempt of load dynamics
to restore power consumption beyond the capability of the combined transmission and generation system.
Both small signal and transient voltage instability can occur.
