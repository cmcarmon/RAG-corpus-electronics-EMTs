In  the  star  topology  stations  are  homed  into  a  central  hub  which  can  manage  their  access  to  the  media.
Active hubs physically control media access, while passive hubs merely broadcast incoming packets to speciÔ¨Åc
output ports. Linear combiner/dividers based on lithium niobate technology allow incoming optical signals to
be combined and distributed to output ports according to electronically programmed combining and dividing
ratios. A common scheme is to use time-division multiplexing with the star topology. The hub can serve as the
central controller, allocating time slots to individual stations, or reservations can be used in the manner of a
satellite-based network.
