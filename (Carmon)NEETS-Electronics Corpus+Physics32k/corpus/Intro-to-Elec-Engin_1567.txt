15.2.34 The operating frequency range of a superhetero-
dyne FM receiver is 88–108 MHz. The IF and LO
frequencies are so chosen that fIF < fLO. If the
(cid:7)
image frequency f
c must fall outside of the 88–
108-MHz range, determine the minimum needed
f IF and the corresponding range of f LO.
15.2.35 The television audio signal of Figure 15.2.29 is
frequency modulated with f = 25 kHz and has
∼= 2(ω + 2Wf )
