Spherical Conﬁguration
The  spherical  (or  polar)  conﬁguration  consists  of  two  revolute  joints
and one linear joint (RRP), as shown in Fig. 101.5. This results in a set
of joint coordinates that matches with the spherical coordinate system.
A typical work envelope for a spherical robot is shown in Fig. 101.6.
