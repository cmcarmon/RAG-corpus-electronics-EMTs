Although the indwelling catheter tip pressure transducer appears to solve many of the problems associated
with  the  external  pressure  transducer,  there  are  still  important  problems  in  pressure  transducer  design  that
need to be addressed. Long-term stability of pressure transducers is not very good. This is especially problematic
for  venous  pressure  measurements  which  are  carried  out  at  relatively  low  pressure.  Long-term  changes  in
baseline pressure require pressure transducers to be frequently adjusted to be certain of zero pressure. While
this can be done relatively easily for external and indwelling pressure transducers, there is no way to carry out
this procedure for implanted transducers, since there is not a way to establish zero pressure at the sensor. Thus
devices that have very low long-term baseline drift are essential for implantable applications.
