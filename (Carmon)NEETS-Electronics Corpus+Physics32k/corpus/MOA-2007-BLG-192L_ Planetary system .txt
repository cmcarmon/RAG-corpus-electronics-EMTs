The discovery of a planet, MOA-2007-BLG-192Lb, orbiting this object was announced on June 2, 2008. This planet, with a mass of approximately 3.3 times that of Earth, is one of the smallest known extrasolar planets. It was found when it caused a gravitational microlensing event on the night of May 24, 2007, which was detected as part of the MOA-II gravitational microlensing survey at the Mount John University Observatory in New Zealand.
