When the dual-speed synchro system includes control transformers, there is always the possibility of 
a 180ยบ error being present in the system. The reason is the rotor of the CT is not energized and its error-
voltage output is zero both at its proper position and also at a point 180ยบ away from that position. To 
prevent the CT from locking 180ยบ out of phase with the rest of the system, a low voltage is applied across 
the rotor terminals of the coarse CT as shown in figure 1-36.
