The Alaska Time Zone observes standard time by subtracting nine hours from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC−09:00). During daylight saving time its time offset is eight hours (UTC−08:00). The clock time in this zone is based on mean solar time at the 135th meridian west of the Greenwich Observatory.
The zone includes nearly all of the U.S. state of Alaska and is one hour behind the Pacific Time Zone.
standard time: Alaska Standard Time (AKST)
daylight saving time: Alaska Daylight Time (AKDT)
The western Aleutian Islands observe Hawaii–Aleutian Time, one hour behind the remainder of the state.
Effective from 2007, the local time changes from AKST to AKDT at 02:00 LST to 03:00 LDT on the second Sunday in March and returns at 02:00 LDT to 01:00 LST on the first Sunday in November.
