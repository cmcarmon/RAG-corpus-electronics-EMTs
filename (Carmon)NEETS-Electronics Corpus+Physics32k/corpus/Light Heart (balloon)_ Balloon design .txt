The balloon consisted of a sealed and pressurized envelope suspended from a cluster of ten helium balloons. Each of these was a superpressure balloon (also known as a constant pressure or positive pressure balloon.) In theory, such a balloon can retain a constant altitude over very long-distance flights of several days' duration, since the volume of the envelope remains relatively constant over time. Changes in the pressure of the gas due to heating and cooling are accommodated by mitigating the temperature changes and using an inelastic envelope. The sealed and insulated gondola, which Gatch constructed at home, was designed to maintain the same partial pressure of Oxygen as at sea level (40% oxygen at 0.5 atmospheres).
