Hamiltonian systems can be classified as integrable and nonintegrable. SAM is integrable when the mass ratio

=
M

m
=

{\displaystyle \mu =M/m=3}
. The system also looks pretty regular for

{\displaystyle \mu =4n^{2}-1=3,15,35,...}
, but the



μ
=

{\displaystyle \mu =3}
case is the only integrable mass ratio found so far. For many other values of the mass ratio (and initial conditions) SAM displays chaotic motion.
Numerical studies indicate that when the orbit is singular (initial conditions:

θ

=

{\displaystyle r=0,{\dot {r}}=v,\theta =\theta _{0},{\dot {\theta }}=0}
), the pendulum executes a single symmetrical loop and returns to the origin, regardless of the value of




θ

{\displaystyle \theta _{0}}
. When




θ

{\displaystyle \theta _{0}}
is small (near vertical), the trajectory describes a "teardrop", when it is large, it describes a "heart". These trajectories can be exactly solved algebraically, which is unusual for a system with a non-linear Hamiltonian.
