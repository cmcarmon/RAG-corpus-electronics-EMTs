and  frequency  to  a  variable  dc  voltage.  The  power  devices  used  for  this  application  are  generally 
average value of the output voltage is controlled by varying the conduction time of the SCRs. The turn-on of
the  SCR  is  achieved  by  providing  a  gate  pulse  when  it  is  forward-biased.  The  turn-off  is  achieved  by  the
commutation 
of  current  from  one  device  to  another  at  the  instant  the  incoming  ac  voltage  has  a  higher
instantaneous  potential  than  that  of  the  outgoing  wave.  Thus  there  is  a  natural  tendency  for  current  to  be
commutated from the outgoing to the incoming SCR, without the aid of any external commutation circuitry.
This commutation process is often referred to as
