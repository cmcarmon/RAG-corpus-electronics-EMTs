where  P44  =  2(P11  2  P12).  Thus,  three  coefﬁcients P11,  P12,  and P44  are  required  to  completely  specify  the
piezoresistivity tensor for silicon and germanium single crystals, and only two, P11 and P12, for polycrystalline
ﬁlms. Under hydrostatic pressure conditions, the piezoresistivity coefﬁcient Ph for the preceding two symmetry
groups is a linear combination of the longitudinal P 11 and transverse P 12 components, Ph = P11 + 2P12. Unlike
the elastic stiffness cij (a fourth rank polar tensor), the piezoresistivity tensor Pmn is not symmetric, i.e., Pmn #
Pnm, except for the following point groups, C¥ v(¥ ¥ mmm), Oh(m3m), Td (43m), and O(432).
