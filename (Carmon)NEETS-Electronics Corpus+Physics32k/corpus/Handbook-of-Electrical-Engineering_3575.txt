Finally, electrical monitoring testing techniques, also called current/voltage testing, rely on the simple obser-
vation that an out-of-range current or voltage often indicates a defective or bad part. Possibly a short or open
is present causing a particular input/output signal to have the wrong voltage or current. Current testing, or Iddq
testing, is particularly useful for digital systems using CMOS integrated circuit technology. Normally, CMOS
circuits  have  very  low  static  or  quiescent  currents.  However,  physical  faults,  such  as  gate  oxide  defects,  can
increase static current by several orders of magnitude. Such a substantial change in static current is straight-
forward to detect. The principal advantages of current testing are that the tests are simple and the fault models
address detailed transistor-level defects. However, current testing requires that enough time be allotted between
input stimuli to allow the circuit to reach a static state, which slows testing down and causes problems with
circuits that cannot be tested at scaled clock rates.
