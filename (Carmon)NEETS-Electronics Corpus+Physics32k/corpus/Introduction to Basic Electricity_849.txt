Many graphical HTML editors such as Microsoft 
FrontPage® and Adobe Dreamweaver® use a layout 
engine similar to that in a DTP program and use a 
wySiwyG (What You See Is What You Get) editor. 
Serious web designers prefer to write in HTML code 
for their website because it offers greater control and 
because graphic editors result in extra codes that are 
not required to run the website.
