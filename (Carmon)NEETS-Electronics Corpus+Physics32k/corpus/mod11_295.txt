A spherical wavefront (one in which the energy spreads out in all directions) spreads out as it travels 
away from the antenna and produces a pattern that is not very directional. A wavefront that exists in only 
one plane does not spread because all of the wavefront moves forward in the same direction. For an 
antenna to be highly directive, it must change the normally spherical wavefront into a plane wavefront. 
Many highly directive microwave antennas produce a plane wavefront by using a reflector to focus the 
radiated energy. The PARABOLIC REFLECTOR is most often used for high directivity.
