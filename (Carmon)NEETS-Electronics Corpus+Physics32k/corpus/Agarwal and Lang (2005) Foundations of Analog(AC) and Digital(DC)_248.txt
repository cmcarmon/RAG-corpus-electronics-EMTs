Lumped circuit elements are the fundamental building blocks of electronic cir-
cuits. Virtually all of our analyses will be conducted on circuits containing
two-terminal elements; multi-terminal elements will be modeled using combi-
nations of two-terminal elements. We have already seen several two-terminal
elements such as resistors, voltage sources, and current sources. Electronic
access to an element is made through its terminals.
