In Euclidean plane geometry, the equichordal point problem is the question whether a closed planar convex body can have two equichordal points. The problem was originally posed in 1916 by Fujiwara and in 1917 by Wilhelm Blaschke, Hermann Rothe, and Roland Weitzenb√∂ck. A generalization of this problem statement was answered in the negative in 1997 by Marek R. Rychlik.
