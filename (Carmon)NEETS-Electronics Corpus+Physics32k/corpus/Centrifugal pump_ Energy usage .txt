The energy usage in a pumping installation is determined by the flow required, the height lifted and the length and friction characteristics of the pipeline. The power required to drive a pump (




P

i




{\displaystyle P_{i}}
), is defined simply using SI units by:





P

i


=








ρ

g

H

Q









η







{\displaystyle P_{i}={\cfrac {\rho \ g\ H\ Q}{\eta }}}

where:





P

i




{\displaystyle P_{i}}
is the input power required (W)




ρ


{\displaystyle \rho }
is the fluid density (kg/m3)




g


{\displaystyle g}
is the standard acceleration of gravity (9.80665 m/s2)




H


{\displaystyle H}
is the energy Head added to the flow (m)




Q


{\displaystyle Q}
is the flow rate (m3/s)




η


{\displaystyle \eta }
is the efficiency of the pump plant as a decimal
The head added by the pump (



H


{\displaystyle H}
) is a sum of the static lift, the head loss due to friction and any losses due to valves or pipe bends all expressed in metres of fluid. Power is more commonly expressed as kilowatts (103 W, kW) or horsepower (hp = kW/0.746). The value for the pump efficiency,

{\displaystyle \eta _{pump}}
, may be stated for the pump itself or as a combined efficiency of the pump and motor system.
The energy usage is determined by multiplying the power requirement by the length of time the pump is operating.
