To calculate the Norton resistance (RN orton), we do the exact same thing as we did for
calculating Thevenin resistance (RT hevenin): take the original circuit (with the load resistor
still removed), remove the power sources (in the same style as we did with the Superposition
Theorem: voltage sources replaced with wires and current sources replaced with breaks), and
Ô¨Ågure total resistance from one load connection point to the other:
