The  relation  between  signal  classiﬁcation  and  estimation  was  established  in  Kailath  [1969]  for  continuous
time signals contaminated by additive statistically independent Gaussian white noise. It was shown that min-
imum probability of error classiﬁcation can be achieved by applying the MAP decision rule to the causal MMSE
estimator of the clean signal. This interesting theoretical result provides the intuitive basis for a popular approach
for recognition of noisy speech signals. In this approach, the clean signal or some feature vector of the signal
is  ﬁrst  estimated  and  then  recognition  is  applied.  In  the  statistical  framework  of  hidden  Markov  modeling,
however, the direct recognition approach presented earlier is signiﬁcantly simpler since both the clean signal
and the noisy signal are HMMs [Ephraim, 1992]. Hence, the complexity of recognizing the estimated signal is
the same as that of recognizing the noisy signal directly.
