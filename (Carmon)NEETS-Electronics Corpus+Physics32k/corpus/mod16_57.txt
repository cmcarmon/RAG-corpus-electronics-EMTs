You can determine the calibration status of any test equipment by checking the calibration label or
tag located on the equipment. These calibration labels or tags advise you as to whether the item is usable
and within its calibration interval. Tags and labels to be used in the METROLOGY CALIBRATION
(METCAL) coordination program are listed in the following paragraphs. No other calibration labels or
tags are authorized to be placed on test equipment.
