DC voltage measurement 
 
Figure  14.16  shows  how  to  make  DC  voltage 
measurements  using  a  digital  multi-range  meter. 
The  red  and  black  test  leads  are  connected  to  the 
‘V-OHM’ and ‘COM’ sockets respectively. In Fig. 
14.6,  the  mode  switch  and  range  selector  is  set  to 
DCV, 200 V, and the display indicates a reading of 
124.5 V. 
 
DC current measurements 
 
Figure  14.17  shows  how  to  make  a  DC  current 
measurement. Here, the red and black test leads are 
connected 
the  ‘mA’  and  ‘COM’  sockets
