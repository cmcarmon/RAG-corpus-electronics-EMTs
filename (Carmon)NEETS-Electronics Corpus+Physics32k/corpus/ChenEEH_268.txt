To develop low-cost, high-efﬁciency, low-proﬁle, high-power
density, fast-transient-response, board-mount VRM modules
for future generation microprocessor loads, high operating
frequencies are desirable. Figure 1.35 shows the transient re-
sponse of the interleaved QSW VRM when it operates at
1 MHz. Obviously, the voltage spike is reduced signiﬁcantly.
