4. As you sweep through the frequencies, look at the VTVM. You’ll see the amplitude rise and fall
as you vary the output frequency of the signal generator. As you approach the lowest and the
highest frequencies that the magnetic tape recorder can effectively record, you’ll see the VTVM
drop to less than -  3 dB. This determines the lower and upper limits of the frequency-response
specification for that magnetic tape recorder.
