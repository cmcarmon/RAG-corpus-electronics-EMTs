L5 is the Sun–Earth Lagrangian point located close to the Earth's orbit 60° behind Earth.
Asteroid (419624) 2010 SO16, in a horseshoe companion orbit with Earth, is currently proximal to L5 but at a high inclination.
STEREO B (Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory – Behind) makes its closest pass to L5 in October 2009, on its orbit around the Sun, slightly slower than Earth.
The Spitzer Space Telescope is in an Earth-trailing heliocentric orbit drifting away c. 0.1 AU per year. In c. 2013–15 it has passed L5 in its orbit.
