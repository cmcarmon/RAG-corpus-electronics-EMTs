Consider  the  linear  circuit  in  Fig.  4.46(a).  It  is  assumed  that  the
circuit  contains  resistors  and  dependent  and  independent  sources.  We
have access to the circuit via terminals a and b, through which current
from an external source is applied. Our objective is to ensure that the
voltage-current relation at terminals a and b is identical to that of the
Thevenin  equivalent  in  Fig.  4.46(b).  For  the  sake  of  simplicity,  sup-
pose the linear circuit in Fig. 4.46(a) contains two independent voltage
sources 
and  We
may  obtain  any  circuit  variable,  such  as  the  terminal  voltage  v,  by
applying  superposition.  That  is,  we  consider  the  contribution  due  to
each  independent  source  including  the  external  source  i. By  superpo-
sition, the terminal voltage v is
