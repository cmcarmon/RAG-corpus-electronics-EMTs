In figure 2-19, note the relationship between the sky wave skip distance, the skip zone, and the 
ground wave coverage. The SKIP DISTANCE is the distance from the transmitter to the point where the 
sky wave is first returned to Earth. The size of the skip distance depends on the frequency of the wave, the 
angle of incidence, and the degree of ionization present.
