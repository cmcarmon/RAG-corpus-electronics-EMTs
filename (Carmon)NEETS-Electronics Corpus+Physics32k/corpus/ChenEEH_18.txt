Power (p) is the rate of doing work or the energy ﬂow rate.
When a charge of dq coulombs is moved from point A to point
B with a potential difference of v volts, the energy supplied
to the charge will be v dq joule [J]. If this movement takes
place in dt seconds, the power supplied to the charge will be
v dq/dt watts [W]. Because dq/dt is the charge ﬂow rate deﬁned
earlier as current i, the power supplied to the charge can be
written as:
