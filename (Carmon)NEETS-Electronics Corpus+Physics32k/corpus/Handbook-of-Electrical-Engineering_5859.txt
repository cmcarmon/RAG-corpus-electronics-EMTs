AC Generators
Today, most electric power is produced by synchronous generators. Synchronous generators rotate at a constant
.  This  speed  is  dictated  by  the  operating  frequency  of  the  system  and  the
speed,  called 
machine  structure.  There  are  also  ac  generators  that  do  not  necessarily  rotate  at  a  Ô¨Åxed  speed  such  as  those
