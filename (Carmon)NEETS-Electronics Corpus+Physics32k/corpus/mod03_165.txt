The amount of circuit resistance to be measured may vary over a wide range. In some cases it may
be only a few ohms, and in others it may be as great as 1,000,000 ohms (1 megohm). To enable the meter
to indicate any value being measured, with the least error, scale multiplication features are used in most
ohmmeters. For example, a typical meter will have four test lead jacks-COMMON, R ·  1, R ·  10, and
R · 100. The jack marked COMMON is connected internally through the battery to one side of the
moving coil of the ohmmeter. The jacks marked R ·  1, R ·  10, and R ·  100 are connected to three
different size resistors located within the ohmmeter. This is shown in figure 1-33.
