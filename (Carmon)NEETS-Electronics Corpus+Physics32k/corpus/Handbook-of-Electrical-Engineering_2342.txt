DC Equivalent Circuit Model of a FET. 
 In the dc equivalent circuit model of a FET, the gate is considered
isolated  because  the  gate-semiconductor  interface  is  formed  as  a  reverse-biased  diode  and  therefore  is  open
circuited. All capacitances are also assumed to represent open circuits. RGS, RGD, and RDS are neglected because
