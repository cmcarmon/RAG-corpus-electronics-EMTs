Intramodal, or chromatic, dispersion depends primarily on fiber materials. There are two types of
intramodal dispersion. The first type is material dispersion. The second type is waveguide dispersion.
Intramodal dispersion occurs because different colors of light travel through different materials and
different waveguide structures at different speeds.
