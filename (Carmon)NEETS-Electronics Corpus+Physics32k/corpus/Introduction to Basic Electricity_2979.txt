doping is the process of adding impurities to a 
semiconductor material. Two types of impurities are 
used. The first, called pentavalent, is made of  atoms 
with five valence electrons. Examples are  arsenic 
and antimony. The other, called trivalent, is made 
of  atoms with three valence electrons. Examples are 
 indium and gallium.
