window
operations
. A window operation performed on an image is nothing more than the process of examining the
pixels in a certain region of the image, called the window region, and computing some type of mathematical
function derived from the pixels in the window. In most cases the windows are square or rectangle, although
other shapes have been used. After the operation is performed, the result of the computation is placed in the
3 pixel window has been extracted from the image. The values of the
center pixel of the window where a 3 
, are used to compute a new pixel value which replaces the value of
a
pixels in the window, labeled

a
,  and  the  window  is  moved  to  a  new  center  location  until  all  the  pixels  in  the  original  image  have  been

processed. As an example of a window operation, suppose we computed the average value of the pixels in the
 and will tend to reduce noise in the image, but unfortunately
window. This operation is known as 
it will also tend to blur edge structures in the image.
