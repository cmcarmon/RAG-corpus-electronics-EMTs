where  the  window  function  w(n)  is  usually  zero  except  for  some  Ô¨Ånite  range,  and  the  variable  m  is  used  to
select the section of the sequence for analysis. The discrete Fourier transform (DFT) is obtained by uniformly
sampling  the  short-time  Fourier  transform  in  the  frequency  dimension.  Thus  an N-point  DFT  is  computed
using Eq. (15.14),
