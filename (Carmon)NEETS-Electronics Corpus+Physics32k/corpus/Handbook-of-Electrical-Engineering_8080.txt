Finally,  DSP  chips  typically  have  separate  arithmetic-logic  units  (ALU)  for  data  arithmetic  and  address
calculations. This serves two purposes: (1) data calculations can proceed unhindered by address calculations,
maintaining a high throughput, and (2) each unit can be specialized for its particular task. For example, the
data ALU may have additional circuitry to support saturation arithmetic, whereas the ALU used for address
calculations  may  provide  indexing,  auto-increment,  or  even  bit-reversal,  an  operation  required  for  the  fast
Fourier transform (FFT).
