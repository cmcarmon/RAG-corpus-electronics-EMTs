Tex is a unit of measure for the linear mass density of fibers, yarns and thread and is defined as the mass in grams per 1000 meters. The unit code is "tex". The most commonly used unit is actually the decitex (abbreviated dtex), which is the mass in grams per 10,000 meters. When measuring objects that consist of multiple fibers, the term "filament tex" is sometimes used, referring to the mass in grams per 1000 meters of a single filament.
Tex is used for measuring fiber size in many products, including cigarette filters, optical cable, yarn and fabric.
