9.4 S I M P L E C I R C U I T E X A M P L E S
To complete our introduction to capacitors and inductors, let us now examine
their behavior in the simple circuits shown in Figures 9.31 through 9.34. These
circuits are the same as those shown in Figures 2.25 and 2.26, except for the
replacement of the resistor in the latter figures by the capacitor or inductor in the
former figures. Because the two sets of circuits are so similar, we could analyze
the circuits shown in Figures 9.31 through 9.34 using the same approach applied
in Chapter 2 to the circuits shown in Figures 2.25 and 2.26. Alternatively, we
could carry out a node analysis as developed in Section 3.3. However, since the
circuits here are simple, we will follow the more intuitive approach outlined at
the end of Section 2.4, and save the formalities for the analysis of more complex
circuits in future chapters.
