An astronomical example is Pluto's largest moon Charon. Much more commonly, synchronous orbits are employed by artificial satellites used for communication, such as geostationary satellites.
For natural satellites, which can attain a synchronous orbit only by tidally locking their parent body, it always goes in hand with synchronous rotation of the satellite. This is because the smaller body becomes tidally locked faster, and by the time a synchronous orbit is achieved, it has had a locked synchronous rotation for a long time already.
