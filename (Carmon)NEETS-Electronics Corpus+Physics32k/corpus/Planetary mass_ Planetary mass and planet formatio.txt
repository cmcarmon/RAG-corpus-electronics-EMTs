The mass of a planet has consequences for its structure by having a large mass, especially while it is in the hand of process of formation. A body which is more than about one ten-thousandth of the mass of the Earth can overcome its compressive strength and achieve hydrostatic equilibrium: it will be roughly spherical, and since 2006 has been classified as a dwarf planet if it orbits around the Sun (that is, if it is not the satellite of another planet). Smaller bodies like asteroids are classified as "small Solar System bodies".
A dwarf planet, by definition, is not massive enough to have gravitationally cleared its neighbouring region of planetesimals: it is not known quite how large a planet must be before it can effectively clear its neighbourhood, but one tenth of the Earth's mass is certainly sufficient.
The smaller planets retain only silicates, and are terrestrial planets like Earth or Mars, though multiple-ME super-Earths have been discovered. The interior structure of rocky planets is mass-dependent: for example, plate tectonics may require a minimum mass to generate sufficient temperatures and pressures for it to occur.
If the protoplanet grows by accretion to more than about 5–10 M⊕, its gravity become large enough to retain hydrogen in its atmosphere. In this case, it will grow into a gas giant. If the planet then begins migration, it may move well within its system's frost line, and become a hot Jupiter orbiting very close to its star, then gradually losing small amounts of mass as the star's radiation strips its atmosphere.
The theoretical minimum mass a star can have, and still undergo hydrogen fusion at the core, is estimated to be about 75 MJ, though fusion of deuterium can occur at masses as low as 13 Jupiters.
