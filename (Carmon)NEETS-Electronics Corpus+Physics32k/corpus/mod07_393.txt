During the negative alternation of input voltage (dotted polarity signs), the anode is driven negative 
and the diode cannot conduct. When conditions such as these exist, the diode is in cutoff and remains in 
cutoff for 180 degrees, during which time no current flows in the circuit. The circuit current therefore has 
the appearance of a series of positive pulses, as illustrated by the shaded areas on the waveform in view 
B. Notice that although the current is in the form of pulses, the current always flows in the same direction. 
Current that flows in pulses in the same direction is called PULSATING DC. The diode has thus 
RECTIFIED the ac input voltage.
