Introduction
Computer-aided simulation is a powerful aid during the design or analysis of electronic circuits and semicon-
ductor  devices.  The  Ô¨Årst  part  of  this  chapter  focuses  on  analog  circuit  simulation.  The  second  part  covers
simulations of semiconductor processing and devices. While the main emphasis is on analog circuits, the same
simulation techniques may, of course, be applied to digital circuits (which are, after all, composed of analog
circuits). The main limitation will be the size of these circuits because the techniques presented here provide
a  very  detailed  analysis  of  the  circuit  in  question  and,  therefore,  would  be  too  costly  in  terms  of  computer
resources to analyze a large digital system.
