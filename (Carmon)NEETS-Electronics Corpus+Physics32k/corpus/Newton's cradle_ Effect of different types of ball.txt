Using different types of material will not change the action as long as the material is efficiently elastic. The size of the spheres will not change the results unless the increased weight exceeds the elastic limit of the material. If the solid balls are too large, energy will be lost as heat because the elastic limit increases as radius1.5 but the energy needed to be absorbed and released increases as radius3. Making the contact surfaces flatter can overcome this to an extent by distributing the compression to a larger amount of material but it can introduce an alignment problem. Steel is better than most materials because it allows the simple solution to apply more often in collisions after the first strike, its elastic range for storing energy remains good despite the higher energy caused by its weight, and the higher weight decreases the effect of air resistance.
