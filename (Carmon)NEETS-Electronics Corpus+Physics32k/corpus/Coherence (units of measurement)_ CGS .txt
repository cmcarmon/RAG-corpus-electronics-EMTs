The following is a list of coherent centimetre–gram–second (CGS) system of units:
acceleration (gals) = distance (centimetres) ÷ time2 (s2)
force (dynes) = mass (grams) × acceleration (m/s2)
energy (ergs) = force (dynes) × distance (centimetres)
pressure (barye) = force (dynes) ÷ area (cm2)
dynamic viscosity (poise) = mass (grams) ÷ (distance (centimetres) × time (seconds))
kinematic viscosity (stokes) = area (cm2) ÷ time (seconds)
