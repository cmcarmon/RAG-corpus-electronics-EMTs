LEDs for Fiber Optic Communications
GaAs  and  InGaAsP  LEDs  are  commonly  used  as  sources  for  ﬁber  optic  communications.  Since  they  are  an
incoherent  source,  it  is  only  practical  to  use  them  with  multimode  ﬁber.  Only  multimode  ﬁber  has  a  large
enough  core  diameter  and  numerical  aperture  (NA)  to  couple  in  enough  light  to  be  able  to  propagate  any
useful distance. Applications for LEDs in ﬁber optics are for short distance links using glass or plastic ﬁber at
relatively low bandwidths, typically in the Mb/s rather than Gb/s. Primary applications of these are for low cost
datalinks.
