Particle decay is a Poisson process, and hence the probability that a particle survives for time t before decaying is given by an exponential distribution whose time constant depends on the particle's velocity:

)





{\displaystyle P(t)=e^{-t/(\gamma \tau )}\,}


where




τ


{\displaystyle \tau }
is the mean lifetime of the particle (when at rest), and

{\displaystyle \gamma ={\frac {1}{\sqrt {1-v^{2}/c^{2}}}}}
is the Lorentz factor of the particle.
