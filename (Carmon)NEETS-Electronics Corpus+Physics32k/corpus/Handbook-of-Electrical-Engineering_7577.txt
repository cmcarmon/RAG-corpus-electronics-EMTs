2. Unused gates and inputs. If a gate on a package is not used, its inputs should be tied either high or low,
whichever results in the least supply current. For example, the 7400 draws three times the current with
the output low as with the output high, so the inputs of an unused 7400 gate should be grounded. An
unused input of a gate, however, must be connected so as not to affect the function of the active inputs.
For a 7400 NAND gate, such an input must either be tied high or paralleled with a used input. It must
be  recognized  that  paralleled  inputs  count  as  two  when  determining  the  fan-out.  Inputs  that  are  tied
high  can  be  connected  either  to VCC  through  a  1-kW  or  more  resistance  (for  protection  from  supply
voltage surges) or to the output of an unused gate whose input will establish a permanent output high.
Several  inputs  can  share  a  common  protective  resistance.  Unused  inputs  of  low-power  Schottky  TTL
can be tied directly to VCC, since 74LSxx inputs tolerate up to 15 V without breakdown. If inputs of low-
power Schottky are connected in parallel and driven as a single input, the switching speed is decreased,
in contrast to the situation with other TTL families.
