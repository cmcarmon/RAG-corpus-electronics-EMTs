Table 54.2 lists the pyroelectric properties of several different materials, single crystals, ceramics, and poly-
mers.  It  can  be  seen  that  triglycine  sulphate  (TGS)  and  its  deuterated  isomorph  (DTGS)  exhibit  the  highest
value  of  Fv  and  are  frequently  used  for  high-performance  single-element  detectors.  These  are  the  preferred
materials for pyroelectric vidicon targets. However, they are water soluble, difﬁcult to handle, and show poor
long-term  stability,  both  chemically  and  electrically,  because  of  their  low  Curie temperatures. Furthermore,
their dielectric loss is rather high, so that the FD ﬁgures are not so favorable. Lithium tantalate, on the other
hand, is an oxide single-crystal material which possesses a relatively low value of Fv but a very low loss so that
FD  is  favorable.  The  material  is  very  stable  and  is  now  widely  used  for  single-element  detectors.  Its  thermal
conductivity is quite high so that it is not a good material for the pyroelectric vidicon. The ferroelectric polymers
possess relatively low pyroelectric coefﬁcients and low dielectric constants with high losses, so that their ﬁgures
of merit are also quite low. Their low thermal conductivities make them quite favorable for use in the pyroelectric
vidicon and the fact that they are commercially available in thin sections (down to 6 mm) at low cost, removing
any requirement for expensive lapping and polishing, makes them attractive for some low-cost detectors. Their
low permittivities make them particularly well suited to large-area detectors.
