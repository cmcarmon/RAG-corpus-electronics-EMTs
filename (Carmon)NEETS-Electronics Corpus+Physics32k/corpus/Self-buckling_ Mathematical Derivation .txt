Suppose a uniform column fixed in a vertical direction at its lowest point, and carried to a height



l


{\displaystyle l}
, in which the vertical position becomes unstable and flexure begins. There is a body force



q


{\displaystyle q}
per unit length



q
=
ρ
g
A


{\displaystyle q=\rho gA}
, where



A


{\displaystyle A}
is the cross-sectional area of the column,



g


{\displaystyle g}
is the acceleration due to gravity and



ρ


{\displaystyle \rho }
is its mass density.
The column is slightly curved under its own weight, so the curve



w
(
x
)


{\displaystyle w(x)}
describes the deflection of the beam in the



y


{\displaystyle y}
direction at some position



x


{\displaystyle x}
.

Looking at any point on the column, we can write the moment equilibrium:




M
=
−

∫

0


x


q
(
y
−
w
)
d
x


{\displaystyle M=-\int _{0}^{x}q(y-w)dx}

where the right-hand side of the equation is the moment of the weight of BP about P.
According to Euler–Bernoulli beam theory:



M
=

{\displaystyle M=-EI{d^{2}w \over dx^{2}}}

Where



E


{\displaystyle E}
is the Young's modulus of elasticity of the substance,



I


{\displaystyle I}
is the moment of inertia.
Therefore, the differential equation of the central line of BP is:




E

{\displaystyle EI{d^{2}w \over dx^{2}}=q\int _{0}^{x}(y-w)dx}

Differentiating with respect to x, we get

We get that the governing equation is the third order linear differential equation with a variable coefficient. The way to solve the problem is to use new variables

{\displaystyle n,z,k}
and

{\displaystyle r}
