Sound intensity, denoted I, is defined by





I

=
p

v



{\displaystyle \mathbf {I} =p\mathbf {v} }

where
p is the sound pressure;
v is the particle velocity.
Both I and v are vectors, which means that both have a direction as well as a magnitude. The direction of sound intensity is the average direction in which energy is flowing.
The average sound intensity during time T is given by
