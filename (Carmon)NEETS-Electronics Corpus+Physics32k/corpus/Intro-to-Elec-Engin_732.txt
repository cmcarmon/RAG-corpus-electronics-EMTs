Common-Base (CB) Conﬁguration
The common-base (CB) ampliﬁer is shown in Figure 8.3.3(a), in which the base forms the common
terminal between the input and output circuits, and resistors R1, R2, RC, and RE are selected through
biasing. Capacitors CB, CC, and CE are chosen large enough to act as short circuits at the lowest
frequency of interest in the input signal vS. The output voltage vL is taken from the collector across
resistor RL. The small-signal ac equivalent circuit of the ampliﬁer is shown in Figure 8.3.3(b),
whose analysis yields the following results:
RH = RC(cid:8)RL = RC RL
RC + RL
rπ (ro + RH )
Ri =
Rin = RE(cid:8)Ri = RERi
RE + Ri
