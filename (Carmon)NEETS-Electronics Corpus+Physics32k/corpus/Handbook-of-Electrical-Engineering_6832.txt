Detection of Parametrized Signals
The correlation detector cannot usually be used directly unless the signal is known exactly. If, alternatively, the
u
signal is known up to a short vector 
 of random parameters (such as frequencies or phases) that are independent
of the noise, then an optimum test can be implemented by threshold comparison of the quantity
