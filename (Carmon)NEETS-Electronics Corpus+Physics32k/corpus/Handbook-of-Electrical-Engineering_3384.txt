One  promising  application  of  integrated  optic  devices  in  instrumentation  is  a  high-speed,  polarization-
independent optical switch for use in optical-time-domain reﬂectometers (OTDR). OTDRs are used to locate
breaks  or  poor  splices  in  ﬁber  optic  networks.  The  instruments  work  by  sending  out  an  optical  pulse  and
measuring the backscattered radiation returning to the instrument as a function of time. The next generation
of OTDRs will possibly employ an optical switch, which will be used to rapidly switch the optical ﬁber under
test from the pulsed light source to the OTDR receiver. Such an instrument could detect faults closer to the
OTDR than currently possible, which is important in the short-haul systems now being installed. This feature
is necessary for local area network (LAN) installations.
