AB ¼ B regardless of choice of B. In such case, A is said to
be the identity matrix and is most often represented by the
symbol I. The identity matrix is an example of a diagonal
matrix, where all aij ¼ 0 when i 6¼ j, written as A ¼
diag {1, 1, . . . , 1}. In MATLAB, I nn is generated with the
command eye (n). Taken all together, the set of square matrices
over F, matrix addition, matrix multiplication, and the zero
and identity matrices satisfy the six properties of a ring. A
discussion of a multiplicative inverse in the context of matrices
is left for Section 1.4.
