Energy to Start an Engine
A simpliÔ¨Åed circuit model for an automotive starter circuit is shown in Figure 2.8.3. Let the car
battery voltage be 12.5 V and let the automobile starter motor draw 60 A when turning over the
engine. If the engine starts after 10 seconds, we can easily calculate the power to the starter motor,
which is the same as the power out of the battery,
