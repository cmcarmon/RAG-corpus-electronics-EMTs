The composite diagram in figure 3-29 shows all resultant curves on a full-wavelength section of line
over a complete cycle. Notice that the amplitude of the voltage varies between zero and maximum in both
directions at the center and at both ends as well but, one-fourth of the distance from each end the voltage
is always zero. The resultant waveshape is referred to as a standing wave of voltage. Standing waves,
then, are caused by reflections, which occur only when the line is not terminated in its characteristic
impedance.
