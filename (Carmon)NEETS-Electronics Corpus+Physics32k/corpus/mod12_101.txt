Amplitude modulation refers to any method of varying the amplitude of an electromagnetic carrier 
frequency in accordance with the intelligence to be transmitted by the carrier. The CARRIER frequency is 
a radio-frequency wave suitable for modulation by the intelligence to be transmitted. One form of this 
method of modulation is simply to interrupt the carrier in accordance with a prearranged code.
