The rover weighs just 22 lb (10 kg) and when fully deployed is 11 in. (280 mm) high, 25 in. (630 mm) long,
and 19 in. (480 mm) wide. It is equipped with three cameras and an alpha proton x-ray spectrometer which must
be in contact with rocks or soil to measure elemental composition. A sensor detects alpha particle scattering and
proton and x-ray emissions. Sojourner runs on a solar array, sufÔ¨Åcient to power the rover for several hours per
day, even in the worst dust storms.
