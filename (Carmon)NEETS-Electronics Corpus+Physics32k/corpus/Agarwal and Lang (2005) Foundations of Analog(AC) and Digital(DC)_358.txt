Turning now to the analysis of the circuit in Figure 2.53, we see that it involves the
determination of 26 branch variables, which seems like a painful task. Fortunately, this
analysis can be greatly simplified by taking advantage of the symmetry of the circuit, and
that is the primary observation to be made here. As a consequence of the symmetry of
the circuit, the three branch currents i1, i2, and i3 are identical, as are the three branch
currents i4, i5, and i6. Further, KCL applied to the two nodes at the port terminals
shows that the sum of each group of three branch currents is I, so all six branch currents
equal I/3.
