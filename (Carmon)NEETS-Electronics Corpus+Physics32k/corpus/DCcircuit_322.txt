A lock-out/tag-out procedure works like this: all individuals working on a secured circuit
have their own personal padlock or combination lock which they set on the control lever of
a disconnect device prior to working on the system. Additionally, they must ﬁll out and sign
a tag which they hang from their lock describing the nature and duration of the work they
intend to perform on the system. If there are multiple sources of energy to be ”locked out”
(multiple disconnects, both electrical and mechanical energy sources to be secured, etc.), the
worker must use as many of his or her locks as necessary to secure power from the system
before work begins. This way, the system is maintained in a Zero Energy State until every last
lock is removed from all the disconnect and shutoff devices, and that means every last worker
gives consent by removing their own personal locks. If the decision is made to re-energize the
system and one person’s lock(s) still remain in place after everyone present removes theirs, the
tag(s) will show who that person is and what it is they’re doing.
