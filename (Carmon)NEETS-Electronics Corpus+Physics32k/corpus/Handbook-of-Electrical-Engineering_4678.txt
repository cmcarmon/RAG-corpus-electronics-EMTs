Any plane wave which is generated from a ﬁnite aperture will begin to diffract. This is exactly analogous to
light diffracting through a slit. Diffraction’s principal effect is to cause effective shifts in the ﬁlter’s tap weights
and phase which results in increased sidelobe levels in the measured frequency response. Diffraction is mini-
mized by proper choice of substrate and ﬁlter design.
