Figure 1.18 shows the case of undersampling for the signal
with Fourier transforms shown in Figure 1.16. Undersampling
means that the sampling rate is below the so-called Nyquist
rate of 2W, resulting in a frequency content above V > 2pW
that cannot be recovered by applying the low-pass reconstruc-
tion Ô¨Ålter. The content is folded back to lower frequencies, a
phenomenon called aliasing.
