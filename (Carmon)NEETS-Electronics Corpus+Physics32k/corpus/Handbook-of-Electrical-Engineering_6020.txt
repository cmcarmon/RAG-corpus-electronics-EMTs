Energy management is performed at control centers (see Fig. 67.1), typically called system control centers,
(EMS).  Data  acquisition  and  remote  control  is  per-
by  computer  systems  called 
  (SCADA)  systems.  These  latter
formed  by  computer  systems  called 
systems  may  be  installed  at  a  variety  of  sites  including  system  control  centers.  An  EMS  typically  includes  a
SCADA “front-end”  through  which  it  communicates  with  generating  plants,  substations,  and  other  remote
devices.
