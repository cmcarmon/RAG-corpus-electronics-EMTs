Notice in figure 1-10, in views A C, and E, that the rotor positions are achieved by shifting the total 
current through different stator windings (S1, S2, and S3). This causes the rotor to move toward the coil 
with the strongest magnetic field. To obtain the rotor positions in views B, D, and F, it was necessary only 
to reverse the battery connections. This causes the direction of current flow to reverse and in turn reverses 
the direction of the magnetic field. Since the rotor follows the magnetic field the rotor also changes 
direction. By looking closely at these last three rotor positions, you will notice that they are exactly 
opposite the first three positions we discussed. This is caused by the change in the direction of current 
flow. You can now see that by varying the voltages to the three stator coils, we can change the current in 
these coils and cause the rotor to assume any position we desire.
