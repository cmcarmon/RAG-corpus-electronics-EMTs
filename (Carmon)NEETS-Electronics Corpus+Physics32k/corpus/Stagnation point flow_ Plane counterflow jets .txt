Jets emerging from a slot-jets creates stagnation point in between according to potential theory. The flow near the stagnation point can by studied using self-similar solution. This setup is widely used in combustion experiments. The initial study of impinging stagnation flows are due to C.Y. Wang. Let two fluids with constant properties denoted with suffix

{\displaystyle 1({\text{top}}),\ 2({\text{bottom}})}
flowing from opposite direction impinge and let's assume the two fluids are immiscible and the interface(located at

) is planar. The velocity is given by
