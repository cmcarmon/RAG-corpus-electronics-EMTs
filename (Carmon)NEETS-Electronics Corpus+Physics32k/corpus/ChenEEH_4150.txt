We then presented methods and block diagrams for recovery
of clocks used for the carrier frequency and phase, the bit
timing, and the framing for various modulation methods.
While our block diagrams are based on hardware approaches,
they could just as easily be implemented in software in many
cases. We also explained that many manufacturers have pro-
prietary methods for determining clock recovery techniques.
Finally, we studied equalization techniques.
