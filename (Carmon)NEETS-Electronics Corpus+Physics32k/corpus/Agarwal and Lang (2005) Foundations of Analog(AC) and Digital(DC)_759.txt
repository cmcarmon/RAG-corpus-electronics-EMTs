These rules can be used to simplify logic expressions to reduce the number
of gates required to implement them. For example, a direct implementation of
the logic expression ABB + BC + C appears to take five 2-input gates as seen
from Figure 5.22. The implementation used in Figure 5.22 assumes that both
TRUE and complement forms of each variable are available as inputs. In other
words, for each variable X, we assume that both X and X are available as inputs.
Otherwise, we would need two additional inverters.
To reduce the number of gates required for its implementation, we can
simplify the expression ABB + BC + C as follows: We first collect terms as
