As computer power grows, map-matching navigation is becoming more important. On aircraft, mapping radars
and optical sensors present a visual image of the terrain to the crew. Automatic map-matchers have been built,
since the 1960s, that correlate the observed image to stored images, choosing the closest match to update the
dead-reckoned  state  vector.  More  commonly,  aircraft  and  cruise  missiles  measure  the  vertical  proﬁle  of  the
terrain below the vehicle and match it to a stored proﬁle. Matching proﬁles, perhaps hourly, reduces the long-
term drift of their inertial navigators. The proﬁle of the terrain is measured by subtracting the readings of a
baro-inertial altimeter (calibrated for altitude above sea level) and a radar altimeter (measuring terrain clear-
ance). An on-board computer calculates the autocorrelation function between the measured proﬁle and each
of many stored proﬁles on possible parallel paths of the vehicle. The on-board inertial navigator usually contains
a  digital  ﬁlter  that  corrects  the  drift  of  the  azimuth  gyroscope  as  a  sequence  of  ﬁxes  is  obtained.  Hence  the
direction of ﬂight through the stored map is known, saving the considerable computation time that would be
needed  to  correlate  for  an  unknown  azimuth  of  the  ﬂight  path.  Marine  versions  proﬁle  the  seaﬂoor  with  a
sonar and compare the measured proﬁle to stored bottom maps.
