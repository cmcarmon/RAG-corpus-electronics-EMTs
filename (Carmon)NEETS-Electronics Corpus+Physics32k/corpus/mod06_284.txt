TUBE BIASING is the process of placing a dc voltage, usually negative, on the grid. Bias has
several functions in circuit design. Biasing may be divided into two types: fixed and self. Tubes using
fixed bias have a dc voltage applied to their control grids from an external source such as a battery. Self-
