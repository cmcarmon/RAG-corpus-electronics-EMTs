For high-data-rate applications, most fiber optic transmitters use laser diodes as sources. The sources
typically operate in either the 1300-nm or 1550-nm windows. Most high-data-rate applications use LDs as
the optical source and operate in the 1300-nm region. Almost all 1550-nm systems use an LD as the
optical source. 1550-nm transmitters are usually only used in the extremely long distance high-data-rate
