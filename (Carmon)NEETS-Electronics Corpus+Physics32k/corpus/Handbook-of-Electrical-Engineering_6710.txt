The segmentation of units of data into cells introduces tremendous ﬂexibility for handling different types
of  information,  such  as  voice,  data,  image,  and  video,  over  a  single  transmission  facility.  As  a  result,  LANs,
WANs, and MANs based on the ATM paradigm are being designed, and indeed deployed. A signiﬁcant portion
of the deployment activity is a national testbed program, which involves industrial/academia cooperation, under
joint  sponsorship  of  the  National  Science  Foundation  (NSF)  and  the  Defense  Advanced  Research  Projects
Agency  (DARPA).  There  is  also  signiﬁcant  private  investment  in  developing  this  technology;  for  example,
experimental  ATM-based  LANs  are  already  in  place  at  the  Digital  Equipment  Corporation  (DEC)  research
facility in Palo Alto, California. There is some possibility that LANs of this type, rather than of the FDDI type,
will be the dominant means of providing high-speed LAN and LAN-interconnect services.
