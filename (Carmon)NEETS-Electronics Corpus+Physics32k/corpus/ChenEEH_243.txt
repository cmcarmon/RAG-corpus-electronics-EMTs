Most of today’s VRMs use conventional buck or synchronous
rectiﬁer buck topologies. Figure 1.3 shows the conventional
buck circuit, which is the most cost-effective approach.
Usually, Schottky diodes are used as rectiﬁers. The top metal-
oxide-semiconductor ﬁeld effect transitor (MOSFET) transfers
energy from the input, and the bottom rectiﬁer conducts the
inductor current. The control regulates the output voltage by
modulating the conduction interval at the top MOSFET.
Figure 1.4 shows the synchronous rectiﬁer buck circuit. This
topology increases the efﬁciency by replacing the rectiﬁer with
a low Rds(on) MOSFET. The synchronous switch is controlled
by the complementary signal of the top switch’s gate signal.
The synchronous rectiﬁer buck always operates in continuous
current mode. Its transient response is faster than that of a
conventional buck converter. Conventional VRMs use large
output ﬁlter inductances, 2  4 mH, to reduce ripple.
