Considering the case of an outlet perpendicular to the x-direction -

In fully developed flow no changes occurs in flow direction, gradient of all variables except pressure are zero in flow direction
The equations are solved for cells up to NI-1, outside the domain values of flow variables are determined by extrapolation from the interior by assuming zero gradients at the outlet plane
The outlet plane velocities with the continuity correction
