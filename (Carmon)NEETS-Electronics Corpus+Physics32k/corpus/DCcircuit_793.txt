Any voltage dropped across the main current-carrying wires will not be measured by the
voltmeter, and so do not factor into the resistance calculation at all. Measurement accuracy
may be improved even further if the voltmeterâ€™s current is kept to a minimum, either by using a
high-quality (low full-scale current) movement and/or a potentiometric (null-balance) system.
