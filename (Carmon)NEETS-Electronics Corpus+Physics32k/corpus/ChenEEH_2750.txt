D~vvphysical than simple Yee leapfrogging. Errors in D~vvphysical
are caused separately by the space and time discretizations
and can either partially reinforce or cancel each other.
Thus, the use of fourth-order Runge-Kutta may actually
shift the ~vvp(f) proÔ¨Åle away from c, representing an in-
creased D~vvphysical relative to ordinary leapfrogging.
