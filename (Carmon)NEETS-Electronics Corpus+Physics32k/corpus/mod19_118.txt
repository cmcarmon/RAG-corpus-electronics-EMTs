Sometimes the victim may have preliminary symptoms, such as headache, nausea, dizziness, or 
weakness. Breathing will be deep and rapid at first, later shallow and almost absent. Usually the victim 
will be flushed, very dry, and very hot. The pupils will be constricted (pinpoint) and the pulse fast and 
strong. Figure 1-10 compares these symptoms with those of heat exhaustion.
