The questionable cause—also known as causal fallacy, false cause, or non causa pro causa ("non-cause for cause" in Latin)—is a category of informal fallacies in which a cause is incorrectly identified.
An example that clearly states what false cause is can be given by, Every time I go to sleep, the sun goes down. Therefore, my going to sleep causes the sun to set.
Fallacies of questionable cause include:
Circular cause and consequence
Correlation implies causation (cum hoc, ergo propter hoc)
Third-cause fallacy
Wrong direction

Fallacy of the single cause
Post hoc ergo propter hoc
Regression fallacy
Texas sharpshooter fallacy
Jumping to conclusions
