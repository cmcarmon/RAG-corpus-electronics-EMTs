(8.11)
The K(VI − VT) term in Equation 8.11 relates the input voltage to the
current through the MOSFET. Notice that for a given DC bias, the K(VI − VT)
term is a constant. Since the form of Equation 8.11 is similar to that for a
conductance, the K(VI− VT) term is called the incremental transconductance gm
of the MOSFET. Accordingly, we can write
id = gmvi
