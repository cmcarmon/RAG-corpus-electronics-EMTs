You can use truth tables also for other digital circuits, such as a half‚Äêadder 
circuit, which is designed to add two bits and produce an output consisting 
of a sum bit and a carry bit. For instance, for the binary equation 1 + 1 = 10, 
the sum bit is 0 and the carry bit is 1. The truth table for the half adder is 
shown in Figure 11-4.
