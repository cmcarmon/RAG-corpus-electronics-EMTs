Critical factors for the introduction of robotics technology within a corporation are management support
and production personnel acceptance of the technology. Companies such as General Electric have developed
checklists to determine the degree of workforce acceptance. Given that the above two factors are met, a plant
survey is conducted to determine suitability for automation or robotic implementation. Two general categories
of robot applications may be distinguished: (1) a project for a new plant, or (2) placing a robot project in an
existing facility. We focus here on the latter category.
