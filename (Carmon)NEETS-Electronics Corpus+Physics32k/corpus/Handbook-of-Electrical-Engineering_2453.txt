The closed-loop nature of this biasing circuit can be seen by noting that if changes in the JFET parameters
were to cause IDS to increase, the voltage drop across RS would also increase. This will produce an increase in
VGS (in the negative direction for an n-channel JFET), which will act to reduce the increase in  IDS. Thus the
net increase in  IDS will be less due to the feedback voltage drop produced by the ﬂow of IDS through  RS. The
same basic action would, of course, occur for changes in the JFET parameters that would cause IDS to decrease.
Bias Stability
Now let’s examine the stability of the Q point. We will start again with the basic transfer equation as given by
IDS =  IDSS [1 – (VGS/ VP)]2. From this equation the change in the drain current, D IDS , due to changes in  IDSS ,
VGS , and VP can be written as
