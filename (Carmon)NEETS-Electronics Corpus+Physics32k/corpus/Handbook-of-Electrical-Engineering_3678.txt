longitudinal  chain  of  atoms  rotate  in  opposite  directions.  Shtrikman  and  Treves  [1959]  introduced  another
incoherent mode, buckling. These incoherent modes of magnetization reversal within single-domain particles
not only predicted values of coercivity closer to the observed values, but also they could explain why the observed
coercivity values for single-domain particles increased with decreasing particle size [Bate, 1980].
