If you prefer, forgo the 2‐by‐4 legs and make a simple workbench using a door 
and two sawhorses. This way, you can take your workbench apart and store 
it in a corner when you’re not using it. Use bungee cords to secure the door 
to the sawhorses, to prevent accidentally flipping the top of your workbench 
off the sawhorses.
