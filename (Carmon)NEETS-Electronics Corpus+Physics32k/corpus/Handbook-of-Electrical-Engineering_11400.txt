Many specialty probes have been designed for intracavitary examination. Examples include examination of
the fetus with a vaginal probe, the prostate with a rectal probe, and blood vessel walls with intravascular probes.
The  intracavitary  probe  offers  the  advantage  of  decreasing  the  distance  from  the  transducer  to  the  tissue  of
interest and thus decreasing attenuation such that higher frequencies can be used for greater resolution. The
lateral resolution of a focused probe is improved with frequency as discussed in the preceding subsection, but
the  axial  (along  the  ultrasound  beam)  resolution  also  improves  with  frequency.  The  shorter  the  transmitted
pulse, the better the axial resolution. Shorter pulses are generated by sources with a larger bandwidth, which
corresponds to a higher center frequency when the sources have bandwidths which are approximately the same
fraction of the center frequency.
