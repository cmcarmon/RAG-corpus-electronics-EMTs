All materials are composed of atoms, each of which is capable of being ionized. If some form of
energy, such as heat, is applied to a material, some electrons acquire sufficient energy to move to a higher
energy level. As a result, some electrons are freed from their parent atomâ€™s which then becomes ions.
Other forms of energy, particularly light or an electric field, will cause ionization to occur.
