Level 12 implements user processes, which are virtual ma-
chines executing programs. While the level 5 process is primi-
tive and can be completely deﬁned by a state word that records
the contents of the registers in a processor, a level 12 user
process is a signiﬁcant extension. It includes one or more
primitive processes, a virtual memory containing the program
and its workspace, a list of arguments supplied as parameters
when the process was started, a list of objects with which the
process can communicate, and certain other information
about the context in which the process operates.
