via  a  two-stage  process:  Ô¨Årst,  the  document  is  hashed  into  a  (relatively)  short  bit  string,  and  then  the  basic
signature  scheme  is  applied  to  the  resulting  string.  This  practice,  as  well  as  other  usages  of  the  paradigm,  is
sound provided the hashing function belongs to a family of Universal One-Way Hash Functions (cf., [Naor and
Yung, 1989]).
