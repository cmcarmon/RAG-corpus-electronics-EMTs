Masking
The response to visual stimuli is greatly affected by what other visual stimuli are in the immediate neighborhood
(spatially and temporally). An example is the reduced sensitivity of the HVS to noise in areas of high spatial
activity. Another example is the masking of details in a new scene by what was present in the previous scene.
In both cases, the masking phenomenon can be used to improve the quality of image compression systems.
