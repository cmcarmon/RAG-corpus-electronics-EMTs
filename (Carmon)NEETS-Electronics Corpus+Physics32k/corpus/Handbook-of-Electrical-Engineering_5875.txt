The true terminal voltage, e.g., ea for phase a, can be obtained by
combining the direct-axis and quadrature-axis components ed and eq,
respectively, which are given in Eq. (66.1). On each line of Eq. (66.1),
the induced emf is the combination of two sources: the ﬁrst is the rate
of  change  of  the  ﬂux  on  the  same  axis  [(d/dt)ld  on  the  ﬁrst  line,
(d/dt)lq  on  the  second];  the  second  comes  into  effect  only  when  a
disturbance makes the rotor and stator ﬁelds depart from each other
[given by (d/dt)q]. The third term in the voltage equation represents
the ohmic loss associated with the stator winding.
