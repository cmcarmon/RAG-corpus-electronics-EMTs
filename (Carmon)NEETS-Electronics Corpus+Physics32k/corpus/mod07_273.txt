The VALENCE BAND is a band in which the energy level is the same as the valence electrons of 
the atoms. Since the electrons in these levels are attached to the atoms, the electrons are not free to move 
around as are the conduction band electrons. With the proper amount of energy added, however, the 
electrons in the valence band may be elevated to the conduction band energy level. To do this, the 
electrons must cross a gap that exists between the valence band energy level and the conduction band 
energy level. This gap is known as the FORBIDDEN ENERGY BAND or FORBIDDEN GAP. The
