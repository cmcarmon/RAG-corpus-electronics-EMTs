The primary function of the tr switch is to protect the sensitive crystal detectors from the powerful 
transmitter pulse. Even the best tr switches allow some power to leak through; but when the switch is 
functioning properly, leakage power is so small that it does not damage the crystal. However, the useful 
life of a tr tube is limited because the amount of leakage to the receiver increases with use.
