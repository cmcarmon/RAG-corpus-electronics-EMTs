One  approach  to  compression  is  to  reduce  the  spatial  and/or  temporal  sampling  rate  and  the  number  of
quantization  levels.  Unfortunately,  if  the  sampling  is  too  low  and  the  quantization  too  coarse,  aliasing,  con-
touring, and ﬂickering will occur. These distortions are often much greater than the distortions introduced by
more sophisticated techniques at the same compression rate. Compression systems can generally be modeled
by the block diagram shown in Fig. 17.14. The ﬁrst stage of the compression system is the mapper. This is an
operation  in  which  the  input  pixels  are  mapped  into  a  representation  that  can  be  more  effectively  encoded.
This stage is generally reversible. The second stage is the quantizer and performs the same type of operation
as  described  earlier.  This  stage  is  not  reversible.  The  ﬁnal  stage  attempts  to  remove  any  remaining  statistical
redundancy. This stage is reversible and is typically achieved with one of the information-preserving coders.
