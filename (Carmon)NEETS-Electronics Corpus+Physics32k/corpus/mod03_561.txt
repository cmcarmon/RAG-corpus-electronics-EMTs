A RELAY is an electromagnetic control device that differs from the solenoid in that the solenoid
uses a movable core (plunger) while the relay has fixed core. Relays are classified as CONTROL
RELAYS, which control low power COMMON circuits and POWER RELAYS or CONTACTORS
which control high power circuits.
