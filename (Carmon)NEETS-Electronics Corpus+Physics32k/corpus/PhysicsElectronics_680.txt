The presence of resistance at the output of the op-amp limits the current that the ampliﬁer
can deliver into a load, as shown in ﬁgure 6.33. Current limiting is a nonlinear property that
invalidates the two normal approximation rules. When an op-amp is driven into a current-
limiting condition it goes into saturation and becomes a constant current source. For a large
load the output signal will be voltage-limited. A similar breakdown of the rules occurs when
the ampliﬁer is driven into voltage-limited operation.
