Figure 2.2: Graphically, the complex exponential scribes a circle in the complex plane as time evolves.
Its real and imaginary parts are sinusoids. The rate at which the signal goes around the circle is the
frequency f and the time taken to go around is the period T . A fundamental relationship is T = 1
f .
