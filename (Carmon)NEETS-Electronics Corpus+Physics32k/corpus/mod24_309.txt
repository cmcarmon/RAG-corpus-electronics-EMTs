Ribbon cables are also hard to handle. Individual fibers are highly susceptible to damage when
separated from the ribbon. This susceptibility to fiber damage during fiber breakout makes it necessary to
perform multifiber connections. Multifiber connections can introduce single points of failure in multiple
systems. The use of multifiber terminations also introduces maintenance, reconfiguration, and repair
problems. Currently, the Navy does not recommend the use of ribbon cables in shipboard systems.
