Suppliers’ catalogs typically list the resistance of thermistors as measured at 
25 degrees Celsius (77° F). Measure the resistance of the thermistor yourself 
with a multimeter at a few different temperatures (see Chapter 16 for more 
about using multimeters). These measurements enable you to calibrate the 
thermistor, or get the exact relationship between temperature and resistance. 
If you’re not sure of a thermistor’s type, you can figure that out by identifying 
whether the value increases or decreases with a rise in temperature.
