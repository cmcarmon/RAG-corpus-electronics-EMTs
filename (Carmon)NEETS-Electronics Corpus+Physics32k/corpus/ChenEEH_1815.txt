The network ensures that adequate bandwidth and packet
processing resources are available to handle the requested level
of trafﬁc. The controlled load service does not make use of
speciﬁc target values for delay or loss. Acceptance of a con-
trolled-load request is merely a commitment to provide the
ﬂow with a service closely equivalent to that provided to
uncontrolled trafﬁc under lightly loaded conditions. Over all
timescales signiﬁcantly larger than the burst time, a controlled
load service ﬂow may experience little or no average packet
queuing delay and little or no congestion loss.
