Conductors within equipment must be kept in place to present a neat appearance and aid in tracing 
the conductors when alterations or repairs are required. This is done by LACING the conductors into wire 
bundles called cables. An example of lacing is shown in figure 2-39. When conductors are properly laced, 
they support each other and form a neat, single cable.
