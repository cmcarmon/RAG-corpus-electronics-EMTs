Now look at view (B). The input signal is a high-frequency signal. Now XC is low and XL  is high.
XL1 and XL2 now drop part of the input and output signals. At the same time XC4  and XC5 tend to "short"
or "pass" the input and output signals to signal ground. The net effect is that both the input and output
signals are reduced. Notice that the output signal is smaller in amplitude than the input signal.
