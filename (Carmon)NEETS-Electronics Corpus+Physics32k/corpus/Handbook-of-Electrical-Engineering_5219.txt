The  electric  energy  demand  of  the  world  is  continuously  increasing,  and  most  of  the  energy  is  generated  by
conventional power plants, which remain the only cost-effective method for generating large quantities of energy.
Power plants utilize energy stored in the earth and convert it to electrical energy that is distributed and used
by customers. This process converts most of the energy into heat, which increases the entropy of the earth. In
this sense, power plants deplete the earth’s energy supply. Efﬁcient operation becomes increasingly important
to conserve energy.
