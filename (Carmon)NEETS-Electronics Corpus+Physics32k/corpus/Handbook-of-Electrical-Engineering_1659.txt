It is important to emphasize that both the linear dynamical system and the measurement model can be time-
varying, and both the process noise and measurement noise can be nonstationary. That is, all of the following
matrices can vary with time: Φ
k, Hk, Qk, and Rk. Also, the discrete times at which measurements are made (tk
for k = 1, 2, …) are completely arbitrary; that is, the sample rate can be nonuniform.
