For a single damped mass-spring system, the Q factor represents the effect of simplified viscous damping or drag, where the damping force or drag force is proportional to velocity. The formula for the Q factor is:




Q
=



M
k

D


,



{\displaystyle Q={\frac {\sqrt {Mk}}{D}},\,}

where M is the mass, k is the spring constant, and D is the damping coefficient, defined by the equation Fdamping = âˆ’Dv, where v is the velocity.
