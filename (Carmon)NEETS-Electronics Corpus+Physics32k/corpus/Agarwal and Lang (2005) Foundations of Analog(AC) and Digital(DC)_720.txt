F I G U R E 5.9 Senders must
output voltages between VOH
and 5 V to send a logical 1, and
between 0 V and VOL for a
logical 0. Correspondingly,
receivers can interpret values
greater than VIH as a logical high,
and values lower than VIL as a
logical low. The hashed regions are
the valid ranges for senders and
receivers.
