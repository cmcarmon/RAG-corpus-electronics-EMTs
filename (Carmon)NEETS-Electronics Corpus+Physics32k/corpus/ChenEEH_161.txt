We have several possibilities for plotting them: the horizontal
axis can be linear or logarithmic, the amplitude responses can be
in absolute values, jFij ¼ jF(jvi)j, or jFi1dBj ¼ 20 logjFij (in
decibels, which is a logarithmic scale). The four possible plots
of the same responses are in Figures 4.13(A) through 4.13(D).
