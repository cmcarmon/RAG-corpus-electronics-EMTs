Stability and Accuracy
Because  the  DF  method  is  an  approximate  procedure,  it  is  desirable  to  judge  its  accuracy.  Predicting  that  a
system will be stable, when in practice it is not, may have unfortunate consequences. Many attempts have been
made to solve this problem, but those obtained are difÔ¨Åcult to apply or produce too conservative results [Mess
and Bergen, 1975].
