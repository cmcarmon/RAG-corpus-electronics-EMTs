PIC architecture 
 
PIC  microcontrollers  first  became  popular  in  the 
mid-1990s.  Since 
the  range  of  devices 
available  has  increased  dramatically.  Nowadays  a 
PIC  device  exists  for  almost  any  embedded 
application,  from  small  6-pin  devices  ideal  for 
simple  control  applications,  through  to  powerful 
high-speed  devices  packed  with  I/O  features  and 
large amounts of memory.  
  PIC are based on RISC (Reduced Instruction Set 
Computer) architecture and, as a consequence, they 
use  a  relatively  small  number  of  instructions.  In 
fact, some PIC chips have as few as 33 instructions 
compared 
general-purpose 
microprocessors  (such  as  the  Z80)  that  may  have 
several  hundred.  Because  it  is  only  necessary  to 
remember a relatively small number of commands, 
it is relatively easy to learn to program a PIC using 
its  own  assembly  language  (note,  however,  that  it 
may take several  instructions to achieve on a PIC 
what  can  be  done  in  a  single  instruction  using  a 
fully-fledged  microprocessor).  And,  if  you  donâ€™t 
like  the  idea  of  having  to  learn  assembly  code 
programming you can can make use of C, BASIC 
or  Flowcode  (a  language  based  almost  entirely  on 
flowcharts).
