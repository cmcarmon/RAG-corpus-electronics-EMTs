The  voltage  source  method  of  biasing  has  several  major  drawbacks.  Since VP
will have the opposite polarity of the drain supply voltage VDD, the gate bias voltage
will require a second power supply. For the case of an n-channel JFET, VDD will
come from a positive supply voltage and VGG must come from a separate negative
power supply voltage or battery. A second, and perhaps more serious, problem is
the “open-loop” nature of this biasing method. The JFET parameters of IDDS and
VP will exhibit very substantial unit-to-unit variations, often by as much as a 2:1
factor. There is also a signiﬁcant temperature dependence of  IDDS and VP . These
variations will lead to major shifts in the position of the Q point and the resulting
distortion of the signal. A much better biasing method is shown in Fig. 24.8.
