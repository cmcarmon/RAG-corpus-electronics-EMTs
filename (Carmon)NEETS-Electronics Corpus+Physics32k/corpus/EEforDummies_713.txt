Probing IC pinouts
The pins on an IC package provide connections to the tiny integrated cir-
cuits inside, but alas, the pins are not labeled on the package so you have to 
rely on the datasheet for the particular IC to make the proper connections. 
Among other things, the datasheet provides you with the ICâ€™s pinout, which 
describes the function of each pin.
