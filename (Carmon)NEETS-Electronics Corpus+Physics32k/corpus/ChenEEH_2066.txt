In He and Lee (1990) and He and Ding (1992), we de-
veloped an axiomatic approach of using temporal logic to
analyze PrTNs. The essential
ideas are to derive system-
dependent temporal inference rules from PrTN transitions.
These inference rules capture the causal relationships of tran-
sition ﬁrings. Thus, executions of a PrTN become temporal
logic deductions in the derived axiomatic system. We have
proved that safety properties (Manna and Pnueli, 1992) can
be effectively analyzed using this axiomatic approach. Further-
more, we have shown how to analyze liveness properties
(Manna and Pnueli, 1992) using the above temporal formula
(He, 1991).
Given TN ¼ (NG, Sig , V , H, Type, AN , M0, f ), we can
obtain the following system-dependent temporal axiom sys-
