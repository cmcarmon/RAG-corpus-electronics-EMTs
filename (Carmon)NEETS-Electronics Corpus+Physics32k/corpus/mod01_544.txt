A short circuit is an accidental path of low resistance which passes an abnormally high amount of
current. A short circuit exists whenever the resistance of a circuit or the resistance of a part of a circuit
drops in value to almost zero ohms. A short often occurs as a result of improper wiring or broken
insulation.
