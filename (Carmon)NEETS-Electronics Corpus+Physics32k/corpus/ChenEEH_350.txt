derivatives of constant ﬁeld scaling. In constant-ﬁeld scaling,
the supply voltage and the device dimensions (both lateral and
vertical) are scaled by the same factor, k such that the electric
ﬁeld remains unchanged. This results in scaling of the drain
current or current drive. At the same time, gate capacitance is
also scaled due to reduced device size. This provides a reduc-
tion in the gate charging time, which directly translates into
higher speed. Furthermore, power dissipation per transistor is
also reduced.
