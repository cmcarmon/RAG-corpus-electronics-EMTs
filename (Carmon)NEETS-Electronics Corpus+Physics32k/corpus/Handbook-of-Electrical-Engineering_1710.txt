FIGURE 17.3
This image demonstrates the effects of quantization error. The upper left image is a coronary artery image
with 8 bits (256 levels or shades of gray) per pixel. The upper right image has 4 bits/pixel (16 levels). The lower left image
has 3 bits/pixel (8 levels). The lower right image has 2 bits/pixel (4 levels). Note the false contouring in the images as the
number of possible levels in the pixel representation is reduced. This false contouring is the quantization error, and as the
number of levels increases the quantization error decreases because fewer mistakes are being made in the representation.
