Integrated circuits do have some disadvantages. 
They cannot handle large amounts of current or volt-
age. High current generates excessive heat, damaging 
the device. High voltage breaks down the insulation  
between  the  various  internal  components.  Most  
integrated circuits are low-power devices, consuming 
from 5 to 15 volts in the milliamp range. This results 
in power consumption of less than 1 watt.
