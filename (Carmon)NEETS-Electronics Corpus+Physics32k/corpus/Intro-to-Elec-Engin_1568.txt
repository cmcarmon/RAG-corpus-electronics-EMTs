15.2.36 Suppose that a video signal, having W = 5 MHz,
is transmitted via FM with f = 20 MHz. For
1/100 ≤ B/fc ≤ 1/10, determine the bounds on
∼= 2(ω + 2Wf )
the carrier frequency. Use WFM
for ω >> Wf (for wide-band FM).
15.2.37 A TDM signal, like that of Figure 14.2.9(b), is
formed by sampling 5 voice signals at fs = 8 kHz.
The signal is then transmitted via FM on a radio
channel with 400-kHz bandwidth. Estimate the
maximum allowable frequency deviation f [use
