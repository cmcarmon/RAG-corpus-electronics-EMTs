isn’t broken, electrons will continue to ﬂow in the circuit. Following the metaphor of water
moving through a pipe, this continuous, uniform ﬂow of electrons through the circuit is called
a current. So long as the voltage source keeps ”pushing” in the same direction, the electron ﬂow
will continue to move in the same direction in the circuit. This single-direction ﬂow of electrons
is called a Direct Current, or DC. In the second volume of this book series, electric circuits are
explored where the direction of current switches back and forth: Alternating Current, or AC.
But for now, we’ll just concern ourselves with DC circuits.
