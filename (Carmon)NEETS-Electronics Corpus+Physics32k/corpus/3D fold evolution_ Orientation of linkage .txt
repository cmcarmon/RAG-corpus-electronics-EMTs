In an area affected by regional stress, most of the faults and folds are aligned along strike. In forced folds, linkage of folds is strongly associated with linkage of the underlying faults. Growth and displacement of faults are affected by not only the far-field stress of the region but also the position of faults relative to each other. This is a result of a reloading positive feedback mechanism, which suggests that the stress build-up in the population of faults that are aligned along strike are much faster than those located in stress shadow (i.e. transverse to the main alignments), and thus the higher frequency of rupture and growth rates in faults that are optimally aligned. Conversely, the faults that are located in stress shadow are relaxed and have a lower frequency of rupture and growth rates. As localization of deformation among faults continues, some faults may concentrate the stress and upon linking with other faults form a main fault that accommodates most of the displacement in the region. On the other hand, the faults that orient in the stress shadow will decrease in growth rates and even become inactive in the long term. As a result, in a region with pervasive compressional stress, two merged fold segments are usually aligned along-strike, as the folds would probably be rendered inactive if they are not aligned in such favorable ways.
