in which the initial signal is speciﬁed by xo = x. A subsequence of this sequence always exists which converges
to an element of the set intersection C = C 1˙C 2˙ … ˙ Cm provided that: (1) the d (xk,xr) < d(xk–1,xr), where
xr ˛  X designates a reference signal which is often the origin of X, and (2) the set of signals y ˛  X that satisfy
the inequality d(y,xr) £ d(x,xr) deﬁnes a closed and bounded set.
