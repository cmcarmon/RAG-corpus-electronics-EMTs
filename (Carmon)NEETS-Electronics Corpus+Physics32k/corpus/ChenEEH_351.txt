Constant Ô¨Åeld scaling provides a good framework for
CMOS scaling without degrading reliability. However, there
are several parameters, such as the kT/q and an energy gap, that
do not scale with reduced voltages or dimensions and present
challenges in device design. Since the junction built-in poten-
tial, fbi, and the surface potential, cs, are both determined by
the bandgap, they do not scale either. Consequently, depletion
region widths do not scale as much as other parameters, which
results in worsened short channel effects.
