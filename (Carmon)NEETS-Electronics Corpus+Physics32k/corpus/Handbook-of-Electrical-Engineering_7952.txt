An important economy is possible by making use of the fact that for many sets of functions the OR array
is not needed for the sharing of products between outputs. Figure 81.43 shows an example of such a function,
a  multiplexer.  Such  a  function  can  be  implemented  by  a  PLA  with  only  an  AND  array;  the  OR  array  has
degenerated into a set of OR gates. The drawback is that the PLA is no longer universal, because a ﬁxed allocation
of products to OR gates has to be chosen. PLAs of this structure have become known as PAL devices or just
PALs.  (The  term “PAL,”  which  stands  for “programmable  array  logic,”  is  a  trademark  of  Advanced  Micro
Devices, Inc.). There are many applications where the product term sharing capability of the full PLA is wasted,
and  a  PAL-based  solution  is  more  economical.  Also,  because  there  is  only  one  programmable  array,  the
propagation  delay  will  generally  be  smaller.  Address  decoding  in  microprocessor  systems  is  a  very  common
application of combinational PAL devices.
