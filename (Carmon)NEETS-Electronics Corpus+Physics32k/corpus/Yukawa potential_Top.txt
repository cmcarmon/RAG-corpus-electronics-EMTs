In particle and atomic physics, a Yukawa potential (also called a screened Coulomb potential) is a potential of the form

{\displaystyle V_{\text{Yukawa}}(r)=-g^{2}{\frac {e^{-kmr}}{r}},}

where g is a magnitude scaling constant, i.e. is the amplitude of potential, m is the mass of the particle, r is the radial distance to the particle, and k is another scaling constant, so that 1/km is the range. The potential is monotone increasing in r and it is negative, implying the force is attractive. In the SI system, the unit of the Yukawa potential is (1/m).
The Coulomb potential of electromagnetism is an example of a Yukawa potential with e−kmr equal to 1 everywhere. This can be interpreted as saying that the photon mass m is equal to 0.
In interactions between a meson field and a fermion field, the constant g is equal to the gauge coupling constant between those fields. In the case of the nuclear force, the fermions would be a proton and another proton or a neutron.
