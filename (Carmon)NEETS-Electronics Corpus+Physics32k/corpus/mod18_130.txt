An important advantage of a monopulse-tracking radar over radar using conical scan is that the
instantaneous angular measurements are not subject to errors caused by target SCINTILLATION.
Scintillation can occur as the target maneuvers or moves and the radar pulses bounce off different areas of
the target. This causes random reflectivity and may lead to tracking errors. Monopulse tracking radar is
not subject to this type of error because each pulse provides an angular measurement without regard to the
