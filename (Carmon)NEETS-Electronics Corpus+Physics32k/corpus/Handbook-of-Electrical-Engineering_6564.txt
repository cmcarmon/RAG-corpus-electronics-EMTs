Photodetector
This device converts an incoming optical beam into an electrical current. In ﬁber receivers, the most commonly
used photodetectors are semiconductor pin photodiodes and avalanche photodiodes (APD). Important detector
characteristics are speed of response, spectral response, internal gain, and noise. Because avalanche photodiodes
have internal gain, they are preferred for highly sensitive receivers. Both Ge and InGaAs photodiodes respond
in  the  preferred  second  and  third  ﬁber  windows.  InGaAs  performs  better  at  low  signal  levels  because  it  has
smaller values of dark current (that is, it is less noisy).
