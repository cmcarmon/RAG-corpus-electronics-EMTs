In this way, the real and imaginary parts remain separate.
• The product of j and a real number is an imaginary number: ja. The product of j and an imaginary
number is a real number: j (jb) = −b because j2 = −1. Consequently, multiplying a complex number
by j rotates the number’s position by 90 degrees.
Exercise 2.1
(Solution on p. 30.)
Use the deﬁnition of addition to show that the real and imaginary parts can be expressed as a
sum/diﬀerence of a complex number and its conjugate. Re [z] = z+z∗
