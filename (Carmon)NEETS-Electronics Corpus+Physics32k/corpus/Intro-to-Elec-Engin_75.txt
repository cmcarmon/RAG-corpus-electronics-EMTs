Practical resistors are manufactured in standard values, various resistance tolerances, several
power ratings (as will be explained shortly), and in a number of different forms of construction.
The three basic construction techniques are composition type, which uses carbon or graphite and
is molded into a cylindrical shape, wire-wound type, in which a length of enamel-coated wire
is wrapped around an insulating cylinder, and metal-ﬁlm type, in which a thin layer of metal is
vacuum deposited. Table 1.2.2 illustrates the standard color-coded bands used for evaluating
resistance and their interpretation for the common carbon composition type. Sometimes a ﬁfth
band is also present to indicate reliability. Black is the least reliable color and orange is 1000
times more reliable than black.
