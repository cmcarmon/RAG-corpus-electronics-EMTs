The universal Impedance Bridge, Model 250DE (shown in figure 4-18) is used to measure
resistance, capacitance, and inductance (RCL) values. It is also used to make other special tests, such as
determining the turns ratio of transformers and capacitor quality tests. This instrument is self-contained,
except for a source of line power, and has an approximate 500-hour battery life expectancy. It has its own
source of 1,000-hertz bridge current with a sensitive bridge balance indicator and an adjustable source of
direct current for electrolytic capacitor and resistance testing. The bridge also contains a meter with
suitable ranges to test for current leakage on electrolytic capacitors.
