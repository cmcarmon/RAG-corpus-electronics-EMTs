To date, only one land vehicle has officially travelled at supersonic speed, this being ThrustSSC, driven by Andy Green, which holds the world land speed record having acheived an average speed on it's bi-directional run of 763 mph in the Black Rock Desert on 15 October 1997.
Richard Noble, Andy Green and a team of engineers are currently planning to break this record in 2019 at Hakskeen Pan in South Africa with the Bloodhound SSC hybrid jet and rocket propelled car.
