The partial fraction expansion method is based on the appealing notion of equivalently expressing this rational
transform as a sum of n elementary transforms whose corresponding inverse Laplace transforms (i.e., generating
signals) are readily found in standard Laplace transform pair tables. This method entails the simple Ô¨Åve-step
process as outlined in Table 6.3. A description of each of these steps and their implementation is now given.
