The same parameters (voltages and currents) that affect frequency stability also affect amplitude 
stability. Output amplitude may be kept relatively constant by ensuring that the feedback is large enough 
that the collector current is maintained at the proper level. Feedback used in this manner makes the output 
voltage directly proportional to the supply voltage. Thus, regulation of the supply voltage ensures good 
amplitude stability.
