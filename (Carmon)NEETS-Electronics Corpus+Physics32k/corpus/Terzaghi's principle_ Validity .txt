Though the first 5 assumptions are either likely to hold, or deviation will have no discernible effect, experimental results contradict the final 3. Darcy's Law does not seem to hold at high hydraulic gradients, and both the coefficients of permeability and volume compressibility decrease during consolidation. This is due to the non-linearity of the relationship between void ratio and effective stress, although for small stress increments assumption 7 is reasonable. Finally, the relationship between void ratio and effective stress is not independent of time, again proven by experimental results.
