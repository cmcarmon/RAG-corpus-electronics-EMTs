The displacement of a body has two components: a rigid-body displacement and a deformation.
A rigid-body displacement consists of a simultaneous translation and rotation of the body without changing its shape or size.
Deformation implies the change in shape and/or size of the body from an initial or undeformed configuration

A change in the configuration of a continuum body can be described by a displacement field. A displacement field is a vector field of all displacement vectors for all particles in the body, which relates the deformed configuration with the undeformed configuration. Relative displacement between particles occurs if and only if deformation has occurred. If displacement occurs without deformation, then it is deemed a rigid-body displacement.
