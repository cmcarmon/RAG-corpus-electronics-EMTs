the Gaussian pulse (i ¼ 90), where S exceeds 1.0, rather than
along the entirety of the trailing edge. Despite this localization
of the source of the instability, the noise again grows exponen-
tially with time-step number n. In this case, the noise propa-
gates symmetrically in both directions from the unstable point.
Ultimately, the noise again ﬁlls the entire grid, overwhelms the
desired numerical results for the propagating Gaussian pulse,
and causes run-time ﬂoating-point overﬂows.
