The notion of a port is much more general than its use in electronic cir-
cuit analysis would indicate. Many physical systems, such as mechanical, fluid,
or thermal systems can be characterized by their behavior at a few ports. Fur-
thermore, as depicted in Table 1.1 they have through and across parameters
analogous to currents and voltages. Circuit models for these systems would use
voltages and currents to model the corresponding through and across variables
in those systems.
