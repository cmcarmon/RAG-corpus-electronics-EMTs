Of constant concern to the operators of power systems is the reliability of equipment. This has become more
important as systems are run harder. In the past, reliability was ensured by building in reserve equipment which
was either connected in parallel with other similar devices or could be easily connected in the event of a failure.
Not only that, knowledge of the capabilities of materials has increased so that equipment can be built with a
more certain level of reliability.
