The term PITCH is used to describe the frequency of a sound. An object that vibrates many times per
second produces a sound with a high pitch, as with a police whistle. The slow vibrations of the heavier
strings of a violin cause a low-pitched sound. Thus, the frequency of the wave determines pitch. When the
frequency is low, sound waves are long; when it is high, the waves are short. A sound can be so high in
frequency that the waves reaching the ear cannot be heard. Likewise, some frequencies are so low that the
eardrums do not convert them into sound. The range of sound that the human ear can detect varies with
each individual.
