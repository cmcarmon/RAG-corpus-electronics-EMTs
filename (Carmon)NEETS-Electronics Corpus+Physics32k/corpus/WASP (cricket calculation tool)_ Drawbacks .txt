If a batsman gets retired hurt, the model will not work well as it does not know the position in which the retired hurt batsman will come to bat again. This happened in a match between England and New Zealand, as injured Martin Guptill came to the crease again in the ninth position and gave a staggering performance which is unusual for a ninth position batsman and helped his team to win the match.
WASP also fails when a team beats the predicted score batting first, as was the case when Black Caps beat the predicted score at Otago University Oval of 270 in the fourth game of the seven-game series against Sri Lanka by a large margin, when Grant Elliott and Luke Ronchi set the record for their highest 6th wicket partnership to set a score of 360/5, at which case, runs per over rate will resume showing. The team batting second will not have WASP showing if the likelihood of winning falls below 5% before the 5th over. These reasons make this unpopular outside of Sky broadcasts. Two days later, due to a greener surface, the predicted score at the same ground drops to 257 at the start of the match, which Black Caps still went on to post a score of 315/8. After those matches, Sky abandoned showing this statistic in future matches, and it was not featured during 2015 Cricket World Cup. WASP, however, was featured again in NatWest T20 Blast, ODI and Twenty20 broadcasts in England.
