The gain parameters gm1 and gm2 for the MOSFETs depend on the operating-point
values of the currents through them. Assuming that the current through Ri is negligible,
by symmetry, we find that the current I divides equally between the two MOSFETs.
Thus each has an operating-point current equal to I/2. From the SCS model for the
MOSFETs, given VT and K, we can thus find the bias input voltages VGS1 and VGS2 in
terms of I. In turn, the respective gains gm1 and gm2 can be determined in terms of VGS1
and VGS2, which are themselves functions of I.
