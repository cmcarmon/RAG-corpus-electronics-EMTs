7.2.11 Two identical junction diodes whose volt–ampere
relation is given by Equation (7.2.1) in which
IS = 0.1 µA, VT = 25 mV, and η = 2, are
connected as shown in Figure P7.2.11. Determine
the current in the circuit and the voltage across
each diode.
7.2.12 Consider the diode of Problem 7.2.6 with Von =
0.7 V and the model of Figure 7.2.5(a). Evaluate
the effect of Von on the answer.
