If we replace the human in an auto with a mass suspended in an elastic mounting system, as shown 
in figure 3-19, any acceleration of the auto will cause movement of the mass relative to the auto. The 
amount of displacement is proportional to the force causing the acceleration. The direction the mass 
moves is always opposite to the direction of the auto's acceleration.
