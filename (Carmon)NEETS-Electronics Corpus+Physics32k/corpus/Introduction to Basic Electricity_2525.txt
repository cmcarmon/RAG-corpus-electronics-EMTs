signal being checked. The volts/cm switch is used to 
adjust the amplitude of the input signal. If the signal is 
too large, the vertical amplifier distorts it; if the signal 
is too small, it is amplified. This control is calibrated 
to match the CRT faceplate. Where this control is set 
depends on the amplitude of the signal on the CRT.
