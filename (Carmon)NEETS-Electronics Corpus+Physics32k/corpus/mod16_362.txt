The two instruments you will use most often to check continuity, or to measure the resistance of a
circuit or circuit component, are the OHMMETER and the MEGGER (MEGOHMMETER). The
ohmmeter is widely used to measure resistance and to check the continuity of electrical circuits and
devices. Its range usually extends to only a few megohms. The megger is widely used for measuring
insulation resistance, such as that between a wire and the outer surface of its insulation, and the insulation
resistance of cables and insulators. The range of a megger can be extended to more than 1,000 megohms.
