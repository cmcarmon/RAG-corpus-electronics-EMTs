Chromatic dispersion is measured using EIA/TIA-455-168 in the time domain. Chromatic dispersion
is also measured in the frequency domain using EIA/TIA-455-169 and EIA/TIA-455-175. These methods
measure the composite optical fiber material and waveguide dispersion. To understand the contribution
that material and waveguide dispersive mechanisms have on multimode and single mode fiber dispersion,
refer to chapter 2. In this chapter we limit the discussion on chromatic dispersion to the time domain
method described in EIA/TIA-455-168.
