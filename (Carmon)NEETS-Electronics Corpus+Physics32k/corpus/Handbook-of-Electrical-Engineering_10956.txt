where  V  and  Ve are  membrane  voltage  and  external  voltage,  respectively,  at  longitudal  position  x.  Equation
pdDx,
(113.9)  can  be  derived  from  ﬁrst  principles,  or  can  be  obtained  from  (113.8)  by  substituting Cm  =  cm
Ga =  pd 2/(4r
pdDx,  where  d  is  the  ﬁber  diameter,  Dx  is  the  longitudinal  increment,  r
i  is  the
axoplasm resistivity (in Wcm) internal to the ﬁber, cm is capacitance per unit area, and gm is conductance times
unit  area.  Continuous  and  discrete  spatial  derivatives  are  connected  by  ¶2V/ ¶x2  »  (Vn–1  –  2Vn+  Vn+1)/Dx2;
m is the member time constant given by cm/gm; l is the membrane space
¶2Ve/¶x2 » (Ve,n–1 – 2Ve,n + Ve,n+1)/Dx 2; t
constant  given  by l =  (rm/ri )1/2  =  (dr
m/4r
m  is  the  membrane  speciﬁc  resistance  (in Wcm2).  An
additional relationship is Ii,n = V/Gm.
