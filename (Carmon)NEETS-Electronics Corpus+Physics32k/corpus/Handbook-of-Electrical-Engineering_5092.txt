where rij is the reﬂectance matrix. Ei^ and Ei// are, respectively, the perpendicular (TE) and parallel (TM) electric
ﬁeld components of the incident light waves (with respect to the plane of incidence). Er^ and Er// are, respectively,
the perpendicular and parallel electric ﬁeld components of the reﬂected light waves.
