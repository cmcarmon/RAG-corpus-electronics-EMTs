Operational amplifiers are used with degenerative (or negative) feedback which reduces the gain of
the operational amplifier but greatly increases the stability of the circuit. In the closed-loop configuration,
the output signal is applied back to one of the input terminals. This feedback is always degenerative
(negative). In other words, the feedback signal always opposes the effects of the original input signal. One
result of degenerative feedback is that the inverting and noninverting inputs to the operational amplifier
will be kept at the same potential.
