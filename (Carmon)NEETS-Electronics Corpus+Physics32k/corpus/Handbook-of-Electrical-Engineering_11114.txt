For example, the Ca2+ ion has a resonance frequency of 16 Hz in a dc ﬁeld of 21.0 mT. However, it has been
pointed out that the collision frequency in the physiological environment would be very much larger than the
cyclotron frequency and would therefore wipe out any resonance motion, that the usually hydrated ions would
have a total mass larger than m, and that the energy gain caused by an alternating ﬁeld of frequency w
c (as in
a cyclotron) would require an orbital radius larger by many orders of magnitude than a typical cell radius [Polk,
1986]. Another theory postulates that the binding of Ca2+ to the protein calmodulin (ubiquitous in all verte-
brates) should be affected by magnetic ﬁelds at frequencies w
c/n (where n is an integer) [Lednev, 1991;
Adair, 1992]. This mechanism involves Zeeman splitting at ELF, due to B0, of infrared vibrational modes that
are chemically or thermally excited.
