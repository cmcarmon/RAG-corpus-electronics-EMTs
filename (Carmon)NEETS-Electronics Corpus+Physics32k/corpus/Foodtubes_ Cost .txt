Due to previously mentioned trenchless no-dig technology, Foodtubes pipelines are relatively economically friendly. The company estimates that construction of the Foodtubes system will cost approximately $5 million USD per kilometer of pipeline. The current production cost for a four-lane highway is $28 million per kilometer. For the current plan in the town of Croydon, construction costs are estimated at £400 million with estimated profits (from money saved) of £80 million per year. Thus, a Foodtubes system in a town such as Croydon would pay for itself in approximately 5 years.
