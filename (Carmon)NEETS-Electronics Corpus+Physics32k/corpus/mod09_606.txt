The circuit in figure 4-30 will help show the relationships of R and XC more clearly. The square 
wave applied to the circuit is 100 volts peak at a frequency of 1 kilohertz. The odd harmonics will be 3 
kilohertz, 5 kilohertz, 7 kilohertz, etc. Table 4-1 shows the values of XC and R offered to several
