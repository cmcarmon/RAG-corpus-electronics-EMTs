Filters are used in a variety of signal processing circuits.
Chapter 4 provides an account of latest advances in the design
and application of active Ô¨Ålters in microsystems. Although
bipolar junction transistors (BJTs) are not as prominent as
MOSFETs, nevertheless they are used in a variety of mixed-
signal and poweer circuits. Chapter 5 discusses the state-of-
the-art on diodes and BJTs in these circuits. Chapter 6 provides
insight into basic semiconductor material physics and how it
relates to device performance and reliability. The section con-
cludes with a detailed account of the evolution and current
state-of-the-art of power semiconductor devices for discrete as
well as integrated applications. Power semiconductor devices
are playing an increasingly important role in microsystems,
especially for performing the power management function.
