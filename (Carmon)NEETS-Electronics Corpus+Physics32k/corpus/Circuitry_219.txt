Procedure 
 
Connect the circuit  shown in Fig. 4.24 (capacitive 
reactance).  Set 
the  voltmeter  and  ammeter 
respectively to the 2 V and 20 mA  ranges. Set the 
signal  generator  to  produce  a  sine  wave  output  at 
100 Hz.  
  Adjust the signal generator output voltage so that 
the  voltmeter  reads  exactly  1  V  before  measuring 
and recording the current (this should be less than 1 
mA). Repeat this measurement at frequencies from 
200 Hz to 1 kHz in steps of 100 Hz. At each step, 
check 
exactly  
1 V (adjust, if necessary). 
  Connect the circuit shown in Fig. 4.25 (inductive 
reactance).  As  before,  set 
the  voltmeter  and 
ammeter to the 2 V and 20 mA  ranges and set the 
signal  generator  to  produce  a  sine  wave  output  at 
100 Hz.  
  Adjust  the  signal  generator  output  for  a  voltage 
of exactly 1 V before measuring and recording the 
current.  Repeat  this  measurement  at  frequencies 
over from 200 Hz to 1 kHz in steps of 100 Hz. At
