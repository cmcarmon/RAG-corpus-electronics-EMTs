Although the semiconductor was late in reaching its present development, its story began long before
the electron tube. Historically, we can go as far back as 1883 when Michael Faraday discovered that
silver sulfide, a semiconductor, has a negative temperature coefficient. The term negative temperature
coefficient is just another way of saying its resistance to electrical current flow decreases as temperature
increases. The opposite is true of the conductor. It has a positive temperature coefficient. Because of this
particular characteristic, semiconductors are used extensively in power-measuring equipment.
