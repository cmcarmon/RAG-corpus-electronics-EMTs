The complete spectrum of communications frequencies is broken down into ranges or bands. The 
United States practice is to designate a two- or three-letter abbreviation for the name. The practice of the 
International Telecommunications Union (ITU) is to designate a number. Table 1-25 shows the bands and 
their designators. Table 1-26 indicates the frequency spectrum broken down as to usage.
