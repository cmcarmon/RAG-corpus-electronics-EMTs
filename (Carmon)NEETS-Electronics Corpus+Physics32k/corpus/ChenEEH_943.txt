Three computational algorithms for solving problem QP-3
are described in the following three sections. The ﬁrst two
algorithms—called LMCS-1 and LMCS-2,
respectively—
compute ^ll and ^ss in this order according to the dependence
relationship ^ss ¼ 1=2Bt ^ll described by equation 4.64. The
third algorithm—called CSD—computes the clock schedule ^ss
directly as described by equation 4.74. The algorithms LMCS-
1 and LMCS-2 are described in the following ﬁrst two subsec-
tions. The last two subsections describe algorithm CSD, which
is shown to be superior to both of the other algorithms, and
offer a comparative summary of the results.
