When a system of sources is so large that its voltage and frequency remain constant regardless
of the power delivered or absorbed, it is known as an inﬁnite bus. Such a bus has a voltage and
a frequency that are unaffected by external disturbances. The inﬁnite bus is treated as an ideal
voltage source.
