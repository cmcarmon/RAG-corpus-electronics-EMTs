Speciﬁcation:  A statement of the design or development requirements to be satisﬁed by a system or product.
Systems engineering:  An approach to the overall life cycle evolution of a product or system. Generally, the
systems engineering process comprises a number of phases. There are three essential phases in any systems
engineering  life  cycle:  formulation  of  requirements  and  speciﬁcations,  design  and  development  of  the
system  or  product,  and  deployment  of  the  system.  Each  of  these  three  basic  phases  may  be  further
expanded  into  a  larger  number.  For  example,  deployment  generally  comprises  operational  test  and
evaluation, maintenance over an extended operational life of the system, and modiﬁcation and retroﬁt
(or replacement) to meet new and evolving user needs.
