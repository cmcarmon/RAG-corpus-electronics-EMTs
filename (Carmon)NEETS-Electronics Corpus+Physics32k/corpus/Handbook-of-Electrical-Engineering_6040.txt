Interchange Transaction Scheduling
The contractual exchange of power between utilities has to be taken into account by the LFC and ED functions.
This is done by calculating the net interchange (sum of all the buy and sale agreements) and adding this to the
generation  needed  in  both  the  LFC  and  ED.  Since  most  interchanges  begin  and  end  on  the  hour,  the  net
interchange is ramped from one level to the new over a 10- or 20-min period straddling the hour. The programs
achieve this automatically from the list of scheduled transactions.
