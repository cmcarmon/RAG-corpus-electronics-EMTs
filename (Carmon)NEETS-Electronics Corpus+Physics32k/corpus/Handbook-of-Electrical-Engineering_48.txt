Rheostat. The rheostat is a current-setting device in which one terminal is connected to the resistive element
and the second terminal is connected to a movable contact to place a selected section of the resistive element
into  the  circuit.  Typically,  rheostats  are  wire-wound  resistors  used  as  speed  controls  for  motors,  ovens,  and
heater controls and in applications where adjustments on the voltage and current levels are required, such as
voltage dividers and bleeder circuits.
