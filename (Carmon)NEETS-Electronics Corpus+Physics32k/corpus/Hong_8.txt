When multiple components are connected in parallel, the voltage drop is the same 
across  all  components.  When  multiple  components  are  connected  in  series,  the  total 
voltage is the sum of the voltages across each component. These two statements can be 
generalized  as  Kirchoffâ€™s  Voltage  Law  (KVL),  which  states  that  the  sum  of  voltages 
around any closed loop (e.g. starting at one node, and ending at the same node) is zero, as 
shown in Figure 1.2.
