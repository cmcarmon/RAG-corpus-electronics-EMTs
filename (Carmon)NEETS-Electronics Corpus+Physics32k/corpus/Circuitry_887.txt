Fig. 19.36 shows these three thermal resistances 
together  with  the  temperatures  that  exist  at  each 
point in the arrangement shown in Fig. 19.35. The 
three  thermal  resistances  shown  in  Fig.  19.36 
actually appear ‘in series’ and we can use a simple 
electrical analogy to represent the thermal ‘circuit’ 
in electrical terms (see Fig. 19.37). 
  From  Fig.  19.37  we  can  conclude  that  the  total 
thermal resistance, (cid:4)T, is given by: 
 
(cid:4)T =(cid:4)JC + (cid:4)CS + (cid:4)SA 
(4) 
 
Note that the total thermal resistance is actually the 
same as the thermal resistance between the junction 
and ambient.
