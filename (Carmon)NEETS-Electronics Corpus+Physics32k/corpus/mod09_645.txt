During the next 100 microseconds, the capacitor discharges. The total circuit voltage is maintained at 
0 by the voltage across the resistor decreasing at exactly the same rate as the capacitor discharge. This 
exponential decrease in resistor voltage is shown during the second 100 microseconds of operation. The 
capacitor will now discharge 9.5 percent of its charge to a value of 8.6 volts. At the end of the second 100 
microseconds, the resistor voltage will rise in a positive direction to a value of âˆ’8.6 volts to maintain the 
total circuit voltage at 0 volts.
