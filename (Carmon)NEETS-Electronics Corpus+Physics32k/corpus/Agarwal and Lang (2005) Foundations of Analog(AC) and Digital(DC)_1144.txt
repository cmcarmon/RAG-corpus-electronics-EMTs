suppose the first stage is biased at VI A = 2.2 V to achieve a small-signal gain
magnitude of 12. Let us determine whether the output operating-point voltage
of the first stage can provide a valid input bias voltage for the second stage.
When the first stage is biased at VI A = 2.2 V, the first stage operating-point
output voltage VOA is given by Equation 8.24. Substituting the parameters for
our circuit, we have
