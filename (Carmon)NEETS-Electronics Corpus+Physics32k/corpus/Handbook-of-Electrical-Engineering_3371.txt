The waveguides can be fabricated by using either the Ti indiffusion method or the proton exchange method.
The  ﬁrst  step  in  fabricating  a  waveguide  device  using  Ti  indiffusion  is  the  patterning  in  titanium.  The  bare
LiNbO3 surface is ﬁrst cleaned and then coated with photoresist. Next, the coated substrate is exposed using
the  waveguide-layer  chrome  mask.  The  photoresist  is  then  developed.  The  areas  that  have  been  exposed  are
removed  in  the  development  cycle.  The  patterned  substrates  are  then  coated  with  titanium  in  a  vacuum
evaporator. The titanium covers the exposed regions of the substrate as well as the surface of the remaining
photoresist. The substrate is next soaked in a photoresist solvent. This causes all the residual photoresist (with
titanium on top) to be removed, leaving only the titanium that coated the bare regions of the substrate. This
process is known as lift-off. Finally, the substrate, which is now patterned with titanium, is placed in a diffusion
system. At  temperatures  above  1000(cid:176)C  the  titanium  diffuses  into  the  substrate,  slightly  raising  the  refractive
index  of  these  regions.  This  process  typically  takes  less  than  10  hours.  This  sequence  of  steps  is  depicted  in
Fig. 31.25. The proton exchange method is depicted in Fig. 31.26. Here a chrome masking layer is ﬁrst deposited
on the LiNbO3 substrate. It is patterned using photoresist and etching. Next, the substrate is submerged in hot
benzoic acid. Finally, the chrome mask is removed and the substrate is annealed. The regions that have been
exposed to the benzoic acid will have an increased refractive index and will guide light.
