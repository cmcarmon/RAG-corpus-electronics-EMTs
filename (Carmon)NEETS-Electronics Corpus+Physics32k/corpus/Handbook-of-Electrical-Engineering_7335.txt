Transmitting  equipment  for  radio  communications  frequently  uses  PLLs  to  obtain  frequency  modulation
(FM) or phase modulation (PM). A PLL is ﬁrst designed to generate a radio frequency signal. The modulation
signal (i.e., voice) is then applied to the loop. For FM the modulating signal is added to the output of the loop
ﬁlter. The PLL will maintain the center frequency of the VCO, while the modulation will vary the VCO frequency
about this center. The frequency response of the FM input will exhibit a high-pass response and is described
by the error function shown in Eq. (76.3). Phase modulation is obtained by adding the modulation signal to
the input of the loop ﬁlter. The modulation will then vary the phase of the VCO output signal. The frequency
response of the PM input will be a low-pass characteristic described by the closed-loop transfer function shown
in Eq. (76.2).
