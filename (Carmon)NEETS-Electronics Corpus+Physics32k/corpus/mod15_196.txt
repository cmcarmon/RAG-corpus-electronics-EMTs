Two conditions must exist for a control transformer (CT) to be on electrical zero. First, its rotor 
voltage must be minimum when electrical zero voltages (S2 = 52 volts; S1 and S3 = 26 volts) are applied 
to its stator. Second, turning the shaft of the CT slightly counterclockwise should produce a voltage 
across its rotor in phase with the rotor voltage of the CX or TX supplying excitation to its stator. To zero 
a CT (using 78 volts from its transmitter) by the voltmeter method, use the following procedure:
