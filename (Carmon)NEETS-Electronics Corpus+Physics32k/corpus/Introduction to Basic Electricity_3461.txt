various sizes of integrated circuits: small-scale	inte-
gration	(ssI) with up to 100 electrical components 
per chip (early 1960s), medium-scale	integration	
(MsI) with 100 to 3000 electrical components per chip 
(late 1960s), large-scale	integration	(LsI) with 3000 
to 100,000 electrical components per chip (mid-1970s), 
and very	large-scale	integration	(VLsI) with 
100,000 to 1,000,000 electrical components per chip 
(1980s). uLsI stands for ultra-large-scale	integra-
tion and provides no qualitative leap from VLSI but is 
reserved to emphasize chip complexity in marketing. 
Integrated circuit families are shown in Figure 34-3.
