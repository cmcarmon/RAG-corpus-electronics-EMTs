In most electrical circuits only the difference of potential between two points is of importance and
the absolute potentials of the points are of little concern. Very often it is convenient to use one standard
reference for all of the various potentials throughout a piece of equipment. For this reason, the potentials
at various points in a circuit are generally measured with respect to the metal chassis on which all parts of
the circuit are mounted. The chassis is considered to be at zero potential and all other potentials are either
positive or negative with respect to the chassis. When used as the reference point, the chassis is said to be
at GROUND POTENTIAL.
