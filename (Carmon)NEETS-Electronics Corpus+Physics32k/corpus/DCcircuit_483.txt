As a footnote, the unit of siemens is never expressed without the last letter ”s.” In other
words, there is no such thing as a unit of ”siemen” as there is in the case of the ”ohm” or
the ”mho.” The reason for this is the proper spelling of the respective scientists’ surnames.
The unit for electrical resistance was named after someone named ”Ohm,” whereas the unit
for electrical conductance was named after someone named ”Siemens,” therefore it would be
improper to ”singularize” the latter unit as its ﬁnal ”s” does not denote plurality.
