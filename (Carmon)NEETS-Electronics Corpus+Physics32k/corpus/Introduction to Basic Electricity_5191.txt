The best soldering techniques can be outlined 
simply. First, wipe the tip of the soldering iron on a 
damp sponge. Then place a small amount of solder on 
the tip and apply the tip to the connection to be sol-
dered. Solder should not be applied until the connec-
tion becomes hot enough to melt the solder. How long 
this takes is quickly learned by a few trials. When the 
solder has melted and flowed into a contoured fillet, 
remove the solder. Keep the tip of the soldering iron 
on the connection for a few seconds longer, and then 
remove it. Do not disturb the newly made connection 
until it has had time to solidify. A good solder connec-
tion will be bright and shiny (Figure 49-18).
