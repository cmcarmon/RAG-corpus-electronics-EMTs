A diode detector circuit is shown in view A of figure 2-28. The secondary of T1 and C1 form a tuned
circuit that is resonant at the intermediate frequency. Should an echo pulse of sufficient amplitude be
received, the voltage (ei) developed across the tuned circuit is an IF pulse. Its shape is indicated by the
dashed line in view B. Positive excursions of e
