The  telemetry  data  received  may  be  recorded  in  a  number  of  ways,  but  such  records  must  preserve  the
accuracy of the entire system. For example, if one is monitoring a 1% system and can distinguish 1/64th in.
on a paper graph, the minimum graph size for full scale should be approximately 2 in. Similarly, numeric data
should be printed to enough decimal places to preserve the accuracy of the system.
