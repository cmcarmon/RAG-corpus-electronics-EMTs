The relationship between circuit gain and bandwidth in an operational-amplifier circuit can be
expressed by the GAIN-BANDWIDTH PRODUCT (GAIN Â·  BANDWIDTH = UNITY GAIN POINT).
In other words, for operational-amplifier circuits, the gain times the bandwidth for one configuration of an
operational amplifier will equal the gain times the bandwidth for any other configuration of the same
operational amplifier. In other words, when the gain of an operational-amplifier circuit is changed (by
changing the value of feedback or input resistors), the bandwidth also changes. But the gain times the
bandwidth of the first configuration will equal the gain times the bandwidth of the second configuration.
The following example should help you to understand this concept.
