To analyze combination circuits, you apply voltage and current rules one 
step at a time, using series rules for components in series and parallel rules 
for components in parallel. At this point, you don’t quite have enough infor-
mation to calculate all the currents and voltages in the LED circuits shown 
here. You need to know about a rule called Ohm’s Law, which I explain in 
Chapter 6, and about how voltage is dropped across diodes, which I cover in 
Chapter 9. Then you’ll have everything you need to analyze simple circuits.
