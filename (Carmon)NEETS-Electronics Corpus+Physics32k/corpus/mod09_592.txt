The series RC and RL circuits electrically perform the mathematical operations of INTEGRATION 
and DIFFERENTIATION. Therefore, the circuits used to perform these operations are called 
INTEGRATORS and DIFFERENTIATORS. These names are applied to these circuits even though they 
do not always completely perform the operations of mathematical integration and differentiation.
