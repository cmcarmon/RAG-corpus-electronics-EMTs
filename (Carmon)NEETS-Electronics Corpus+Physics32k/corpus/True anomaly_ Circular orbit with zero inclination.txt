For circular orbits with zero inclination the argument of latitude is also undefined, because there is no uniquely determined line of nodes. One uses the true longitude instead:




l
=
arccos
⁡



r

x





|
r
|







{\displaystyle l=\arccos {r_{x} \over {\mathbf {\left|r\right|} }}}

(if vx > 0 then replace l by 2π − l)

where:
rx is the x-component of the orbital position vector r
vx is the x-component of the orbital velocity vector v.
