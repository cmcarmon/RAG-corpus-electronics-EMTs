The garage is an ideal setting because it gives you the freedom to work with 
solder and other messy materials without worrying about soiling the carpet 
or nearby furniture. You don’t need much space; about 3 by 4 feet ought to 
do it. If you can’t clear that much space in your garage (or you don’t have a 
garage), you can use a room in the house, but try to designate a corner or a 
section of the room for your electronics work. When working in a carpeted 
room, you can prevent static electricity by spreading a protective cover, 
such as an antistatic mat, over the floor. I discuss this in detail later in this 
chapter.
