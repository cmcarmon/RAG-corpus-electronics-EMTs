An energy wave generated by a transmitter is called a RADIO WAVE. The radio wave radiated into 
space by the transmitting antenna is a very complex form of energy containing both electric and magnetic 
fields. Because of this combination of fields, radio waves are also referred to as ELECTROMAGNETIC 
RADIATION.
