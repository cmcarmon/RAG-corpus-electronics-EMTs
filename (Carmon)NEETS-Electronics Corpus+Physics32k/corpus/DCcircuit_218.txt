SPICE cannot directly understand a schematic diagram or any other form of graphical
description. SPICE is a text-based computer program, and demands that a circuit be described
in terms of its constituent components and connection points. Each unique connection point
in a circuit is described for SPICE by a ”node” number. Points that are electrically common to
each other in the circuit to be simulated are designated as such by sharing the same number.
It might be helpful to think of these numbers as ”wire” numbers rather than ”node” numbers,
following the deﬁnition given in the previous section. This is how the computer knows what’s
connected to what: by the sharing of common wire, or node, numbers. In our example circuit,
we only have two ”nodes,” the top wire and the bottom wire. SPICE demands there be a node
0 somewhere in the circuit, so we’ll label our wires 0 and 1:
