Jeb asks his science teacher for help. The science teacher tells him, ‘‘Take
a resistor and an inductor and connect them in series. Then take the high
frequencies off one element and the low frequencies of the other,’’ and then
rushes off to teach a class. Unfortunately, Jeb forgot to ask which element
to connect to the low-frequency woofer and which to connect to the high-
frequency tweeter.
