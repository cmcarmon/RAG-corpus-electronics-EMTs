Ship-to-Ship.â€”Ship-to-ship ssb teletypewriter circuits are in wide use today. Their main application
is with task force or task group networks or with several ships in company. By using this type of network,
ships can send their outgoing messages to another ship that relays traffic ashore. You can see this
procedure saves manpower and circuit time, prevents individual ships from overcrowding ship-to-shore
circuits, and conserves the frequency spectrum. Depending on the number and types of ships in company,
the guard can be shifted to other ships from time to time. A major advantage of these circuits is that
electronic cryptographic devices can be used to send classified messages without need for manual
encryption. These circuits are used for incoming as well as outgoing traffic, and they can use either hf or
uhf communications equipment.
