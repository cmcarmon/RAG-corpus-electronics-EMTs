Similarly, the ammeter measures the current through the load and
is  connected  in  series  with  it. As  shown  in  Fig.  2.61(a),  the  ammeter
consists  of  a  d’Arsonval  movement  in  parallel  with  a  resistor  whose
resistance 
is  deliberately  made  very  small  (theoretically,  zero)  to
minimize  the  voltage  drop  across  it.  To  allow  multiple  ranges,  shunt
resistors  are  often  connected  in  parallel  with 
as  shown  in
Fig. 2.61(b).  The  shunt  resistors  allow  the  meter  to  measure  in  the
range 0–10 mA, 0–100 mA, or 0–1 A, depending on whether the switch
is connected to
