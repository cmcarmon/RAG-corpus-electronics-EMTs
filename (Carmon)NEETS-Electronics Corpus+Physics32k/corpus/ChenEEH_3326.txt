Electric Generators
To understand modeling generators for dynamic analysis, more
details on the physical construction are needed. Most gener-
ators are three-phase synchronous machines, which means they
are designed to operate at a constant frequency. The machine
rotor is driven mechanically by the prime mover governing
system to control power output and speed. Synchronous ma-
chine rotors can be classiﬁed as either cylindrical or salient
pole. Cylindrical rotors have an even air gap at all points
between the stator, i.e., the stationary part of the machine, and
the rotor. This construction is used for machines that rotate at
high speed, typically steam-driven generators. Steam generators
generally are two-pole or four-pole machines and so rotate, in
North America, at 1800 RPM or 3600 RPM to produce the
desired 60 Hz signal. Hydro generators, conversely, may have
numerous pole pairs, as it is more efﬁcient to drive them at
lower speeds. These generators have a salient pole construction
that leads to a variable air gap between the stator and the rotor.
For modeling purposes, the pole construction is important
because it represents the mechanical speed of rotations and
also because the transfer of power from the rotor to the stator
through mutual inductance depends on the size of the air gap
(i.e., the reluctance of the air gap and, thus, the effective
coupling). During disturbances, these variations are most evi-
dent, and the effective circuit inductances must be modeled
accurately. In modern power system modeling for dynamic
analysis, a rotating frame of reference is chosen to represent
these effects. The circuit equations are then written in terms of
direct and quadrature axes. For simplicity, the more involved
rotating frame of reference models are not developed here but
instead a simple model approximating the variable inductances
is presented. To begin, there are primarily two sets of windings
of concern:
