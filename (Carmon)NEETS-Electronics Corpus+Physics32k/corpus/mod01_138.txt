When two magnetic poles are brought close together, the mutual attraction or repulsion of the poles
produces a more complicated pattern than that of a single magnet. These magnetic lines of force can be
plotted by placing a compass at various points throughout the magnetic field, or they can be roughly
illustrated by the use of iron filings as before. A diagram of magnetic poles placed close together is shown
in figure 1-15.
