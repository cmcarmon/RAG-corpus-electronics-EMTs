Negative feedback has a profound effect on the Thévenin-equivalent input and
output resistances of circuits. To illustrate, we calculate first the Thévenin out-
put resistance of the simple inverting Op Amp assumed to be operating in the
active (non-saturated) region, that is, the circuit in Figure 15.8b. Obviously if
we model the Op Amp by the ideal Op Amp model, the Thévenin output resis-
tance is by definition zero, with or without feedback. So to show any effect, we
must use a more accurate device model that includes some finite resistance in
series with the dependent source, as in Figure 15.11. One way of calculating the
Thévenin output resistance is to apply a test current it, at the output terminals,
as shown in Figure 15.11, and calculate the resulting voltage vt, when all other
independent sources, in this case vi, are set to zero.
