where w0 is the angular speed (rad/s) of the rotor in a steady state. This equation can be modeled as a voltage
source â€“E F behind a reactance  jXs , as shown in Fig. 66.4; this reactance is usually referred to as synchronous
reactance. The resistor Ra in the diagram represents the winding resistance, and Vt is the voltage measured across
the winding.
