The generic expression of bipolar transistor is used for various
types of this device. The most important type is the vertical
npn bipolar transistor that is available as (a) silicon-based
homojunction version (npn-BJT) and (b) SiGe or III–V
material-based heterojunction version (HBT). Less often
employed versions are the lateral pnp (LPNP) and vertical
pnp (VPNP) transistor. In this chapter, emphasis is placed on
the npn-BJT for presenting a basic theory that can be applied
to the other transistor versions with few modiﬁcations.
