be  mesh  or  node  equations  in  terms  of  elemental  currents  and  voltages.  Box  6  of  Fig.  100.2  suggests  a
generalization  to  other  disciplines,  in  terms  of  continuity  and  compatibility  laws,  using  through  variables
(generalization of current that ï¬‚ows through an element) and across variables (generalization of voltage, which
has a differential value across an element) [Shearer
