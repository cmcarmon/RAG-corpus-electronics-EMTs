The phase velocity




c



{\displaystyle \scriptstyle c}
of a linear gravity wave with wavenumber




k



{\displaystyle \scriptstyle k}
is given by the formula




c
=



g
k



,


{\displaystyle c={\sqrt {\frac {g}{k}}},}

where g is the acceleration due to gravity. When surface tension is important, this is modified to




c
=




g
k


+



σ
k

ρ




,


{\displaystyle c={\sqrt {{\frac {g}{k}}+{\frac {\sigma k}{\rho }}}},}

where σ is the surface tension coefficient and ρ is the density.

Since




c
=
ω

/

k



{\displaystyle \scriptstyle c=\omega /k}
is the phase speed in terms of the angular frequency




ω



{\displaystyle \scriptstyle \omega }
and the wavenumber, the gravity wave angular frequency can be expressed as




ω
=


g
k


.


{\displaystyle \omega ={\sqrt {gk}}.}

The group velocity of a wave (that is, the speed at which a wave packet travels) is given by





c

g


=



d
ω


d
k



,


{\displaystyle c_{g}={\frac {d\omega }{dk}},}

and thus for a gravity wave,





c

g


=

g
k



=

c
.


{\displaystyle c_{g}={\frac {1}{2}}{\sqrt {\frac {g}{k}}}={\frac {1}{2}}c.}

The group velocity is one half the phase velocity. A wave in which the group and phase velocities differ is called dispersive.
