In the introduction above, quotation marks appear around
terms that are used in an unusual manner. The signal that is
being transformed into the frequency domain is, in fact, al-
ready in what we ordinarily consider the frequency domain.
Therefore the ‘‘new’’ frequency domain was dubbed the que-
frency domain by Tukey in the earlier work on the cepstrum,
and the cepstrum was so named because it plays the role of a
spectrum in the quefrency domain. The index of the cepstrum
(which actually represents DT) is called the quefrency axis.
The harmonic frequencies of Cs(v), which are actually time
indices of the cepstrum, are called rahmonics. There is an
entire vocabulary of amusing terms that accompanies cepstral
analysis [see the title of the paper by Bogert et al. (1996)], but
only the terms cepstrum and quefrency (and sometimes lifter-
ing, a concept discussed next, are widely used by speech pro-
cessing engineers.
