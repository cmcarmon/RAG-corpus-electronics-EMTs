Other parameters also include the maximum allowable lateral and angular errors as determined by the size of
the part and by its design. These errors must be large enough to compensate for errors due to parts, robots,
and Ô¨Åxturing. Passive and instrumented (IRCC) devices have been developed for assembly applications. One
such  device  that  combines  a  passive  compliance  with  active  control  is  described  by  Xu  and  Paul  [1992].  In
addition, the SCARA (Selective Compliance Articulated Robot for Assembly) class of robots is stiff vertically
but relatively compliant laterally.
