the
coupling, transmission, and resonance behavior of the micro-
optical structures in Figure 9.18 can be determined. This
permits effective engineering design. For example, Figure 9.19
shows visualizations of the FDTD-calculated sinusoidal steady-
state optical electric Ô¨Åeld distributions for a typical microdisk
in Figure 9.18. In the upper left panel, the optical excitation is
at a nonresonant frequency, 193.4 THz (an optical wavelength,
l, of 1:55 mm). Here, 99.98% of the rightward-directed power
in the incident signal remains in the lower waveguide. In the
