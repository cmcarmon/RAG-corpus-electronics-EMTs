. Therefore, the s-domain impedance for an inductor is  sL . For a resistor, the 
is 
s-domain impedance is still R. A summary of the s-domain representation of electronic 
circuits  is  shown  in  Table  3.1.  Interestingly,  the  s-domain  impedance  very  closely 
resembles  the  complex  impedances  discussed  previously.  In  fact,  the  s-domain 
impedance is an extended version of the complex impedance that generalizes to arbitrary 
signals.
