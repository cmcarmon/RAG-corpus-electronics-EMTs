A current flowing in a wire whose length is properly related to the rf produces an electro magnetic 
field. This field is radiated from the wire and is set free in space. We will discuss how these waves are set 
free later in this chapter. Remember, the principles of radiation of electromagnetic energy are based on 
two laws:
