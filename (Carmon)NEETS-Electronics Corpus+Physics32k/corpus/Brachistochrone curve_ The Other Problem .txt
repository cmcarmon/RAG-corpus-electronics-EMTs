The second problem proposed by Johann Bernoulli is: 'Given a fixed point P, a curve is sought, such that for each straight line PKL cutting it in 2 points K and L, the sum of the distances PK and PL, raised to a given power n, is a constant'. Although its only connection with the Brachistochrone problem is that it was posed at the same time, Newton’s solution is elegant and worth including, since it is not well known.
He defines an infinite line ADB not containing P, with a fixed point A and variable point D, having AD = x. The required curve is obtained from the quadratic expression in y:




y

+
Q
(
x
)
.
y
+
R
(
x
)
=
0


{\displaystyle y^{2}+Q(x).y+R(x)=0}
, where Q(x) and R(x) are continuous functions of x. Q(x) and R(x) are not independent, their particular dependence is determined by the value of n.
PDK is set equal to the smaller root, and PDL to the larger, whenever the 2 roots are real.
Since

{\displaystyle -Q(x)=PK+PL,R(x)=PK.PL}
, the sum of PK and PL both raised to any power, n can be obtained from polynomials in Q and R, which can be set to a constant.
For example,

{\displaystyle PK^{3}+PL^{3}=-(Q^{3}-3QR)}
, so if the latter is made a constant, then the condition is satisfied for n = 3.
Similarly, for n = 4,

{\displaystyle PK^{4}+PL^{4}=Q^{4}-4Q^{2}R+2R^{2}=constant}
and so on for any value of n.
Having solved the problem he goes on to consider the case where a curve is cut in 3 points, so that the sum of the distances raised to any power from a fixed point, P to each of them is constant.
His curve is now
