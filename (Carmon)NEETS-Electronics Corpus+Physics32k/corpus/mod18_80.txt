Mechanical elevation scanning is achieved by mechanically moving the antenna or radiation source.
Weapons-control and tracking radar systems commonly use mechanical elevation scanning techniques.
Most electronically scanned radar systems are used as air search radars. Some older air-search radar
systems use a mechanical elevation scanning device; however, these are being replaced by electronically
scanned radar systems.
