output.  This  error  information  is  fed  back  to  the  system  and  adjusts  the  system  parameters  in  a  systematic
fashion  (the  learning  rule).  The  process  is  repeated  until  the  performance  is  acceptable.  It  is  clear  from  this
description that the performance hinges heavily on the data. If one does not have data that cover a signiÔ¨Åcant
portion of the operating conditions or if they are noisy, then neural network technology is probably not the
right solution. On the other hand, if there is plenty of data and the problem is poorly understood to derive an
approximate model, then neural network technology is a good choice.
