Examination of these characteristics or attributes of lead network and lag network compensation suggests
that it might be possible to combine the two approaches to achieve the desirable features of each approach.
Thus we will attempt to provide attenuation below the crossover frequency to decrease the phase lag at crossover
and  phase  lead  closer  to  the  crossover  frequency  in  order  to  increase  the  phase  lead  of  the  uncompensated
system at the crossover frequency.
