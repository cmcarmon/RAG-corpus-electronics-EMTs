After connecting the yellow test lead to the emitter, the green test lead to the base, and the blue test
lead to the collector, plug the test probe (not shown) into the jack located at the lower right-hand corner of
the test set. When testing grounded equipment, unplug the 115 vac line cord and use battery operation.
The beta reading is attained by multiplying the meter reading times the RANGE switch setting. Refer to
the transistor characteristics book provided with the tester to determine if the reading is normal for the
type of transistor under test.
