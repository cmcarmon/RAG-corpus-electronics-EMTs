Traction motors also are used for braking, which generates power that can be reconditioned and returned
to the power system to power other vehicles or returned to the power grid. Power that cannot be returned or
used  elsewhere  in  the  system  is  converted  into  heat  by  banks  of  large  braking  resistors.  Electric  braking  is
supplemented  by  mechanical  braking  systems  which  can  be  actuated  pneumatically,  hydraulically,  and/or
electrically. Coordination of propulsion and braking efforts, especially when traction surfaces are slippery, is
an important design point.
