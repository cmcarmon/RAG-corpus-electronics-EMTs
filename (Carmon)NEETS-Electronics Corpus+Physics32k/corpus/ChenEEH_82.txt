The PF of an inductive load is lagging and that of a capaci-
tive load is leading. A pure inductor has zero-lagging power
factor and absorbs positive reactive power. A pure capacitor
has zero-leading power factor and absorbs negative reactive
power or delivers positive reactive power. Table 1.10 summar-
izes the expressions for various power quantities in ac circuit
elements. Loads are usually speciﬁed in terms of P and PF at a
rated voltage. Examples are motors and household appliances.
Alternatively, the apparent P and PF can be speciﬁed.
