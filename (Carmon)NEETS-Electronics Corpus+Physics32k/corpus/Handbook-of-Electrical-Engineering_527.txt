The  electrical  circuit  symbol  for  a  bipolar  diode  is  shown  in  Fig.  5.1.  The  polarities  associated  with  the
forward voltage drop for forward current ï¬‚ow are also included. Current or voltage opposite to the polarities
indicated in Fig. 5.1 are considered to be negative values with respect to the diode conventions shown.
