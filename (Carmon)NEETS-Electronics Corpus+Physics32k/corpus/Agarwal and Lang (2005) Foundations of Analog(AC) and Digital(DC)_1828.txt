(cid:1) To facilitate the analysis of second-order circuits, we also introduced two
new methods of circuit analysis, namely state-variable analysis and state-
space analysis. State-variable analysis was introduced as an alternative to
node analysis, which is particularly useful when the state variables of a
circuit, as opposed to the node voltages, are of primary interest. State-
space analysis was introduced as a means of solving the coupled first-order
differential equations that commonly result from a state-variable analysis.
However, we also saw that it could be used as a means of solving the
differential equations that naturally result from a node analysis. Finally, we
briefly examined the analysis of higher-order circuits. The important finding
from that examination was that the analysis of higher-order circuits can be
carried out in a manner identical to the analysis of second-order circuits.
