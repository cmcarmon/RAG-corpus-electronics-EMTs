Many commonly encountered excitations can be represented by exponential functions. The
differential equations describing the networks are transformed into algebraic equations with
the use of exponentials. So far, methods have been developed to determine the forced re-
sponse and the transient response in Sections 3.1 and 3.2. The operational calculus was de-
veloped by Oliver Heaviside (1850–1925) based on a collection of intuitive rules; the trans-
formation is, however, named after Pierre Simon Laplace (1749–1827) because a complete
mathematical development of Heaviside’s methods has been found in the 1780 writings of
Laplace. The Laplace transformation provides a systematic algebraic approach for determining
the total network response, including the effect of initial conditions. The differential equa-
tions in the time domain are transformed into algebraic equations in the frequency domain.
Frequency-domain quantities are manipulated to obtain the frequency-domain equivalent of the
desired result. Then, by taking the inverse transform, the desired result in the time domain
is obtained.
