Field strength: A general term that means the magnitude of the electric ﬁeld vector (in volts per meter) or
the magnitude of the magnetic ﬁeld vector (in ampere-turns per meter). As used in the ﬁeld of EMC/EMI,
the term ﬁeld strength shall be applied only to measurements made in the far ﬁeld and shall be abbreviated
as FS. For measurements made in the near ﬁeld, the term electric ﬁeld strength (EFS) or magnetic ﬁeld
strength (MFS) shall be used, according to whether the resultant electric or magnetic ﬁeld, respectively,
is measured.
