The classiﬁcation of the existing approaches can be based on
two main design properties: the type of the communication
media used and the type of the measurements compared. The
communication media most commonly used are metallic wire,
also known as pilot-wire; leased telephone lines; microwave
radio; and ﬁber-optic cables. The measurements typically used
for the scheme are composite values obtained by combining
several signal measurements at a given end (IEEE, 1999) and
sample-by-sample values of the phase currents (IEEE, 1999). A
summary of the most common approaches for the differential
relaying principle for transmission lines is given in Table 9.4.
