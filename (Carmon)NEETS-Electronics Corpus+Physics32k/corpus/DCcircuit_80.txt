Notice the little ”+” and ”-” signs to the immediate left of the battery symbol. The negative
(-) end of the battery is always the end with the shortest dash, and the positive (+) end of
the battery is always the end with the longest dash. Since we have decided to call electrons
”negatively” charged (thanks, Ben!), the negative end of a battery is that end which tries to
push electrons out of it. Likewise, the positive end is that end which tries to attract electrons.
With the ”+” and ”-” ends of the battery not connected to anything, there will be voltage
between those two points, but there will be no ﬂow of electrons through the battery, because
there is no continuous path for the electrons to move.
