Figure 38-3 shows another type of two-stage DC 
amplifier in which both an NPN transistor and a 
PNP transistor are used. This type of circuit is called 
a complementary amplifier. The circuit functions 
the same way as the circuit shown in Figure 38-2. The 
difference is that the second-stage transistor is a PNP 
transistor, which is reversed so that the emitter and 
collector are biased properly.
