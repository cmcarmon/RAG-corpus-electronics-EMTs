The graph in figure 1-5 shows the ripple effect of the voltage when two armature coils are used. 
Since there are now four commutator segments in the commutator and only two brushes, the voltage 
cannot fall any lower than at point A. Therefore, the ripple is limited to the rise and fall between points A 
and B on the graph. By adding more armature coils, the ripple effect can be further reduced. Decreasing 
ripple in this way increases the effective voltage of the output.
