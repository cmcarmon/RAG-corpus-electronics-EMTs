i.e.,  the  spectrum  contains  only  integer  multiples  of  the  fundamental  frequency wo.  Therefore,  the  equation
pair given by Eq. (14.5a) and (14.5b) can be interpreted as a transform pair that is similar to the CT Fourier
transform for periodic signals. This leads to the observation that the classical Fourier series can be interpreted
as a special transform that provides a one-to-one invertible mapping between the discrete-spectral domain and
the CT domain.
