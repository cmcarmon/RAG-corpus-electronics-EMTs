During one alternation of the secondary voltage, the polarities are as shown in view A. The source 
for D2 is the voltage induced into the lower half of the secondary winding of the transformer (W2). At the 
specific instant of time shown in the figure, the anode voltage on D2 is negative, and D2 cannot conduct. 
Throughout the period of time during which the anode of D2 is negative, the anode of D1 is positive. 
Since the anode of D1 is positive, it conducts, causing current to flow through the load resistor in the 
direction shown by the arrow.
