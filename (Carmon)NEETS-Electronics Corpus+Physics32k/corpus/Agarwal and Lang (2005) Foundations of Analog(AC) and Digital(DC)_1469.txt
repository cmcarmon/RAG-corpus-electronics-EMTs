This time around, since there is an initial condition on the capacitor, we are no
longer dealing with just the zero-state response, so we cannot simply take the
integral. One approach is to notice that Equation 10.124 is in effect the zero-
state response, so if we find the zero-input response corresponding to the initial
condition of Equation 10.125, then the complete solution is the sum of these
two responses. We know from previous examples, or from Equation 10.97,
that the ZIR for an RC circuit with an initial voltage V0 is
