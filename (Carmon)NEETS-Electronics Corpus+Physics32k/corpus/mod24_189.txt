Microbend losses are caused by small discontinuities or imperfections in the fiber. Uneven coating
applications and improper cabling procedures increase microbend loss. External forces are also a source
of microbends. An external force deforms the cabled jacket surrounding the fiber but causes only a small
bend in the fiber. Microbends change the path that propagating modes take, as shown in figure 2-23.
Microbend loss increases attenuation because low-order modes become coupled with high-order modes
that are naturally lossy.
