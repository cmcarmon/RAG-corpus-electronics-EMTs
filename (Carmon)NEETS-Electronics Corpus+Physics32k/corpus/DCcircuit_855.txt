Resistor symbols have been added to the wires of the cable to show what is happening in a
real system. Bear in mind that these resistances can be minimized with heavy-gauge wire (at
additional expense) and/or their effects mitigated through the use of a high-resistance (null-
balance?) voltmeter for an indicator (at additional complexity).
