Dual-mode ﬁlters (canonical symmetric design), as de-
scribed in Figure 7.38, are based on square or circular wave-
guide cavities that support two orthogonals in a single cavity
(Zaki et al., 1987). Thus, the ﬁlter structure can be miniatur-
ized, and elliptic function and linear phase performance can
also be obtained. Dual-mode ﬁlters can be based on low-loss
high-permittivity square or cylindrical dielectric blocks. The
idea is to maintain the electromagnetic ﬁeld inside the dielec-
tric material and away from the lossy metallic wall to improve
the Q factor. These design approaches are found in very
narrow band applications (less than 0.1%) at low frequencies
(Less than 3 GHz). Even smaller bandwidth is only obtainable
with superconductor ﬁlters. Depending on how much the
dielectric ﬁlls the metal cavity, the size reduction effect sets in.
Coax ﬁlters are found as combline and interdigital ﬁlters
and are mainly used in the lower microwave domain. Inter-
digital ﬁlters are based on side-to-side coupled l=4 resonators,
whereas the combline ﬁlters (Figure 7.38) consist of coupled
resonators that are loaded with lumped capacitors at the open
ends to reduce the lengths of the resonators and thus help to
shrink the complete ﬁlter volume. Dielectric waveguide ﬁlters
use high Q dielectric resonator building blocks, and the input
and output lines are usually in the form of waveguide or
coaxial
lines. The dielectric resonators are canonical with
high dielectric constants, and they are coupled with each
other through irises or adjacent air interfaces. Generally, the
dielectric band-pass ﬁlters can be used over the frequency
range from 300 MHz to 100 GHz. For high-frequency applica-
tions, NRD waveguide ﬁlters (Figure 7.38) gain interests be-
cause of the extremely low-loss and low dielectric constant
materials that can be used in the design.
