The same concept can be generalized to add a long sequence of num-
bers. At any given instant, the memory stores the partial result corresponding
to all the numbers that occurred till that instant. For our addition example,
notice that future results depend only on the value stored in memory and future
inputs. Future results do not depend on the exactly how the memory was time
sequenced, just its final state. This observation stems from the concept of a
‘‘state variable’’ that we saw earlier. The value stored in memory is simply a
digital state variable in a manner analogous to an analog state variable value
stored on a capacitor.
