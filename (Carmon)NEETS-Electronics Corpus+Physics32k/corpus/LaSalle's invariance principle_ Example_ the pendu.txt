This section will apply the invariance principle to establish the local asymptotic stability of a simple system, the pendulum with friction. This system can be modeled with the differential equation [1]

{\displaystyle ml{\ddot {\theta }}=-mg\sin \theta -kl{\dot {\theta }}}

where



θ


{\displaystyle \theta }
is the angle the pendulum makes with the vertical normal,



m


{\displaystyle m}
is the mass of the pendulum,



l


{\displaystyle l}
is the length of the pendulum,



k


{\displaystyle k}
is the friction coefficient, and g is acceleration due to gravity.
This, in turn, can be written as the system of equations

Using the invariance principle, it can be shown that all trajectories which begin in a ball of certain size around the origin




x

{\displaystyle x_{1}=x_{2}=0}
asymptotically converge to the origin. We define



V

{\displaystyle V(x_{1},x_{2})}
as

{\displaystyle V(x_{1},x_{2})={\frac {g}{l}}(1-\cos x_{1})+{\frac {1}{2}}x_{2}^{2}}

This



V
(

x

,

x

)


{\displaystyle V(x_{1},x_{2})}
is simply the scaled energy of the system [2] Clearly,



V
(

x

x

)


{\displaystyle V(x_{1},x_{2})}
is positive definite in an open ball of radius

{\displaystyle \pi }
around the origin. Computing the derivative,

Observe that



V

(

=

{\displaystyle V(0)={\dot {V}}(0)=0}
. If it were true that






V

<

{\displaystyle {\dot {V}}<0}
, we could conclude that every trajectory approaches the origin by Lyapunov's second theorem. Unfortunately,






V

≤
0


{\displaystyle {\dot {V}}\leq 0}
and






V
˙





{\displaystyle {\dot {V}}}
is only negative semidefinite. However, the set

V

(

x

x

{\displaystyle S=\{(x_{1},x_{2})|{\dot {V}}(x_{1},x_{2})=0\}}

which is simply the set




S

{

x

)

|


x

}


{\displaystyle S=\{(x_{1},x_{2})|x_{2}=0\}}

does not contain any trajectory of the system, except the trivial trajectory x = 0. Indeed, if at some time



t


{\displaystyle t}
,




x

2


(
t
)
=
0


{\displaystyle x_{2}(t)=0}
, then because




x

1




{\displaystyle x_{1}}
must be less than



π


{\displaystyle \pi }
away from the origin,



sin

x

≠
0


{\displaystyle \sin x_{1}\neq 0}
and







x
˙




2


(
t
)
≠
0


{\displaystyle {\dot {x}}_{2}(t)\neq 0}
. As a result, the trajectory will not stay in the set



S


{\displaystyle S}
.
All the conditions of the local version of the invariance principle are satisfied, and we can conclude that every trajectory that begins in some neighborhood of the origin will converge to the origin as



t
→
∞


{\displaystyle t\rightarrow \infty }
