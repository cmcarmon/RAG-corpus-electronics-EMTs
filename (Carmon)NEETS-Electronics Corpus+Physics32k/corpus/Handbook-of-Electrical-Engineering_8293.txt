Data Compaction with Linear Cellular Automata Registers
LCARs  are  one-dimensional  arrays  composed  of  two  types  of  cells:  rule  150  and  rule  90  cells  [Cattell  et al.,
1996]. Each cell is composed of a ﬂip-ﬂop that saves the current state of the cell and an EXOR gate used to
compute the next state of the cell. A rule 150 cell computes its next state as the EXOR of its present state and
of the states of its two (left and right) neighbors. A rule 90 cell computes its next state as the EXOR of the states
of its two neighbors only. As can be seen in Fig. 85.8, all connections in an LCAR are near-neighbor connections,
thus saving routing area and delays (common for long LFSRs).
