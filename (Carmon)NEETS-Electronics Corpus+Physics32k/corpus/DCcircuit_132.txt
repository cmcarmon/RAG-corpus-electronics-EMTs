These units and symbols for electrical quantities will become very important to know as
we begin to explore the relationships between them in circuits. The ﬁrst, and perhaps most
important, relationship between current, voltage, and resistance is called Ohm’s Law, discov-
ered by Georg Simon Ohm and published in his 1827 paper, The Galvanic Circuit Investigated
Mathematically. Ohm’s principal discovery was that the amount of electric current through a
metal conductor in a circuit is directly proportional to the voltage impressed across it, for any
given temperature. Ohm expressed his discovery in the form of a simple equation, describing
how voltage, current, and resistance interrelate:
