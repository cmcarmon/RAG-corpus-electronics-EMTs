It is easy to see that the magnitude of the system function at low frequen-
cies is close to unity. At high frequencies, on the other hand, the magnitude
of the system function approaches 0. Because low frequencies are passed and
high frequencies are rejected or attenuated, this circuit acts as a low pass filter.
Figure 13.32 plots the frequency response of the RC circuit assuming that
the RC time constant of the circuit is RC = 1 / 20 seconds. The shape of the
