The  microprocessor  central  processing  unit 
(CPU) forms  the  heart  of  any  microprocessor  or 
microcomputer 
and, 
consequently,  its  operation  is  crucial  to  the  entire 
system.  
  The  primary  function  of  the  microprocessor  is 
that  of 
executing 
instructions  resident  in  memory.  As  such,  it  must 
be able to transfer data from external memory into 
registers  and  vice  versa.

accompanying  addresses  of  read/write  memory 
locations. In addition, various system housekeeping 
tasks need to be performed including being able to 
suspend  normal  processing  in  order  to  respond  to 
an external device that needs attention.
