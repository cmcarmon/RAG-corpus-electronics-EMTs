You can test a feedthrough termination by measuring the resistance between the center conductor
and the shield of either rf connector with an ohmmeter. As mentioned above, some terminations are
manufactured as loading devices that are designed to shunt an rf signal to ground. A perfectly matched
termination can be compared to a transmitting antenna in that it absorbs all of the rf signal with only a
