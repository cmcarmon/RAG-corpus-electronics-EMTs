where E T and HT are the magnitudes of the transverse electric and magnetic ﬁelds, respectively. In the limit as
f  ﬁ  ¥, both ZT E and ZTM approach 
, which is the intrinsic impedance of the dielectric medium. On the
other hand, as  f ﬁ  fc, ZTE ﬁ  ¥ and ZTM ﬁ  0, which means that the transverse electric ﬁelds are dominant in
TE modes near cut-off and vice versa for TM modes.
