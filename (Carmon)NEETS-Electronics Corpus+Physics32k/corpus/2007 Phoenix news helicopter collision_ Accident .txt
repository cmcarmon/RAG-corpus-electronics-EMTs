KNXV was the area's ABC affiliate, while KTVK was an independent news station, formerly an ABC affiliate itself. The KNXV helicopter was broadcasting a police pursuit live when the collision occurred, at 12:46 p.m. MST. Both aircraft came down in the Steele Indian School Park, central Phoenix.
Three other news helicopters from other stations (KSAZ, KPNX and KPHO) were in the area and within seconds began reporting on the crash. A photograph taken moments after the collision and showing both helicopters plunging towards the ground was circulated by AP.
