Most sequential blocks are of the kind known as multivibrators, which can be monostable
(the switch remains in only one of its two positions), bistable (the switch will remain stable in
either of its two positions), and unstable (the switch changes its position continuously as a kind
of oscillator, being unstable in both of its two states). The most common sequential block is the
ﬂip-ﬂop, which is a bistable circuit that remembers a single binary digit according to instructions.
Flip-ﬂops are the basic sequential building blocks. Various types of ﬂip-ﬂops exist, such as the
SR ﬂip-ﬂop (SRFF), D ﬂip-ﬂop (or latch), and JK ﬂip-ﬂop (JKFF), which differ from one another
in the way instructions for storing information are applied.
