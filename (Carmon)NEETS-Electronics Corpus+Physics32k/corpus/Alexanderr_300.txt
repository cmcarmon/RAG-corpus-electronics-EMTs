inductance  is  independent  of  current.  Such  an  inductor  is  known  as  a
linear  inductor.  For  a  nonlinear  inductor,  the  plot  of  Eq.  (6.18)  will
not  be  a  straight  line  because  its  inductance  varies  with  current.  We
will assume linear inductors in this textbook unless stated otherwise.
