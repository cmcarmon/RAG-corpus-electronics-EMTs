Similarly, the rotor windings of the resolver are wound at right angles to each other. Hence, there is
no magnetic coupling between the two windings. The rotor windings are mounted on the rotor shaft and
turn with it. The rotor is capable of unlimited rotation. Thus, the rotor windings can be set at any angle
with respect to the stator windings.
