The ounce (abbreviated oz; apothecary symbol: ℥) is a unit of mass used in most British derived customary systems of measurement. The common avoirdupois ounce (approximately 28.3 g) is ​1⁄16 of a common avoirdupois pound; this is the United States customary and British imperial ounce. It is primarily used in the United States to measure packaged foods and food portions, postal items, areal density of fabric and paper, boxing gloves, and so on; but sometimes also elsewhere in the Anglosphere.
Besides the common ounce, several other ounces are in current use:
The troy ounce of about 31.1 g is now only commonly used for the mass of precious metals such as gold, silver, platinum, palladium, rhodium, etc.
The ounce-force is a measure of weight, that is, force.
The fluid ounce is a measure of volume.
Historically, a variety of different ounces measuring mass or volume were used in different jurisdictions by different trades.
