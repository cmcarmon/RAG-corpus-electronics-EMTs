γ

{\displaystyle \gamma \left(\omega \right)}
is a factor that varies with frequency from one to three. At high frequencies, on the order of the plasma frequency, the compression of the electron fluid is an adiabatic process and



γ

{\displaystyle \gamma \left(\omega \right)}
is equal to three. At low frequencies, the compression is an isothermal process and



γ

{\displaystyle \gamma \left(\omega \right)}
is equal to one. Retardation effects have been neglected in obtaining the plasma-wave dispersion relation.
For low frequencies, the dispersion relation becomes

which does indeed yield the guessed propagator. This propagator is the same as the massive Coulomb propagator with the mass equal to the inverse Debye length. The interaction energy is therefore

The Coulomb potential is screened on length scales of a Debye length.
