ABET EC 2000 criteria (3.c), “an ability to design a system,
component, or process to meet desired needs.”
The  “ability  to  design  a  system,  component,  or  process  to  meet
desired  needs”  is  why  engineers  are  hired.  That  is  why  this  is  the
most important technical skill that an engineer has. Interestingly, your
success as an engineer is directly proportional to your ability to com-
municate  but  your  being  able  to  design  is  why  you  will  be  hired  in
the ﬁrst place.
