Static discipline The static discipline is a specification for digital devices. The
static discipline requires devices to interpret correctly voltages that fall within
the input thresholds (VIL and VIH). As long as valid inputs are provided to the
devices, the discipline also requires the devices to produce valid output voltages
that satisfy the output thresholds (VOL and VOH).
