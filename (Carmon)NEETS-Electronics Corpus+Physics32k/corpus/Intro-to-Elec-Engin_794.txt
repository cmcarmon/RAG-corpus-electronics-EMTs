The usage of a p-channel MOSFET as the active load for an n-channel MOSFET leads
to a logic family known as complementary-symmetry MOS, or CMOS. CMOS technology has
signiﬁcant advantages and has become most popular. A basic CMOS inverter is shown in Figure
9.3.2(a), in which both a p-channel and an n-channel enhancement MOSFET are used as a
symmetrical pair, with each acting as load for the other.
When the input vin is low, the gate–source voltage of the NMOS is less than the threshold
voltage and is cut off. The gate–source voltage of the PMOS, on the other hand, is −VSS, where
∼= VSS), the PMOS turns
VSS, the supply voltage, is greater than the threshold voltage, VT . Then the PMOS is on, and the
supply voltage appears at the output vout. When the input vin is high (vin
off; the NMOS turns on. Then VSS appears across the drain–source terminals of the PMOS and
the output vout drops to zero. Thus, the circuit functions as an inverter. Figure 9.3.2(b) shows the
simpliﬁed circuit model of the CMOS inverter by depicting each transistor as either a short or an
open circuit, depending on its state.
