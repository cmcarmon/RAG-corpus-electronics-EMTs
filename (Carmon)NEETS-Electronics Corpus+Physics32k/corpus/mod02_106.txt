 When an LR circuit is deenergized, the circuit current decreases (decays) to zero in five time 
constants at the same rate that it previously increased. If the growth and decay of current in an LR circuit 
are plotted on a graph, the curve appears as shown in figure 2-11. Notice that current increases and decays 
at the same rate in five time constants.
