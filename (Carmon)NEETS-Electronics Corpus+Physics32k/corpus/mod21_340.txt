In the electrical transmission of speech or music, rapidly fluctuating amplitudes and frequencies are 
involved. The average power-level measurement and its variation rate depend on the signal characteristics 
and time interval over which this average is taken. Power measurements for af circuits are usually 
indicated in terms of decibels (dB), decibels referenced to 1 milliwatt (dBm), or volume units (vu). For 
example, the power gain of an amplifier can be expressed in dB; the power level of a sinusoidal signal 
compared to a 1-milliwatt reference is indicated in dBm; and the power level of a complex signal, such as 
voice, music, or multiplexed information, compared to a reference level of 1 milliwatt, is indicated in vu.
