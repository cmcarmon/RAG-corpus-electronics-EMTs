Consider an elementary two-pole rotating machine with a uniform (or smooth) air gap, as shown
in Figure E12.4.1, in which the cylindrical rotor is mounted within the stator consisting of a hollow
cylinder coaxial with the rotor. The stator and rotor windings are distributed over a number of slots
so that their mmf can be approximated by space sinusoids. As a consequence of a construction of
this type, we can fairly assume that the self-inductances Lss and Lrr are constant, but the mutual
inductance Lsr is given by
