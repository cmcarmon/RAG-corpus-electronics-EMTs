The  control  unit  is  responsible  for  organizing  the 
orderly  flow  of  data  within  the  microprocessor  as 
well  as  generating,  and  responding  to,  signals  on 
the control bus. The control unit is also responsible 
for the timing of all data transfers. This process is 
synchronized  using  an  internal  or  external  clock 
signal (not shown in Fig. 11.3).
