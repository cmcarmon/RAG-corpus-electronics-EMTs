using an ‘alternative’ technique, a frame should be 
constructed  along  the  lines  shown  in  Figure  19.4. 
This can be used to hold the transparency in contact 
with  the  coated  copper  board  during  the  exposure 
process. 
  Whichever  method  of  exposure  is  used  some 
experimentation  may  be  required  in  order  to 
determine  the  optimum  exposure  time.  After  this 
time has elapsed, the board should be removed and 
immersed  in  a  solution  of  sodium  hydroxide  that 
acts as a developer. The solution should be freshly 
made  and  the  normal  concentration  required  is 
obtained  by  mixing  approximately  500  ml  of  tap 
water  (at  20°C)  with  one  tablespoon  of  sodium 
hydroxide crystals. A photographic developing tray 
(or  similar  shallow  plastic  container)  should  be 
used to hold the developer. Note that care should be 
taken when handling the developer solution and the 
use  of  plastic  or  rubber  gloves 
is  strongly 
recommended.  This  process  should  be  carried  out 
immediately  after  exposure  and  care  should  be 
taken not to allow the board to be further exposed 
under room lights. 
  The  board  should  be  gently  agitated  while 
immersed in the developer and the ensuing process 
of  development  should  be  carefully  watched.  The 
board  should  be  left  for  a  sufficiently  long  period 
for the entire surface to be developed correctly but 
not so long that the tracks lift. Development times 
will  depend  upon 
and 
concentration of the developer and on the age of the 
sensitized board. Normal development times are in
