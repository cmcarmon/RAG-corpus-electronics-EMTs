In Permanence, Schroeder envisions a vehicle that would never slow down, instead using Lorentz force turning to curve its trajectory in a circle, an idea considered by P.C. Norem in a 1969 paper. The idea is that the life support for an interstellar vehicle wouldn't have to be accelerated, only the payload, allowing more to be carried for a given energy budget.
