like MEMS pressure sensors, have
been on the market for several years, with well over 10 million
sold annually. The Ô¨Årst market for MEMS accelerometers was
the automobile industry for air bag triggers. Initially, single
axis devices were offered, and then two axis components
became available. The next big application for the two-dimen-
sional micro-accelerometers was in personal entertainment
systems to detect the motion of joy sticks. Packaging of micro-
accelerometers started with transistor cans. Next came surface
mount packages, and leadless devices are now available. Figure

plus or minus twice-normal gravity and a micrograph of the
chip. The integration of the single moving element and its
associated electronics in and on the silicon substrate is note-
