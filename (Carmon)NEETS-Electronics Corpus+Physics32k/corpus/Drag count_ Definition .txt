{\displaystyle \Delta C_{\mathrm {d} }\,}

{\displaystyle \Delta C_{\mathrm {d} }=10^{4}{\dfrac {2F_{\mathrm {d} }}{\rho v^{2}A}}\,,}

where:





F


d






{\displaystyle F_{\mathrm {d} }\,}
is the drag force, which is by definition the force component in the direction of the flow velocity,




ρ



{\displaystyle \rho \,}
is the mass density of the fluid,




v



{\displaystyle v\,}
is the speed of the object relative to the fluid and




A



{\displaystyle A\,}
is the reference area.
The drag coefficient is used to compare the solutions of different geometries by means of a dimensionless number. A drag count is used as a more user-friendly measurement as the coefficient of drag is usually much less than 1. A drag count of 200 to 400 is typical for an airplane at cruise. A reduction of one drag count on a subsonic civil transport airplane means about 200 lbs more in payload.
