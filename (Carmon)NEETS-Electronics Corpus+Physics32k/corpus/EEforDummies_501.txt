The wire that makes up an inductor is often insulated to prevent unintended 
short circuits between the turns. Inductors may also be shielded, or encased 
in a nonferrous metal can (typically brass or aluminum), to prevent the mag-
netic lines of flux from infiltrating the neighborhood of other components in 
a circuit. You use a shielded inductor when you don’t want to induce volt-
ages or currents in other circuit elements. You use an unshielded inductor 
(or coil) when you do want to affect other circuit elements. I discuss the use 
of unshielded coils in circuits in the later section “Influencing the Coil Next 
Door: Transformers.”
