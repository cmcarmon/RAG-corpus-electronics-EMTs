There are two principal ways in which electromagnetic (radio) energy travels from a transmitting 
antenna to a receiving antenna. One way is by GROUND WAVES and the other is by SKY WAVES. 
Ground waves are radio waves that travel near the surface of the Earth (surface and space waves). Sky 
waves are radio waves that are reflected back to Earth from the ionosphere. (See figure 2-11.)
