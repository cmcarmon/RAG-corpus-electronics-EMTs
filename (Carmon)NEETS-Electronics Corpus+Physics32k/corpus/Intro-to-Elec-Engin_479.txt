Digital computers and other large digital systems use mostly LSI and MSI chips. The number
of components per chip has increased from about 100 in the 1960s to 108 in the 1990s. Speed,
power consumption, and the number of gates (switches) on the chip are three of the more important
characteristics by which digital ICs are compared.
