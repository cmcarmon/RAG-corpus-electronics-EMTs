When the switch is ﬁrst closed, the voltage across the inductor will immediately jump to
battery voltage (acting as though it were an open-circuit) and decay down to zero over time
(eventually acting as though it were a short-circuit). Voltage across the inductor is determined
by calculating how much voltage is being dropped across R, given the current through the
inductor, and subtracting that voltage value from the battery to see what’s left. When the
switch is ﬁrst closed, the current is zero, then it increases over time until it is equal to the
battery voltage divided by the series resistance of 1 Ω. This behavior is precisely opposite
that of the series resistor-capacitor circuit, where current started at a maximum and capacitor
voltage at zero. Let’s see how this works using real values:
