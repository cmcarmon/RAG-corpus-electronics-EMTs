Phasors, being complex numbers, can be represented in the complex plane in the conventional
polar form as an arrow, having a length corresponding to the magnitude of the phasor, and an angle
(with respect to the positive real axis) that is the phase of the phasor. In a phasor diagram, the
various phasor quantities corresponding to a given network may be combined in such a way that
one or both of Kirchhoff’s laws are satisﬁed. In general the phasor method of analyzing circuits
is credited to Charles Proteus Steinmetz (1865–1923), a well-known electrical engineer with the
General Electric Company in the early part of the 20th century.
