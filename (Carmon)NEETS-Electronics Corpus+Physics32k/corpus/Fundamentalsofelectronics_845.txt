How small should the error probability be? Out of N transmitted bits, on the average N pe bits will be
received in error. Do note the phrase “on the average” here: Errors occur randomly because of the noise
introduced by the channel, and we can only predict the probability of occurrence. Since bits are transmitted
at a rate R, errors occur at an average frequency of Rpe. Suppose the error probability is an impressively
small number like 10−6. Data on a computer network like Ethernet is transmitted at a rate R = 100Mbps,
which means that errors would occur at a rate of roughly 100 per second. This error rate is very high,
requiring a much smaller pe to achieve a more acceptable average occurrence rate for errors occurring.
Because Ethernet is a wireline channel, which means the channel noise is small and the attenuation low,
obtaining very small error probabilities is not diﬃcult. We do have some tricks up our sleeves, however, that
can essentially reduce the error rate to zero without resorting to expending a large amount of energy at
the transmitter. We need to understand digital channels and what implications Shannon’s Noisy Channel
Coding Theorem has for them.

Let’s review how digital communication systems work within the Fundamental Model of Communication
(Figure 1.3). As depicted in Figure 6.17, the message is a single bit. The analog components of a digital
transmission/reception system can be lumped into a single system known as the digital channel.
