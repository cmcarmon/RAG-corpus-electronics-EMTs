It  is  well-known  that  a  low-pass  equivalent  model  can  be  developed  for  every  bandpass  system  [1].  As  a
result, the carrier frequency can be removed from the model of an RF communications system and the sampling
frequency is then determined solely by the bandwidth of the RF signal. This reduces signiÔ¨Åcantly the compu-
tational  effort  required  to  characterize  the  performance  of  a  chaotic  communications  system.  This  section
illustrates the development of a low-pass equivalent model for the RF FM-DCSK system. For further details
and models of other chaotic communications systems, see [9].
