â€¢ Sampled-data and digital control systems. These differ from the continuous-data systems
in that the signals at one or more points of the system are in the form of either a pulse
train or a digital code. Sampled-data systems usually refer to a more general class of
systems whose signals are in the form of pulse data, whereas a digital control system
refers to the use of a digital computer or controller in the system. The term discrete-data
control system is used to describe both types of systems.
