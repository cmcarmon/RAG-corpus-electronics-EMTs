Regardless of whether s[n] is a ﬁnite-length or a periodic sequence, the DFT treats the N samples of s[n] as
though they characterize one period of a periodic sequence. This is an important feature of the DFT, and one
that must be handled properly in signal processing to prevent the introduction of artifacts. Important properties
of the DFT are summarized in Table 14.5. The notation (k)N denotes k modulo N, and RN[n] is a rectangular
window such that RN[n] = 1 for n = 0, …, N – 1, and RN[n] = 0 for n < 0 and n ‡ N. The transform relationship
given by Eqs. (14.17a) and (14.17b) is also valid when s[n] and S[k] are periodic sequences, each of period N.
In this case, n and k are permitted to range over the complete set of real integers, and S[k] is referred to as the
discrete Fourier series (DFS). The DFS is developed by some authors as a distinct transform pair in its own
right [Oppenheim and Schafer, 1975]. Whether or not the DFT and the DFS are considered identical or distinct
is not very important in this discussion. The important point to be emphasized here is that the DFT treats s[n]
as  though  it  were  a  single  period  of  a  periodic  sequence,  and  all  signal  processing  done  with  the  DFT  will
inherit the consequences of this assumed periodicity.
