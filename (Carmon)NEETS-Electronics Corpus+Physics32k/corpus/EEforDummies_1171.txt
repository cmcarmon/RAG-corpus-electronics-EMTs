If you’re not sure which end is up in a diode you’ve got on hand, you can use 
your multimeter to identify the anode and the cathode. Run resistance tests 
with leads connected one way, and then with the leads connected the other 
way. For the lower of the two resistance readings, the red lead is connected 
to the anode and the black lead is connected to the cathode.
