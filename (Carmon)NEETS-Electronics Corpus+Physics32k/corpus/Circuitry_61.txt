 A very simple circuit diagram (a simple resistance 
tester) is shown in Fig. 1.20. This circuit may be a 
little  daunting  if  you  haven’t  met  a  circuit  like  it 
before  but  you  can  still  glean  a  great  deal  of 
information  from  the  diagram  even  if  you  don’t 
know what the individual components do. 
  The circuit uses two batteries, B1 (a 9 V multi-
cell  battery)  and  B2  (a  1.5  V  single-cell  battery).     
The  two  batteries  are  selected  by  means  of  a 
double-pole,  double-throw  (DPDT)  switch.  This 
allows  the  circuit  to  operate  from  either  the  9  V 
battery  (B1)  as  shown  in  Fig.  1.20(a)  or  from  the  
1.5  V  battery  (B2)  as  shown  in  Fig.  1.20(b) 
depending on the setting of S1.  
  A variable  resistor,  VR1,  is  used  to  adjust  the 
current supplied by whichever of the two batteries 
is  currently  selected.  This  current  flows  first 
through  VR1,  then  through  the  milliammeter,  and 
finally  through  the  unknown  resistor,  RX. Notice 
how the meter terminals are labelled showing their 
polarity (the current flows into the positive terminal 
and out of the negative terminal). 
  The circuit shown in Fig. 1.20(c) uses a different 
type  of  switch  but  provides  exactly  the  same 
function. In this circuit a single-pole, double-throw 
(SPDT) switch is used and the negative connections 
to the two batteries are ‘commoned’ (i.e. connected 
directly together).  
  Finally,  Fig.  1.20(d)  shows  how  the  circuit  can 
be  re-drawn  using  a  common  ‘chassis’  connection 
to provide the negative connection between RX and 
the 
is 
identical to the one shown in Fig. 1.20(c).
