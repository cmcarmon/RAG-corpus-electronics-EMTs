Any one of many statistical types or colors of noise, such as
White noise, which has constant power spectral density
Gaussian noise, with a probability density function equal to that of the normal distribution
Pink noise, with spectral density inversely proportional to frequency
Brownian noise or "brown" noise, with spectral density inversely proportional to the square of frequency

Pseudorandom noise, in cryptography, artificial signal that can pass for random
Statistical noise, a colloquialism for recognized amounts of unexplained variation in a sample
Noise-based logic, where logic values are different stochastic processes
Noise print, a statistical signature of ambient noise, used in its suppression
