In  welding,  a  worker  can  compensate  automatically  by  varying  welding  parameters  such  as  travel  speed,
deposition rate by current adjustment, weave patterns, and multiple welds where required. Duplicating human
welding  ability  and  skill  requires  that  industrial  robots  have  sensor  capability  and  complex  programming
capability. A  wide  variety  of  sensors  for  robotic  arc  welding  are  commercially  available  and  are  designed  to
track the welding seam and provide feedback information for the purpose of guiding the welding path.
