As a simple exercise, let us determine the greatest fanout degree that will
support a clock frequency of 333 MHz. Let us suppose the clock signal is driven
by an inverter as shown in Figure 10.45. Let us characterize the clock driver
inverter by RL = 1 k, RON = 100 , and CGS = 100 fF. Let us also assume
that we desire a symmetric clock. Thus the clock period T must be greater than
twice the greater of the rise and fall times at the output of the inverter. Since the
load resistance RL is much bigger than the ON resistance of the MOSFET, the
