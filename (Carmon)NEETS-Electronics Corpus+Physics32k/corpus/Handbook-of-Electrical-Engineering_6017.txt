Problems  concerning  effects  of  local  saturation,  anisotropic  magnetic  properties,  and  eddy-currents  in
machines require detailed modeling of the ﬁeld region. Two- and three-dimensional models of the ﬁeld region
can be solved using ﬁnite-element [Salon, 1995] and boundary-element [Shen, 1995] techniques. Although the
ﬁeld models are not as amenable as the circuit models for use in large system studies, they have been successfully
integrated  with  lumped  circuit  element  models  in  dynamic  simulations  [Demerdash  and  Alhamadi,  1995;
Preston et al., 1988].
