16. Recall that the notation u0(t) represents an impulse at time t . The notation un(t) represents
the function that results from differentiating the impulse times, and the notation u−n(t) represents
the function that results from integrating the impulse times. Thus u−1(t) represents the unit step
at time t, u−2(t) the ramp, and u1(t) the doublet at time t. The unit step u−1(t) is also commonly
represented as u(t), and the unit impulse u0(t) as δ(t).
