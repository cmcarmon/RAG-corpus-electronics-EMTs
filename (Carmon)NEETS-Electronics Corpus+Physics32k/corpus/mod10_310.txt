MULTIPATH is simply a term used to describe the multiple paths a radio wave may follow between 
transmitter and receiver. Such propagation paths include the ground wave, ionospheric refraction, 
reradiation by the ionospheric layers, reflection from the Earth's surface or from more than one 
ionospheric layer, etc. Figure 2-21 shows a few of the paths that a signal can travel between two sites in a 
typical circuit. One path, XYZ, is the basic ground wave. Another path, XEA, refracts the wave at the E 
layer and passes it on to the receiver at A. Still another path, XFZFA, results from a greater angle of 
incidence and two refractions from the F layer. At point Z, the received signal is a combination of the 
ground wave and the sky wave. These two signals having traveled different paths arrive at point Z at 
different times. Thus, the arriving waves may or may not be in phase with each other. Radio waves that 
are received in phase reinforce each other and produce a stronger signal at the receiving site. Conversely, 
those that are received out of phase produce a weak or fading signal. Small alternations in the 
transmission path may change the phase relationship of the two signals, causing periodic fading. This 
condition occurs at point A. At this point, the double-hop F layer signal may be in or out of phase with the 
signal arriving from the E layer.
