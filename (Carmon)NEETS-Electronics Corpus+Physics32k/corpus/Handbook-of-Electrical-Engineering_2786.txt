Accurate modeling of signals propagating on an interconnection requires detailed knowledge of the capac-
itance C* and inductance L* per unit length along the length of the line. As additional metal layers have been
provided,  capacitance  to  neighboring  lines  (on  different  or  the  same  metal  layer)  has  become  increasingly
important, even exceeding the capacitance to ground in some cases. Extraction of accurate interconnect delay
parameters may require the use of three-dimensional Ô¨Åeld solvers, with two-dimensional analysis used for less-
accurate modeling of signal behavior.
