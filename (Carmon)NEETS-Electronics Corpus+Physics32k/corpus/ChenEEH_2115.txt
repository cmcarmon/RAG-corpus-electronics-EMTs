where dtp(t) is the fuzzy delay associated with the arc (t , p)
(Murata, 1996). When there are no transitions in conﬂict with
transition t with its possibility interval pt [at, bt], the fuzzy
occurrence time is given by ot (t) ¼ et (t)  (at, at, bt, bt),
where we set pt ¼ 1 since no conﬂict exists. We use the
following formulas as approximate computations of the earli-
est and latest operations:
