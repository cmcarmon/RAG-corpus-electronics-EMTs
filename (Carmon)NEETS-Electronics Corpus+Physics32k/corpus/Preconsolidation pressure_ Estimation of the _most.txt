Using a consolidation curve, intersect the horizontal portion of the recompression curve and a line tangent to the compression curve. This point is within the range of probable preconsolidation pressures. It can be used in calculations that require less accuracy or if a rough estimate is all that is required.
See "Modeling Volume Change and Mechanical Properties with Hydraulic Models," from the Soil Science Society of America (link in references) for a more involved mathematical model based on Casagrande's method combining principles from soil mechanics and hydraulics.
