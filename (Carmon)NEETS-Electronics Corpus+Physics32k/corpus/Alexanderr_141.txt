Solution:
Note  that  meshes  1  and  2  form  a  supermesh  since  they  have  an
independent  current  source  in  common.  Also,  meshes  2  and  3  form
another  supermesh  because  they  have  a  dependent  current  source  in
common. The two supermeshes intersect and form a larger supermesh
as shown. Applying KVL to the larger supermesh,
