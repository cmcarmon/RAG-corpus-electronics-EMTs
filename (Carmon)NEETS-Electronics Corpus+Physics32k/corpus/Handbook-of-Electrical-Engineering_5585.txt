against  making  the  protection  faster  than  a  minimum  limit.  Also,  occasionally,  it  may  be  necessary  to  slow
down a protection system in order to satisfy some speciﬁc system need. In general, the fastest protection available
operates in about 5 to 10 ms after the inception of a fault [Thorp et al., 1979]. If the protection is made faster
than  this,  it  is  likely  to  become “trigger  happy”  and  operate  falsely  when  it  should  not.  When  a  protection
system is intended as a backup system for some other protection, it is necessary to deliberately slow it down
so that the primary protection may operate in its own time before the backup system will operate. This calls
for a deliberate slowing of the backup protection. Depending upon the type of backup system being considered,
the protection may sometimes be slowed down to operate in up to several seconds.
