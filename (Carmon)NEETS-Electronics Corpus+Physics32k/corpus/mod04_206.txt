The spare conductors of a multiconductor cable should be laced separately, and then tied to active 
conductors of the cable with a few telephone hitches. When two or more cables enter an enclosure, each 
cable group should be laced separately. When groups are parallel to each other, they should be bound 
together at intervals with telephone hitches (figure 2-47).
