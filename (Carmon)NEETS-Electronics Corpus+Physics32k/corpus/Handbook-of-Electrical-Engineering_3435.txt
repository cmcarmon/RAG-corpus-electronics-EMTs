: An A/D conversion process requiring three steps: the analog signal is sampled,
quantized, and encoded into a ﬁxed length digital code. This technique is used in many digital voice and
audio systems. The reverse process reconstructs an analog signal from the PCM code. The operation is
very similar to other A/D techniques, but speciﬁc PCM circuits are optimized for the particular voice or
audio application.
