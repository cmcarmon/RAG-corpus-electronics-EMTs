FIGURE 40.25 Examples of simultaneously measured lightning-induced voltages at the east end (E) and west end (W) of
a 450-m line. Each line end is either open or terminated in its characteristic impedance, as noted. Directions to the lightning
are determined from the ratio of the horizontal magnetic ﬂux densities (B’s) or from a commercial lightning location system
(LLP).  (Source: Adapted  from  N.  Georgiadis  et al., “Lightning-induced  voltages  at  both  ends  of  a  450-meter  distribution
