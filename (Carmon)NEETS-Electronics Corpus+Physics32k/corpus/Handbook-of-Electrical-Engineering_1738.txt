A typical reconstruction problem is tomography, in which each measurement is obtained by integrating the
pixel values along a ray through the image. Figure 17.9 illustrates the measurement of these ray integrals in the
projection process. For each angle u a set of ray integrals is computed by varying the position t at which the
ray passes through the image. The points along a ray are given by all the solutions (x,y) to the equation
