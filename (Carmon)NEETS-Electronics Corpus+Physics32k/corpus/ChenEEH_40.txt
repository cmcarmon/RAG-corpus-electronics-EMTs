It can be shown that the star subnetwork connected as shown
in Figure 1.14 can be converted into an equivalent delta sub-
network. The element values between the two subnetworks are
related as shown in Table 1.3. It should be noted that the star
subnetwork has four nodes, whereas the delta network has only
three nodes. Hence, the star network can be replaced in a
circuit without affecting the voltages and currents in the rest
