books (this one included) and in the writings of professional scientists, especially solid-state
physicists who are concerned with the actual motion of electrons in substances. These pref-
erences are cultural, in the sense that certain groups of people have found it advantageous to
envision electric current motion in certain ways. Being that most analyses of electric circuits do
not depend on a technically accurate depiction of charge ﬂow, the choice between conventional
ﬂow notation and electron ﬂow notation is arbitrary . . . almost.
