agnetic bearings support moving machinery without physical contact. For example, they can
levitate a rotating shaft and permit relative motion without friction or wear. Long considered
a  promising  advancement,  magnetic  bearings  are  now  in  actual  service  in  such  industrial
applications as electric power generation, petroleum reÔ¨Åning, machine tool operation, and natural gas
pipelines.
