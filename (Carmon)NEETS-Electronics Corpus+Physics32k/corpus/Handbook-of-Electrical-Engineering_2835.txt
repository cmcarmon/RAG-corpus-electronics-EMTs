Each IC manufacturer’s data books will have packaging information for their products. The engineer should
be familiar with the term “lead pitch”, which means the center-to-center distance between IC leads. Pitch may
be  in  thousandths  of  an  inch,  also  known  as  mils,  or  in  millimeters.  Common  pitches  are  0.050  in.  (50  mil
pitch), 0.025 in. (25 mil pitch) frequently called “ﬁne pitch”, and 0.020 in. and smaller frequently called “ultra-
ﬁne pitch”. Metric equivalents are 1.27 mm, 0.635 mm, and 0.508 mm and smaller. Conversions from metric
to inches are easily approximated if one remembers that 1 mm approximately equals 40 mils.
