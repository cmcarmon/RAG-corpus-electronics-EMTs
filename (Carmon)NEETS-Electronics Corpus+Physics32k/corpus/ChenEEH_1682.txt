CBIR Systems: Query By Image Content
The Ô¨Åeld of content-based indexing and retrieval has been an
active area of research for the past few decades. The research
effort that has gone into development of techniques for this
problem has led to some very successful systems currently
available as commercial products as well as other research
systems available for the academic community. Some of these
CBIR systems include Virage (Bach et al., 1996), Netra (Ma and
Manjunath, 1997), PhotoBook (Pentland et al., 1996), Visual-
Seek (Smith and Chang, 1996b), WebSeek (Smith and Chang,
1997), MARS (Mehrotra et al., 1997), and BlobWorld (Carson
et al., 1997). A comparative study of many of the CBIR systems
can be found in (Venters and Cooper, 2000). This section,
for illustrative purposes, reviews one example of a commercial
CBIR system known as Query By Image Content (QBIC).
