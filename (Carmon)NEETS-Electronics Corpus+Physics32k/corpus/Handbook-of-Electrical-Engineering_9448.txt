The  mean  time  to  repair  (MTTR)  is  simply  the  average  time  required  to  repair  a  system.  The  MTTR  is
extremely difﬁcult to estimate and is often determined experimentally by injecting a set of faults, one at a time,
into a system and measuring the time required to repair the system in each case. The MTTR is normally speciﬁed
in terms of a repair rate, m, which is the average number of repairs that occur per time period. The units of
the repair rate are normally number of repairs per hour. The MTTR and the rate, m, are related by
