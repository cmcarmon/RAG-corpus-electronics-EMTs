The occurrence of underpotential deposition is often interpreted as a result of a strong interaction between the electrodepositing metal M with the substrate S (of which the electrode is built). The M-S interaction needs to be energetically favoured to the M-M interaction in the crystal lattice of the pure metal M. This mechanism is deduced from the observation that UPD typically occurs only up to a monolayer of M (sometimes up to two monolayers). The electrodeposition of a metal on a substrate of the same metal occurs at an equilibrium potential, thus defining the reference point for the underpotential deposition. Underpotential deposition is much sharper on monocrystals than on polycrystalline materials.
