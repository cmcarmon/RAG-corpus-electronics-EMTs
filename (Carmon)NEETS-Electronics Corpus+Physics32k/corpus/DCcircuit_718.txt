Sometimes, shunt resistors are used in conjunction with voltmeters of high input resistance
to measure current. In these cases, the current through the voltmeter movement is small
enough to be considered negligible, and the shunt resistance can be sized according to how
many volts or millivolts of drop will be produced per amp of current:
