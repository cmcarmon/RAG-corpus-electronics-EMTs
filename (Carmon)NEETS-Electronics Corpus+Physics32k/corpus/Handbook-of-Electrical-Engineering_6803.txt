The concept of AIN is that new services can be developed and introduced into the network without requiring
carriers to wait for switch generics to be upgraded. Some AIN applications introduce powerful service-creation
capabilities which allow nonprogrammers to invoke basic functions offered in the network and stitch together
those functions, as illustrated in Fig. 72.16, to constitute a new service. As a result, AIN promises to dramatically
shorten the interval required to develop new services. Perhaps of greater signiﬁcance, it promises to broaden
the participation in service creation. In addition, it offers the opportunity to personalize or customize services.
The silicon revolution has driven the cost of memory down to the point where it is economically viable to have
enough memory in the network to store the service scripts or call processing scenarios that are unique to individuals.
Many people think of the AIN as a collection of network elements, network systems and operations systems;
this view might be called a technologist’s view. Perhaps a better representation is shown in Fig. 72.17; it shows
a collection of people—people empowered to create services.
