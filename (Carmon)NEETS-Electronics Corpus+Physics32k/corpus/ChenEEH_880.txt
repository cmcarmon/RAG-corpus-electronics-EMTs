In this section, a different class of clock skew scheduling
algorithms is introduced. In these algorithms, the primary
objective is to improve circuit reliability by maximizing the
tolerance to process parameter variations. Improvements are
achieved by Ô¨Årst choosing an objective clock skew value for
each local data path. A consistent clock schedule is found by
applying the proposed optimization algorithm. Unlike a per-
formance optimization approach, the algorithm presented in
this section minimizes the least square error between the com-
puted and objective clock skew schedules.8 A secondary ob-
jective of the clock skew scheduling algorithm developed in
this chapter is to increase the system-wide clock frequency.
