To apply a retrieved case to the new problem, the previous
solution may need to be modiﬁed to ﬁt the current problem.
There are two general types of modiﬁcation: structural and
derivational. In structural modiﬁcation, simple changes, such
as substituting values or adjusting and interpolating numerical
numbers, are made to the retrieved solution to make it work
for the new problem. In derivational modiﬁcation, procedures
that generated the previous solutions are run again to generate
a new solution to the new case.
