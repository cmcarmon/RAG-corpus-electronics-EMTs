Planar antennas are printed on a dielectric circuit board,
typically with ground metallization on one side. These an-
tennas are typically compatible with conventional planar trans-
mission lines, such as microstrip, coplanar waveguide (CPW),
and coplanar stripline (CPS), and may be integrated with other
microwave circuitry. For this reason, planar antennas are often
referred to as integrated antennas. These antennas are low
proÔ¨Åle and low cost. At microwave- and millimeter-wave fre-
quencies, they are also typically quite compact. As the operat-
ing frequency of commercial wireless systems is consistently
pushed higher, it becomes more feasible and economical to
integrate the antenna and system on a single printed circuit
board (PCB) or even on a die at millimeter-wave frequencies.
In this section, four planar antennas are described, including
the microstrip patch antenna, the slot antenna, the tapered
slot antenna and the quasi-Yagi antenna. The section con-
cludes with a brief discussion about the active integrated
antenna approach.
