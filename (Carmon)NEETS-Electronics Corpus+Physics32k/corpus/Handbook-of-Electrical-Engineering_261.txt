It can also be shown that KCL can be extended to apply to the Fourier transforms and the Laplace transforms
of the currents in a circuit. Thus, a single relationship between the currents at the nodes of a circuit applies to
all of the known mathematical representations of the currents [Ciletti, 1988].
