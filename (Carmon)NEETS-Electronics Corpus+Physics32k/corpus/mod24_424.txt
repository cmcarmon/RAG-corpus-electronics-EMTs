Star and tree couplers are multiport couplers that have more than two input or two output ports. A
star coupler is a passive device that distributes optical power from more than two input ports among
several output ports. Figure 4-27 shows the multiple input and output ports of a star coupler. A tree
coupler is a passive device that splits the optical power from one input fiber to more than two output
fibers. A tree coupler may also be used to combine the optical power from more than two input fibers into
a single output fiber. Figure 4-28 illustrates each type of tree coupler. Star and tree couplers distribute the
input power uniformly among the output fibers.
