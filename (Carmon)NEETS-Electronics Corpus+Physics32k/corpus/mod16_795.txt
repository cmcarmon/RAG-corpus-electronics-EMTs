1-59. Bandpass filters and band reject filters 
are tuned circuits that either pass or reject 
specific frequencies. In these filters, (a) 
what type offers very high impedance to 
currents at its resonant frequency, and (b) 
what type offers a very low impedance to 
currents at its resonant frequency?
