Example 14 
 
The voltage appearing at the secondary winding of 
a transformer is shown in Fig. A8.19. Determine: 
 
(a)   the period of the voltage 
(b)   the value of the voltage when (i) t = 5 ms and  
 
(c)   the maximum and minimum values of voltage 
(d)   the  average  value  of  the  voltage  during  the
