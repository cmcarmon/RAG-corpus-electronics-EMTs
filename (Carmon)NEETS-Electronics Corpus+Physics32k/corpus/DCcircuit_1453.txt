Comparison RC analysis
* first, the netlist for the original circuit:
v1 1 0 dc 20
r1 1 2 2k
r2 2 3 500
r3 3 0 3k
c1 2 3 100u ic=0
* then, the netlist for the thevenin equivalent:
v2 4 0 dc 1.818182
r4 4 5 454.545
c2 5 0 100u ic=0
* now, we analyze for a transient, sampling every .005 seconds
* over a time period of .37 seconds total, printing a list of
* values for voltage across the capacitor in the original
* circuit (between modes 2 and 3) and across the capacitor in
* the thevenin equivalent circuit (between nodes 5 and 0)
