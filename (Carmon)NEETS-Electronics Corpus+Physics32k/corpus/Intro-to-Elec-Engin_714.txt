7.4.18 Find idealized expressions for the active and
ohmic states and sketch the universal character-
istics of an n-channel enhancement MOSFET op-
erated below breakdown.
7.4.19 Let the circuit in Example 7.4.2 have VDD = 12 V
and RD = 2 k, and let the MOSFET have very
large VA, VT = 2.5 V, and IDSS = 8.3 mA.
(a) Determine vGS and vDS when iD = 4 mA.
(b) Determine iD and vDS when the gate voltage is
