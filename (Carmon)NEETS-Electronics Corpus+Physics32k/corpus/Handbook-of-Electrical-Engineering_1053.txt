For example, the Fourier series expansion of the sawtooth waveform illustrated in Fig. 14.1 is characterized
by T = 2p, wo = 1, a0 = 0, and an = a–n = A cos(np)/(jnp) for n = 1, 2, …. The coefﬁcients of the exponential
Fourier series given by Eq. (14.5b) can be interpreted as a spectral representation of s(t), since the anth coefﬁcient
represents the contribution of the (nwo)th frequency component to the complete waveform. Since the an terms
are complex valued, the Fourier domain (spectral) representation has both magnitude and phase spectra. For
example, the magnitude of the an values is plotted in Fig. 14.2 for the sawtooth waveform of Fig. 14.1. The fact
that the an terms constitute a discrete set is consistent with the fact that a periodic signal has a line spectrum;
