are  current  and  voltage  transformers,  which  transform  high
voltages  and  currents  to  a  more  manageable  level.  In  the
United States, the most common standard for current trans-
formers is a secondary current of 5 A (or less) for steady-state
conditions.  In  Europe,  and  in  some  other  foreign  countries,
a 1-A standard is also common. The voltage transformer stan-
dard  is  69.3 V  line-to-neutral  or  120 V  line-to-line  on  the
transformer secondary side. Standardization of the secondary
current and voltage ratings of the transducers has permitted
independent development of the transducers and relays. The
power handling capability of the transducers is expressed in
terms of the volt-ampere burden, which they can supply with-
out signiÔ¨Åcant waveform distortion. In general, the transient
response of the transducers is much more critical in relaying applications.
