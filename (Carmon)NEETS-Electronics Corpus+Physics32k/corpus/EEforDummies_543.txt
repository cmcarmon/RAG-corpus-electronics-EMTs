Exactly how these N‐type and P‐type semiconductors are combined deter­
mines what sort of semiconductor device they become — and how they 
allow current to flow (or not) when voltage is applied. The pn‐junction is 
the foundation for solid‐state electronics, which involves electronic devices 
made of solid, non‐moving materials, rather than the vacuum tubes of yore. 
Semiconductors have replaced the majority of vacuum tubes in electronics.
