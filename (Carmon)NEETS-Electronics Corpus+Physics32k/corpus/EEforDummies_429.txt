Here the letter Z denotes a tolerance of +80% to –20%. This tolerance means 
that the capacitor, rated at 0.01 μF, may have an actual value that’s as much 
as 80% higher or 20% lower than the stated value. Table 7‐3 lists the mean-
ings of common code letters used to indicate capacitor tolerance. Note that 
the letters B, C, and D represent tolerances expressed in absolute capaci-
tance values, rather than percentages. These three letters are used on only 
very small (pF range) capacitors.
