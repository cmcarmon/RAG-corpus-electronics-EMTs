The early active ﬁlters, based as they were on tube ampliﬁers, did not constitute any signiﬁcant advance over
their passive counterparts. It required the advent of solid-state active devices to make the RC-active ﬁlter a viable
alternative.  Over  the  subsequent  three  decades,  active  ﬁlter  theory  has  developed  to  an  advanced  state,  and  this
development continues as new IC technologies create opportunities for novel network structures and applications.
