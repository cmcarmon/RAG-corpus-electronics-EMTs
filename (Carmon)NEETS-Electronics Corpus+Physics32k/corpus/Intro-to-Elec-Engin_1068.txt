12.3.4 Consider the balanced three-phase alternating
currents, shown in Figure P12.3.4(a), to be ﬂow-
ing in phases a, b, and c, respectively, of the two-
pole stator structure shown in Figure P12.3.4(b)
with balanced three-phase windings. For instants
t = t1, t3, and t5 of Figure P12.3.4(a), sketch
the individual phase ﬂux contributions and their
resultants in vectorial form.
