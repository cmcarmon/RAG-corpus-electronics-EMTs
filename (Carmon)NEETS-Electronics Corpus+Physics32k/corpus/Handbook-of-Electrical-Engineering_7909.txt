An alternative ﬂip-ﬂop is the transparent latch, an interesting development of the simple latch. When enabled
by a control signal, C, by setting C high or “1”, the latch becomes a transparent section of the data path and
the data value at the input simply reappears at the output. When the control signal disables the latch, that is
C is low or “0”, however, the last value applied to the latch is “frozen” and held until the control signal is taken
high  again.  The  74LS373,  Fig. 81.29(a),  consists  of  eight  transparent  latches  with  a  common  control  input
labeled  ENABLE.  The  74LS374,  Fig. 81.29(b),  is  a  typical  eight-bit  register  using  positive  edge-triggering  for
all ﬂip-ﬂops. It includes 3S output gates designed speciﬁcally for driving highly capacitive loads, such as are
found in bus-organized systems, and which respond to an output control signal operating quite independently
of the ﬂip-ﬂops. Typical minimum timing ﬁgures for the 74LS373 and 74LS374 are shown in Fig. 81.29(c) and
the waveforms occurring for the two different types of register are illustrated in Fig. 81.29(d).
