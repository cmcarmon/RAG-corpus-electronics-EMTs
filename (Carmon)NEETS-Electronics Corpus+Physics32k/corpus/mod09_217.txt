Virtually every piece of equipment that uses an oscillator has two stability requirements, 
AMPLITUDE STABILITY and FREQUENCY STABILITY. Amplitude stability refers to the ability of 
the oscillator to maintain a constant amplitude in the output waveform. The more constant the amplitude 
of the output waveform, the better the amplitude stability. Frequency stability refers to the ability of the 
oscillator to maintain its operating frequency. The less the oscillator varies from its operating frequency, 
the better the frequency stability.
