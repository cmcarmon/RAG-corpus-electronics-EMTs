Sunstroke is more accurately called heatstroke since a person does not have to be exposed to the sun 
for this condition to develop. It is a less common but far more serious condition than heat exhaustion, 
since it carries a 20 percent fatality rate. The main feature of heatstroke is the extremely high body 
temperature, 105ยบ F (41ยบ C) or higher, that accompanies it. In heatstroke, the victim has a breakdown of 
the sweating mechanism and is unable to eliminate excessive body heat built up while exercising. If the 
body temperature rises too high, the brain, kidneys, and liver may be permanently damaged.
