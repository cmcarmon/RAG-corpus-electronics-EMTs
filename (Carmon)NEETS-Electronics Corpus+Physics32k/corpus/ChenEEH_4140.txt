After we recover the carrier, we must reestablish the carrier
phase to determine the values of the received bits. Somewhere
in the transmitted signal must be a known bit pattern that we
can use to determine the carrier phase. The bit pattern can be
alternating zeros and ones that we use to determine bit timing,
or it could be some other known pattern.
