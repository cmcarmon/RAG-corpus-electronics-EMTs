Torque multipliers are often used instead of extended handles, often called "cheater bars". Extended handles use leverage instead of gear reduction to achieve torque. This torque is transmitted through the driving tool and could become dangerous in the case of a sudden catastrophic failure of the drive tool with the extended handle attached. Torque multipliers only have a fraction of the final torque pressure on the drive tool making them a safer choice. There exists a company manufacturing torque multipliers as "CheaterBars".
Torque multipliers typically employ an epicyclic gear train having one or more stages. Each stage of gearing multiplies the torque applied. In epicyclic gear systems, torque is applied to the input gear or ‘sun’ gear. A number of planet gears are arranged around and engaged with this sun gear, and therefore rotate. The outside casing of the multiplier is also engaged with the planet gear teeth, but is prevented from rotating by means of a reaction arm, causing the planet gears to orbit around the sun gear. The planet gears are held in a ‘planet carrier' which also holds the output drive shaft. As the planet gears orbit around the sun gear, the carrier and the output shaft rotate together. Without the reaction arm to prevent rotation of the outer casing, the output shaft cannot apply torque.
Along with the multiplication of torque, there is a decrease in rotational speed of the output shaft compared to the input shaft. This decrease in speed is inversely proportional to the increase in torque. For example, a torque multiplier with a rating of 3:1 will turn its output shaft with three times the torque, but at one third the speed, of the input shaft. However, due to friction and other inefficiencies in the mechanism, the output torque is slightly lower than the theoretical output.
