2; n// and n^ are the refractive indices of the parallel and perpendicular
linearly polarized modes, respectively. The difference in phase velocities between these two waves gives rise to
a magnetic linear birefringence (MLB) of light which is also known as the CM or Voigt effect. In this case, the
light transmitted through the crystal has elliptic polarization. The degree of ellipticity depends on the difference
n// â€“ n^. The phase shift or retardation can be found by the following expression:
