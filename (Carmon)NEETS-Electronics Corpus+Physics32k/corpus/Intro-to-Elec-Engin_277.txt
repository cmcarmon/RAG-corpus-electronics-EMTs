) because of continuity of
capacitor voltage. Figure 3.3.2 shows the time-domain networks and the transformed network
equivalents in the frequency domain for elements R, L, and C. Notice the inclusion of the initial
inductor current by means of the voltage term [Li(0
)] and the initial capacitor voltage by the
voltage [v(0
)/s]. Source conversion can be applied to obtain alternate transformed equivalent
networks, as shown in Figure 3.3.2.
