The HydroEngine is a video game engine created by Blade Interactive for their video game Hydrophobia for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360; it will also be the first to use the gaming engine. Developed over three years, it has a unique capability which allows modelling of flowing water and other liquids for the first time. It is entirely dynamic, which means the effect is not repeated and thus allowing different effects each time. The engine can also interface with solid body physics engines such as Havok, which allows objects and debris to be carried with the flow. Another new development platform, called the InfiniteWorldsGCS, interfaces directly with the HydroEngine. According to the developers it is "an underlying architecture, which can interface with bespoke editors tailored to individual game projects".
