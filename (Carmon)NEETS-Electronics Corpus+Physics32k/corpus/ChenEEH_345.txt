In the above equation, WD is the depletion region width
under the inversion layer, and b is a ﬁtting parameter. The
model indicates that DVT is a strong function of the lDIBL term
in the exponential and must be minimized. This requires
higher doping density in the channel to reduce WD and down-
scaling of the gate oxide thickness, tox. The model does not
include the well-known dependence of DVT on source/drain
junction depths although some modiﬁcations have been sug-
gested.
