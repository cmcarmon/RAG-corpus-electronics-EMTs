The enormous demands that the war put on the world also marked the indispensable and strategic
place  of  electric  power.  Electric  power  rose  to  the  status  of  necessity,  not  only  increasing  the  general
industrial consumption of power, but also highlighting specialized uses of electricity, such as the pro-
duction of aluminum and explosives, that were critical to the pursuit of the war. In Europe, the targeting
of power plants and dams by both allied and axis bombers provided proof of electricityâ€™s central place
in modern warfare.
