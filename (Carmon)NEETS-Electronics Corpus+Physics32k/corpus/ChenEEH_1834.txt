groups inform their immediate-neighboring routers using the
Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP). Multicasting is
trivial on a single ethernet segment (where packets can be
multicast using the multicast MAC address). For delivering a
multicast packet from the source to the destination nodes on
other networks, however, multicast routers need to exchange
the information they have gathered from the group member-
ship of the hosts directly connected to them. There are many
different algorithms such as ï¬‚ooding, spanning tree, reverse path
broadcasting, and reverse path multicasting for exchanging the
routing information among the routers. Some of these algo-
rithms have been used in dynamic multicast routing protocols
such as Distance Vector Multicast Routing Protocol
(DVMRP), Multicast Extension to Open Shortest Path First
(MOSPF), and Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) (Sahas-
rabuddhe and Mukherjee, 2000). Based on the routing infor-
mation obtained through one of these protocols, whenever a
multicast packet is sent out to a multicast group, multicast
routers will decide whether to forward that packet to their
network(s) or not.
