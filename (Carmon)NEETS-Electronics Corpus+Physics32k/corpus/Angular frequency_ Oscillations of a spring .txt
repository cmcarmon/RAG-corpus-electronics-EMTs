An object attached to a spring can oscillate. If the spring is assumed to be ideal and massless with no damping, then the motion is simple and harmonic with an angular frequency given by




ω
=



k
m



,


{\displaystyle \omega ={\sqrt {\frac {k}{m}}},}

where
k is the spring constant,
m is the mass of the object.
ω is referred to as the natural frequency (which can sometimes be denoted as ω0).
As the object oscillates, its acceleration can be calculated by




a
=
−

ω

x
,


{\displaystyle a=-\omega ^{2}x,}

where x is displacement from an equilibrium position.
Using "ordinary" revolutions-per-second frequency, this equation would be

{\displaystyle a=-4\pi ^{2}f^{2}x.}
