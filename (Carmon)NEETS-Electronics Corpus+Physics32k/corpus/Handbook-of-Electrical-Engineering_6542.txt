A useful ﬁgure of merit for these systems is the product of the system data rate and its length. This ﬁgure
of  merit  is  the  well-known  rate-length  product.  The  bandwidth  of  the  transmitting  and  receiving  circuits
(including the light source and photodetector) limits the achievable system data rate. The bandwidth of the
