Ethernet  and  802.3  networks  have  raw  speeds  of  up  to  10  million  bits  per  second  (Mbps).  Idle  time  and
collisions, however, can reduce the useful information throughput signiﬁcantly. The maximum length of these
networks is limited by signal propagation delay. An 802.3 coaxial bus differs from an internal computer bus in
size and in the lack of a bus controller. Ethernet connections can also be made over unshielded twisted pair or,
for long runs, over ﬁber optics.
