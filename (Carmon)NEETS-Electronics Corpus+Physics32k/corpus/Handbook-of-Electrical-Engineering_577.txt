The advantage of this method is that the transfer characteristics of a nonlinear circuit can be directly used;
an explicit power-series expansion is not required. Both the power-series and the differential-error techniques
cannot  be  applied  when  only  the  output  waveform  is  known.  In  such  a  situation  the  distortion  factors  are
calculated from the output signal waveform by a simpliÔ¨Åed Fourier analysis as described in the next section.
