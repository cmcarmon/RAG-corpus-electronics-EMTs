A waveform other than a sine wave is called a COMPLEX WAVE. You will see that a complex 
wave consists of a fundamental frequency plus one or more HARMONIC frequencies. The shape of a 
nonsinusoidal waveform is dependent upon the type of harmonics present as part of the waveform, their 
relative amplitudes, and their relative phase relationships. In general, the steeper the sides of a waveform, 
that is, the more rapid its rise and fall, the more harmonics it contains.
