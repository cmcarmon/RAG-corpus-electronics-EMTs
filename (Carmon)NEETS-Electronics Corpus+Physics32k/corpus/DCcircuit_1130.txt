We know that the current is equal at all points in a series circuit, so whatever amount of
current there is in any one of the series-connected batteries must be the same for all the others
as well. For this reason, each battery must have the same amp-hour rating, or else some of the
batteries will become depleted sooner than others, compromising the capacity of the whole bank.
Please note that the total amp-hour capacity of this series battery bank is not affected by the
number of batteries.
