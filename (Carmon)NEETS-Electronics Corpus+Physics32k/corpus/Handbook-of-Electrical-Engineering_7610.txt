The S-R NAND latch implementation shown in Fig. 79.17 uses two cross-coupled NAND gates. The tildes
shown in the logic circuit diagram preceding S and R represent inline symbols for the logical complements of
S and R, respectively, as recommended by the IEEE. Data books usually refer to the S-R NAND latch as the
S R-
 latch. The logic symbol recommended for the S-R NAND latch by IEEE is shown to the right of the logic
circuit diagram.
