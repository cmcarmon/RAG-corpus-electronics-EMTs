where  IS  is  the  reverse  saturation  current  (about  10–14  A  for  a
small-signal  diode);  VT  =  kT/q  is  the  thermal  voltage  equal  to
26 mV  at  room  temperature;  k  =  Boltzmann’s  constant,
1.38 · 10–23  J/K; T  is  the  absolute  temperature  in  kelvin; q  is  the
elementary  charge  1.602·10–19 C;  m  is  the ideality factor,  m  =  1
for medium currents, m = 2 for very small and very large currents;
IS is part of the total reverse current IR of the diode IR = IS + IG;
and IS is the reverse saturation current and IG is the generation-
recombination current, also called diode leakage current because
IG is not a part of the carrier diffusion process in the diode. ID is
exponentially related to VD in Fig. 22.10.
