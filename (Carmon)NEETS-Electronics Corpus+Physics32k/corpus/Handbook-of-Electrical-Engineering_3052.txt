where K is a constant chosen by the designer and which provides the capacity to scale component values in
the  ﬁnal  ﬁlter.  Since  impedance  transformations  do  not  affect  voltage  and  current  transfer  ratios,  the  VTF
remains unaltered by this change. The Bruton transformation is applied directly to the elements in the prototype
network, and it follows from Eq. (29.10) that a resistance R transforms into a capacitance C = K/R, while an
inductance L transforms into a resistance R = KL. The elimination of inductors in favor of resistors is the key
purpose of the Bruton transform method. Applying the Bruton transform to a prototype circuit capacitance
C gives
