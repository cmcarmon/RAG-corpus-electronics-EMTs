Introduction
Microstrip antenna technology has been the most rapidly developing topic in the antenna Ô¨Åeld in the last 15
years,  receiving  the  creative  attentions  of  academic,  industrial,  and  government  engineers  and  researchers
throughout the world. As a result, microstrip antennas have quickly evolved from a research novelty to com-
mercial reality, with applications in a wide variety of microwave systems. Rapidly developing markets in personal
communications systems (PCS), mobile satellite communications, direct broadcast television (DBS), wireless
local-area  networks  (WLANs),  and  intelligent  vehicle  highway  systems  (IVHS)  suggest  that  the  demand  for
microstrip antennas and arrays will increase even further.
