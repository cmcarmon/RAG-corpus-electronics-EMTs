The Lagrange multiplier




λ

i




{\displaystyle \lambda _{i}}
is related to a constraint condition




C

i


=
0


{\displaystyle C_{i}=0}
and usually represents a force or a moment, which acts in “direction” of the constraint degree of freedom. The Lagrange multipliers do no "work" as compared to external forces that change the potential energy of a body.
