The second term in equation 3.26 is not always zero for an arbi-
trary plane wave, even though E0  k Â¼ 0, since k may be com-
plex in the most general case. If either k or E0 is proportional to
a real vector (i.e., all of the components of the vector have the
same phase angle), then it is easily demonstrated that the second
term vanishes. In this case, the Poynting vector becomes:
