The PCA network is a one-layer network with linear-processing elements (Fig. 20.14). One can extend Oja’s
rule  for  many-output  PEs  (less  or  equal  to  the  number  of  input  PEs),  according  to  the  formula  shown  in
Fig. 20.14 which is called the Sanger’s rule [Haykin, 1994]. The weight matrix rows (that contain the weights
connected to the output PEs in descending order) are the eigenvectors of the input correlation matrix. If we
set the number of output PEs equal to M < D, we will be projecting the input data onto the M largest principal
components. Their outputs will be proportional to the M largest eigenvalues. Note that we are performing an
eigendecomposition through an iterative procedure.
