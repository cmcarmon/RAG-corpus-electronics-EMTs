Inductance measurements are seldom required in the course of troubleshooting. However, in some
cases inductance measurements are useful and instruments are available for making this test. Many
capacitance test sets can be used to measure inductance. Most manufacturers of capacitance test sets
furnish inductance conversion charts if the test equipment scale is not calibrated to read the value of
inductance directly. For the measurement of inductance, the following basic types of test equipment
circuitry are used: (1) the bridge-circuit type, which is the most accurate, and (2) the reactance type,
which is often an additional test circuit incorporated into another piece of test equipment to increase its
utility. The measurement of capacitance using the capacitance-inductance-resistance bridge instrument
was discussed. Since the measurement of capacitance and inductance are interrelated, the existing
capacitance standards and loss controls of this test equipment are used whenever possible. A wider range
of dissipation must be provided to accommodate the practical value of inductors. The 250DE+1325 (view
A of fig. 1-14), a typical rcl bridge and our reference in this discussion, uses two basic bridge circuits
(Hay bridge and Maxwell bridge) to accommodate the extensive range in inductor loss factors. You
should take time to review the bridges in NEETS, module 16, or other bridge-circuit descriptions before
continuing.
