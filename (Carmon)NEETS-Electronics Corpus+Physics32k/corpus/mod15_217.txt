Signal lights indicate either overload conditions or blown fuses. Overload indicators are usually 
placed in the stator circuit of a torque synchro system because the stator circuit gives a better indication of 
mechanical loading than does the current in the rotor circuit. One version of this type of indicator, as 
shown in figure 1-44, consists of a neon lamp connected across the stator leads of a synchro system by 
two transformers. The primaries, consisting of a few turns of heavy wire, are in series with two of the 
stator leads; the secondaries, consisting of many turns of fine wire, are in series with the lamp. The turns 
ratios are designed so that when excess current flows through the stator windings, the neon lamp lights. 
For example, when the difference in rotor positions exceeds about 18ยบ, the lamp lights, indicating that the 
load on the motor shaft is excessive.
