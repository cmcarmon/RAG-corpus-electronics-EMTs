The magnitude of an earthquakes can be roughly estimated by measuring the area affected by intensity level III or above in square kilometres and taking the logarithm. A more acurrate estimate relies on the development of regional calibration functions derived using many isoseismal radii. Such approaches allow magnitudes to be estimated for historical earthquakes.
