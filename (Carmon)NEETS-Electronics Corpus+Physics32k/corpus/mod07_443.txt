Another thing to keep in mind is that the ripple component (E) of the output voltage is an ac voltage 
and the average output voltage (Eavg) is the dc component of the output. Since the filter capacitor offers a 
relatively low impedance to ac, the majority of the ac component flows through the filter capacitor. The 
ac component is therefore bypassed (shunted) around the load resistance, and the entire dc component (or
