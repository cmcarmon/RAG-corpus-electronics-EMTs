Outdoor insulators are subjected to a variety of stresses in
service, such as mechanical, electrical, and environmental
stresses. These stresses act in unison. The exact nature and
magnitude of these stresses varies signiÔ¨Åcantly and depends
on the details of insulator design, application, and location.
For example, suspension and dead-end insulators encounter a
tensile load due to the weight and tension of the conductor.
Wind and ice impose additional loading. Insulators used for a
supporting station apparatus encounter a compressive me-
chanical load. Line-post insulators are subjected to a cantilever
or bending load in supporting the conductor. These loads are
to be expected under steady-state conditions. In additional,
transient loading conditions can be generated. A torsional or a
