Elementary Induction Machines
In the discussion that followed Equation (12.4.32), the third possible method of producing constant
torque was to cause the mmf axes of stator and rotor to rotate at such speeds relative to their
windings that they remain stationary with respect to each other. If the stator and rotor windings
are polyphase and carry polyphase alternating current, then both the stator mmf and the rotor
mmf axes may be caused to rotate relative to their windings. Such a machine will have polyphase
stator ac excitation at ωs, polyphase rotor ac excitation at ωr, and the rotor speed ωm satisfying
