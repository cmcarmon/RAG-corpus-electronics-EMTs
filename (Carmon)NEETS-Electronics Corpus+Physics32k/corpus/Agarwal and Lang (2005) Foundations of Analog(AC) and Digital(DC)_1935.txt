Frequency cutoff begins in the vicinity of the break frequency. Hence the
break frequency is also called the cutoff frequency. Thus we can design our RC
low-pass filter to have any cutoff frequency by an appropriate choice of the RC
time constant. As pictured in Figure 13.33, the higher the value of RC, the
lower the cutoff frequency of the filter.
