Automatic Tracking
Consider a track at a certain radial location, say r0, and imagine viewing this track through the access window
shown  in  Fig. 80.21.  It  is  through  this  window  that  the  head  gains  access  to  arbitrarily  selected  tracks.  To  a
viewer looking through the window, a perfectly circular track centered on the spindle axis will look stationary,
irrespective of the rotation rate. However, any eccentricity will cause an apparent radial motion of the track.
The peak-to-peak distance traveled by a track (as seen through the window) depends on a number of factors
including centering accuracy of the hub, deformability of the substrate, mechanical vibrations, manufacturing
tolerances,  etc.  For  a  typical  3.5-in.  disk,  for  example,  this  peak-to-peak  motion  can  be  as  much  as  100  mm
during one revolution. Assuming a revolution rate of 3600 rpm, the apparent velocity of the track in the radial
direction will be several millimeters per second. Now, if the focused spot remains stationary while trying to read
from or write to this track, it is clear that the beam will miss the track for a good fraction of every revolution cycle.
Practical solutions to the above problem are provided by automatic tracking techniques. Here the objective
is placed in a Ô¨Åne actuator, typically a voice coil, which is capable of moving the necessary radial distances and
