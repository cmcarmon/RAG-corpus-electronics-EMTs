As in the beginning, the capacitor voltage is now lower than the output and
therefore the capacitor begins to charge up. This cycle repeats and results in a
square wave at the output of the Op Amp.
Let us derive the time period of the oscillator in Figure 15.31. Assume that
at time T1, vO transitions from VS to −VS as illustrated in Figure 15.35. We
