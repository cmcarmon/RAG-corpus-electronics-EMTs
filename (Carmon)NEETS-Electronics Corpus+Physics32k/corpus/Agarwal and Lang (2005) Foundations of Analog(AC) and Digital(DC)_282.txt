Since element #1 is connected in parallel with element #4, the voltages across them
must be the same. Thus, v1 = 5 V. Similarly, the voltage across the series connection of
elements #2 and #3 must also be 5 V, so v2 = 3 V. This latter result can also be obtained
through the counterclockwise application of KVL around the loop including elements
#2, #3, and #4, for example. This yields, v2 + 2 V âˆ’ 5 V = 0. Again, v2 = 3 V.
