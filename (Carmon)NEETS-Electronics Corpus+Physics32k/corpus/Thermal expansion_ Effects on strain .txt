For solid materials with a significant length, like rods or cables, an estimate of the amount of thermal expansion can be described by the material strain, given by




ϵ


t
h
e
r
m
a
l





{\displaystyle \epsilon _{\mathrm {thermal} }}
and defined as:





ϵ


t
h
e
r
m
a
l



=



(

L


f
i
n
a
l



−

L


i
n

t

)


L


i
n
i
t
i
a
l







{\displaystyle \epsilon _{\mathrm {thermal} }={\frac {(L_{\mathrm {final} }-L_{\mathrm {initial} })}{L_{\mathrm {initial} }}}}

where




L


i
n
i
t
i
a
l





{\displaystyle L_{\mathrm {initial} }}
is the length before the change of temperature and




L


f
i
n
a
l





{\displaystyle L_{\mathrm {final} }}
is the length after the change of temperature.
For most solids, thermal expansion is proportional to the change in temperature:





ϵ


t
h
e
r
m
a
l



∝
Δ
T


{\displaystyle \epsilon _{\mathrm {thermal} }\propto \Delta T}

Thus, the change in either the strain or temperature can be estimated by:





ϵ


t
h
e
r
m
a
l



=

α

L


Δ
T


{\displaystyle \epsilon _{\mathrm {thermal} }=\alpha _{L}\Delta T}

where




Δ

)


{\displaystyle \Delta T=(T_{\mathrm {final} }-T_{\mathrm {initial} })}

is the difference of the temperature between the two recorded strains, measured in degrees Celsius or kelvins, and




α

L




{\displaystyle \alpha _{L}}
is the linear coefficient of thermal expansion in “per degree Celsius” or “per kelvin”, denoted by °C−1 or K−1, respectively. In the field of continuum mechanics, the thermal expansion and its effects are treated as eigenstrain and eigenstress.
