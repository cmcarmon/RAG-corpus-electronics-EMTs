An  inductor  is  a  device  that  stores  energy  in  the  form  of  current.  The  most 
common form of inductors is a wire wound into a coil. The magnetic field generated by 
the wire creates a counter-acting electric field which impedes changes to the current. This 
effect is known as Lenzâ€™s law and is stated mathematically as
