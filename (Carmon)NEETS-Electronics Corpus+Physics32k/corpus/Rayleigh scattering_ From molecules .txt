The expression above can also be written in terms of individual molecules by expressing the dependence on refractive index in terms of the molecular polarizability Î±, proportional to the dipole moment induced by the electric field of the light. In this case, the Rayleigh scattering intensity for a single particle is given in CGS-units by
