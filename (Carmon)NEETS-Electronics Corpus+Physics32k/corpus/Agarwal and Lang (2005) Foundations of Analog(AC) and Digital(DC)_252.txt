The primary signals within a circuit are its currents and voltages, which we
denote by the symbols i and v, respectively. We define a branch current as the
current along a branch of the circuit (see Figure 2.4), and a branch voltage as the
potential difference measured across a branch. Since elements and branches are
the same for circuits formed of two-terminal elements, the branch voltages and
currents are the same as the corresponding terminal variables for the elements
forming the branches. Recall, as defined in Chapter 1, the terminal variables for
an element are the voltage across and the current through the element.
