The TRIG MODE section in figure 6-28 allows for automatic triggering or normal triggering. In
AUTO (automatic), the triggering will be free-running in the absence of a proper trigger input or will
trigger on the input signal at frequencies above 20 hertz. In NORM (normal), the vertical channel input
will trigger the sweep.
