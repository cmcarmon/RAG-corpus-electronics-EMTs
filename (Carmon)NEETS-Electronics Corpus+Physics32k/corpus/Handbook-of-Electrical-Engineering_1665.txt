Nonlinear Filters
Considering the frequently disappointing performance of the EKF noted in the previous section, there has been
intense  research  to  develop  better  nonlinear  ﬁlters. An  exact  nonlinear  recursive  ﬁlter  was  derived  by Bene˘s
(for a certain class of nonlinear problems) in a seminal paper [1981]. The Bene˘s ﬁlter is “exact” in the sense
that  it  computes  an  optimal  estimate  of  x,  without  any  approximations,  in  contrast  to  the  EKF,  which  uses
linear approximations. A generalization of the Bene˘s ﬁlter and the Kalman ﬁlter was developed by Daum [1986a;
1986b]. Figure 16.3 shows the superior performance of this new nonlinear ﬁlter compared to the EKF for certain
practical applications; see Schmidt [1993] for details. A more general class of exact nonlinear recursive ﬁlters
is based on the exponential family of probability densities. The  Kalman ﬁlter theory  is  based on a Gaussian
density, which is a special case of the exponential family; see Daum [1988; 1997a, b] for a development of this
theory, which is summarized in Table 16.2.
