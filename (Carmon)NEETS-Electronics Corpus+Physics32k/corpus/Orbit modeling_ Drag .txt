The primary non-gravitational force acting on satellites in low Earth orbit is atmospheric drag. Drag will act in opposition to the direction of velocity and remove energy from an orbit. The force due to drag is modeled by the following equation:

{\displaystyle \mathbf {F} _{D}}

ρ


{\displaystyle \mathbf {} \rho }
is the density of the fluid,







v


{\displaystyle \mathbf {} v}
is the velocity of the object relative to the fluid,








C

d




{\displaystyle \mathbf {} C_{d}}
is the drag coefficient (a dimensionless parameter, e.g. 2 to 4 for most satellites)







A


{\displaystyle \mathbf {} A}
is the reference area.
Orbits with an altitude below 120 km generally have such high drag that the orbits decay too rapidly to give a satellite a sufficient lifetime to accomplish any practical mission. On the other hand, orbits with an altitude above 600 km have relatively small drag so that the orbit decays slow enough that it has no real impact on the satellite over its useful life. Density of air can vary significantly in the thermosphere where most low Earth orbiting satellites reside. The variation is primarily due to solar activity, and thus solar activity can greatly influence the force of drag on a spacecraft and complicate long-term orbit simulation.
