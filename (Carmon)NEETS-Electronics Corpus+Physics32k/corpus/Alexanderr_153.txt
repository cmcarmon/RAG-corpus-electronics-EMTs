Solution:
The  schematic  is  shown  in  Fig.  3.35.  (The  schematic  in  Fig.  3.35
includes the output results, implying that it is the schematic displayed
on  the  screen  after the  simulation.)  Notice  that  the  voltage-controlled
voltage  source  E1  in  Fig.  3.35  is  connected  so  that  its  input  is  the
voltage  across  the  4-
resistor;  its  gain  is  set  equal  to  3.  In  order  to
display the required currents, we insert pseudocomponent IPROBES in
the  appropriate  branches. The  schematic  is  saved  as  exam311.sch and
simulated by selecting Analysis/Simulate. The results are displayed on
IPROBES as shown in Fig. 3.35 and saved in output ﬁle exam311.out.
From the output ﬁle or the IPROBES, we obtain 
A and
