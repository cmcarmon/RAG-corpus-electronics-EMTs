• Real circuits are distributed systems, not the “lumped element models” which are assumed by simulators.
Real  circuits,  therefore,  have  resistive,  capacitive,  and  inductive  parasitic  elements  present  besides  the
intended  components.  In  high-speed  circuits  these  parasitic  elements  are  often  the  dominant  perfor-
mance-limiting elements in the circuit, and must be painstakingly modeled.
