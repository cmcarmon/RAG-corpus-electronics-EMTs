Electrical  circuits  may  be  classiﬁed  into  various  categories.  Four  of  the  more  familiar  classiﬁcations  are
(a) linear and nonlinear circuits, (b) time-invariant and time-varying circuits, (c) passive and active circuits,
  circuit  can  be  described  by  a  set  of  linear  (differential)
linear
and  (d)  lumped  and  distributed  circuits.  A 
time-invariant
  circuit  or  system  implies  that  none  of  the
equations;  otherwise  it  is  a  nonlinear  circuit.  A

components  of  the  circuit  have  parameters  that  vary  with  time;  otherwise  it  is  a
