Following is a description of one of the two machines introduced in the 1846 patent. It has a capacity of five digits for the operator and ten digits for the operand and the result registers.
All the registers are located on the front panel, the reset mechanism is on the side.
10 numbered stems, arranged horizontally at the top of the front panel, can be pulled at different lengths to enter the operands with the rightmost stem representing units.
A 10 digit display register located in the middle is used to display the results.
5 dials, each coupled with an input key, are used to enter the operators with the rightmost dial representing units. Turning the units key one division clockwise will add the content of the operand register to the total. Turning the units key one division counterclockwise will subtract the content of the operand register from the current total. Turning the tens key one division clockwise will add 10 times the content of the operand register to the total etc..
