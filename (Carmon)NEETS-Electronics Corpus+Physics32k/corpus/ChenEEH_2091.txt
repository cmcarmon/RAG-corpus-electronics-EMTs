. NG ¼ (P, T , F) is a net graph. P and T are ﬁnite sets of
places and transitions such that P \ T ¼ . Elements in
P are represented by solid and dotted circles. Similarly,
elements in T are represented by solid and dotted boxes.
Solid circles or boxes are elementary nodes, and dotted
circles and boxes are super nodes. In particular, we iden-
tify two subsets IN  P [ T and OUT  P [ T such that
IN contains the heads of all incoming nonterminating
arcs (an arc inside a super node is a nonterminating arc if
one of its ends is connected to the boundary of the super
node) and OUT contains the tails of all outgoing non-
terminating arcs. Nodes in IN [ OUT are called interface
nodes. We use IN to denote the set of the presets of all
elements in IN (i.e., IN ¼ { njn 2 IN}), and OUT to
denote the set of the postsets of all elements in OUT. F is
the set of arcs and is called the ﬂow relation, satisfying
the conditions: P \ F ¼ , F \ T ¼ , and F  ( IN 
IN [ P  T [ T  P [ OUT  OUT). An arc f can be
uniquely identiﬁed by a pair of nodes (n1, n2) denoting
its source and sink, in which n1(n2) may denote the preset
(postset) of n2(n1) when f is a nonterminating arc.
