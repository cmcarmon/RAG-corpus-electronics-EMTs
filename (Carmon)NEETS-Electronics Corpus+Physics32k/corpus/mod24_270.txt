Figure 3-7 shows the refractive index profile n(r) for the depressed-clad single mode fiber. A
depressed-clad single mode step-index fiber has a core of radius (a) with a constant refractive index n1. A
cladding, made of two regions, surrounds the core. An inner cladding region surrounds the core of the
fiber and has a refractive index of n2. The inner cladding refractive index n 2 is lower than the core's
refractive index n1. An outer cladding region surrounds the inner cladding region and has a higher
refractive index n3 than the inner cladding region. However, the outer cladding refractive index n3 is
lower than the core's refractive index n1.
