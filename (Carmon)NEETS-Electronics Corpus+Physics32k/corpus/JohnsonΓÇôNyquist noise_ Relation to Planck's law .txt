Nyquist's formula is essentially the same as that derived by Planck in 1901 for electromagnetic radiation of a blackbody in one dimension—i.e., it is the one-dimensional version of Planck's law of blackbody radiation. In other words, a hot resistor will create electromagnetic waves on a transmission line just as a hot object will create electromagnetic waves in free space.
In 1946, Dicke elaborated on the relationship, and further connected it to properties of antennas, particularly the fact that the average antenna aperture over all different directions cannot be larger than

, where λ is wavelength. This comes from the different frequency dependence of 3D versus 1D Planck's law.
