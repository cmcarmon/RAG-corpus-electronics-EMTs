Anti vibration gloves are traditionally made with a thick and soft palm material to insulate from the vibrations. The protection is highly dependent on frequency range, most gloves provide no protection in palm and wrist below ~50Hz and in fingers below ~400Hz. Factors such as high grip force, cold hands or vibration forces in shear direction can have a reducing effect and or increase damage to the hands and arms. Gloves do help to keep hands warm but to get the desired effect, the frequency output from the tool must match the properties of the vibration glove that is selected. Anti Vibration gloves in many cases amplify the vibrations at frequencies lower than those mentioned in the text above.
