Scientists began to tailor instruments specifically for GRBs. The Helios-2 spacecraft carried a detector with precision time resolution to a Solar orbit that took it over one AU from Earth. Helios-2 was launched in 1976.
In 1978, multiple spacecraft were launched, forming the necessary baselines for a position determination. The Pioneer Venus Orbiter and its Soviet counterparts, Venera 11 and 12, took gamma detectors to the orbit of Venus. In addition, the spacecraft Prognoz-7 and ISEE-3 remained in Earth orbit. These formed an Earth-Venus-Sun triangle, and the probes at Venus formed a smaller triangle. 84 bursts were detected, until the network degraded in 1980. The Pioneer Venus Orbiter continued until it entered the Venus atmosphere in 1992, but not enough other spacecraft were functioning to form the required baselines.
On March 5 and 6, 1979, two bursts of hard X-rays were detected from the same source in the constellation Dorado by the Î³-ray burst detector Konus, on the Venera 11 and Venera 12 spacecraft. These X-ray bursts were detected by several other spacecraft. As part of the InterPlanetary Network (IPN), Venera 11, Venera 12 were hit by the March 5, 1979, hard X-ray burst at ~10:51 EST, followed 11 s later by Helios 2 in orbit around the Sun, then the Pioneer Venus Orbiter at Venus. Seconds later the Vela satellites, Prognoz 7, and the Einstein Observatory in orbit around Earth were inundated. The last satellite hit was the ISEE-3 before the burst exited the Solar System.
