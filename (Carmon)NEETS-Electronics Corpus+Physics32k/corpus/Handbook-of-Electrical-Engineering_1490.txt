The primary advantages of continuous speech are two-fold. First, typical speaking rates for continuous speech
are  140 to  170  words  per  minute,  while  isolated  word  mode  speakers  seldom  exceed  70  words  per  minute.
Secondly,  continuous  speech  is  a  natural  mode  of  human  communication.  Forcing  pauses  between  words
introduces  artiﬁciality  and  reduces  user  friendliness.  The  unnaturalness  of  isolated  word  speech  breaks  the
speaker’s train of thought.
