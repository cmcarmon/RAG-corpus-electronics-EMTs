from the same fault being detected on multiple test vectors) causes the ﬁnal test signature to be correct even
though interim signatures were wrong. The probability that a faulty circuit signature will be the same as the
good  circuit  signature  is  known  as  aliasing  probability.  It  can  be  shown  that  if  the  test  length  is  sufﬁciently
long, aliasing probability diminishes toward 2-t, where t is the number of bits of the signature register [Dervi-
soglu, 1985].
