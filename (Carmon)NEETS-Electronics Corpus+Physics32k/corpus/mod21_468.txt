DISTORTION is a term used by technicians and engineers alike that generally signifies 
dissatisfaction with the shape of the wave processed by an amplifier. Distortion of a waveform is the 
undesired change or deviation in the shape of the observed signal with respect to a reference waveform. 
Classifying any waveform as a distorted wave without reference to the electronic circuitry involved is 
meaningless. A waveform that can be validly termed distorted with respect to a specific amplifier circuit 
may be the normal waveform to be expected from another amplifier circuit. One of the most important 
steps in waveform analysis, the one that usually proves the most difficult for the maintenance personnel, 
is the interpretation of patterns viewed on the test equipment.
