cascade to realize the required overall TF, as shown in Fig. 29.3. A ﬁrst-order section is also required to realize
odd-order TF speciﬁcations. These second-order sections may, depending on the exact form of the overall TF
speciﬁcation, be required to realize numerator terms of up to second order. An RC-active network capable of
 denominator polynomials are second-order) is
