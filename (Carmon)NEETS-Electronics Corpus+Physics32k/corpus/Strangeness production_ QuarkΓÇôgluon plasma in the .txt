Free quarks probably existed in the extreme conditions of the very early universe until about 30 microseconds after the Big Bang, in a very hot gas of free quarks, antiquarks and gluons. This gas is called a quark–gluon plasma (QGP), since the quark-interaction charge (color charge) is mobile and quarks and gluons move around. This is possible because at a high temperature the early universe is in a different vacuum state, in which normal matter cannot exist but quarks and gluons can, they are deconfined (able to exist independently as separate unbound particles). In order to recreate this deconfined phase of matter in the laboratory it is necessary to exceed a minimum temperature, or its equivalent, a minimum energy density. Scientists achieve this using particle collisions at extremely high speeds, where the energy released in the collision can raise the subatomic particles' energies to an exceedingly high level, sufficient for them to briefly form a tiny amount of quark-gluon plasma which can be studied for a brief fraction of a second before it cools again. In this way, it is possible to study conditions akin to those in the early Universe at the age of 10–40 microseconds. Discovery of this new QGP state of matter has been announced both at CERN and at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL). At this time comprehensive experimental evidence about its properties is being assembled.
The process of the formation of quark–gluon plasma lasts little longer than the time the light takes to pass through the volume occupied by the atomic nucleus used to produce the ultra-high pressure and temperature in the highly-energetic collision. After this brief time the hot drop of quark plasma evaporates in a process called hadronization. The extremely limited duration of the plasma makes it challenging (difficult) to study free quarks in quark–gluon plasma.
