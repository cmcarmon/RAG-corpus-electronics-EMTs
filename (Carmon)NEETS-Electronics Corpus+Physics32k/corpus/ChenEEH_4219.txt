Each station is connected to a multipoint repeater, and each
input to the repeater is repeated on every output link. If two
inputs overlap, a jam signal is transmitted on all output links.
The class 1 repeater can support mixtures of transmission
media types; a class 2 repeater can support only the same
transmission media type, but it can interconnect with another
class 2 repeater. Each network can be conﬁgured as either a full
duplex or half duplex. The full duplex operation requires a
switch hub and not a multipoint repeater. In the full duplex
operation, each station would own the entire bandwidth of the
network. In the half duplex operation, each station would
share the bandwidth of the transmission medium. To support
a mixture of speeds on a network, each device can send link
integrity pulses to indicate the speed it supports. The process is
called autonegotiation. The priority order in the technology
ability ﬁeld used in the 100BASE-T autonegotiation scheme is
based on the highest common denominator regarding abilities.
The 100BASE-T4 medium has the higher priority than the
100BASE-FX, and the 100BASE-T4 provides for the operation
over a wider range of twisted pair cables and, therefore, is more
ﬂexible. The 10BASE-T is the lowest common denominator
and has the lowest priority. In general, a full-duplex capability
can also operate in half duplex mode and, hence, has a higher
priority. The priority is assigned in the following order from
highest to lowest:
