Single error signal/single secondary source systems cannot achieve global cancellation or sound control in a
room.  An  intuitive  argument  for  this  fact  is  that  one  needs  at  least  as  many  secondary  sources  and  error
microphones as there are orthogonal wave modes in the room. Since the number of wave modes in a room
below a given frequency is approximately proportional to the third power of this frequency, it is clear that ANC
(and ASC) is practical only at low frequencies. In practice, using small (point-source) transducers, it turns out
that one should use more error microphones than secondary sources. Examples of such multidimensional ANC
systems are employed for cancelling the lowest few harmonics of the engine noise in an airplane cabin and in
a passenger car. In both of these cases, the adaptive Ô¨Ålter matrix is controlled by a multiple-error version of
the LMS algorithm. Further information can be found in Nelson and Elliott [1992].
