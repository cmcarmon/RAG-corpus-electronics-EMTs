Equation (100.165) is often referred to as the time update equation. It represents the estimate of the state
vector that results from knowledge of the system dynamics. Equation (100.166) is sometimes called the mea-
surement  update  equation  because  it  revises  the  time  update  with  a  so-called  innovations  term  L(y  â€“  y)  that
adjusts this time update according to the error between the output expected from the time update, y(k + 1),
and the actual, measured output, y(k + 1).
