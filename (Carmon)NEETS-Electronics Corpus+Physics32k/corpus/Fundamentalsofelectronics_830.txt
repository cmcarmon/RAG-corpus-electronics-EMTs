This receiver multiplies the received signal by each of the possible members of the transmitter signal set,
integrates the product over the bit interval, and compares the results. Whichever path through the receiver
yields the largest value corresponds to the receiverâ€™s decision as to what bit was sent during the previous bit
interval. For the next bit interval, the multiplication and integration begins again, with the next bit decision
