Microwave tubes perform the same functions of generation and amplification in the microwave 
portion of the frequency spectrum that vacuum tubes perform at lower frequencies. This section will 
explain the basic operation of the most widely used microwave tubes, including klystrons, traveling-wave 
tubes, backward-wave oscillators, magnetrons, and crossed-field amplifiers. The variations of these tubes 
for use in specific applications are so numerous that all of them cannot be discussed in this module. 
However, general principles of operation are similar in all of the variations so the explanations will be 
restricted to the general principles of operation.
