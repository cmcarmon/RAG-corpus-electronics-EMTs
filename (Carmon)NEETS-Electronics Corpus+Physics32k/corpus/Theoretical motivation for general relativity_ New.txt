Newton's Law of Gravitation in non-relativistic mechanics states that the acceleration on an object of mass

r



{\displaystyle \mathbf {f} ={d^{2}\mathbf {r}  \over d\tau ^{2}}=-{GM \over {c^{2}r^{3}}}\mathbf {r} }

where



G


{\displaystyle G}
is the gravitational constant,




r



{\displaystyle \mathbf {r} }
is a vector from mass



M


{\displaystyle M}
to mass



m


{\displaystyle m}
and



r


{\displaystyle r}
is the magnitude of that vector. The time t is scaled with the speed of light c
