Figure 9.20 shows the possible inductor combinations that use up to three induc-
tors. To determine their equivalent inductances, use the series combination result
from Equation 9.45 and/or the parallel combination result from Equation 9.48. This
yields the equivalent inductances of: (A) 1 µH, (B) 0.5 µH, (C) 2 µH, (D) 0.333 µH,
(E) 0.667 µH, (F) 1.5 µH, and (G) 3 µH.
