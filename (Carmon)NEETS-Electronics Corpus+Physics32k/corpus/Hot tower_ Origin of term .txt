The hot tower hypothesis was proposed in 1958 by Herbert Riehl and Joanne Simpson (then Joanne Malkus) after extensive study of moist static energy profiles in the tropics. Prior to 1958, the mechanism driving the global-scale circulation pattern called Hadley cells was poorly understood. Riehl and Simpson proposed that the energy feeding these convective cells was supplied by the release of latent heat during condensation and subsequent freezing of warm, moist air in areas of convection about 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) wide. The large horizontal extent of these convective cells provides a buffer from the dry air surrounding the convective region that allows the parcel to rise at nearly the moist adiabatic lapse rate. NOAA also defined the term Towering cumulonimbus in 2009.
