LEDs, incandescent light bulbs, resistors, and 
other  electronic  components  have  maximum 
power  ratings  for  a  good  reason.  Send  too 
much current through them, and they overheat 
and burn or melt. It is good practice to estimate 
the power requirement for each component in a 
circuit you design. Using the fact that power is 
the product of voltage and current, you  consider
