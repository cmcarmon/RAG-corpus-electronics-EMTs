In theoretical computer science, nondeterministic constraint logic is a combinatorial system in which an orientation is given to the edges of a weighted undirected graph, subject to certain constraints. One can change this orientation by steps in which a single edge is reversed, subject to the same constraints. It is PSPACE-complete to determine whether there exists a sequence of moves that reverses a specified edge.
This is a form of reversible logic in that each sequence of edge orientation changes can be undone. The hardness of this problem has been used to prove that many games and puzzles have high game complexity.
