The  required  input  optical  switching  energy  density  can  be  quite  low  if  the
device  without  light  is  biased  critically  just  below  threshold.  Since  incoherent
light from an LED cannot be effectively collected from small devices or focused
onto small devices, a lasing pnpn is needed. Microlaser-based structures are also required to reduce the total
power dissipation to acceptable levels. Surface-emitting microlasers provide an ideal laser because of their small
size, single-mode operation, and low thresholds. The surface-emitting microlasers consist of two AlAs/AlGaAs
dielectric mirrors with a thin active layer in between. This active layer typically consists of one or a few MQWs.
The material can be etched vertically into small posts, typically 1â€“5 mm in diameter. Thresholds are typically
on the order of milliwatts.
