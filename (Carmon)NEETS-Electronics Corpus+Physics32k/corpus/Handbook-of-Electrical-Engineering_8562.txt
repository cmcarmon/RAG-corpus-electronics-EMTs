I/O System and Interrupts
Programming support for I/Os and interrupts is more complicated than for straight machine instructions. This
is due to the considerable speed differences between I/O devices and a CPU, the need for synchronization, the
need for not losing any external event, and the concerns for optimizing processing time. Microprogramming
offers  considerable  design  ï¬‚exibility,  as  these  problems  are  more  easily  handled  by  programming  than  with
hardware components.
