Body-fixed axes, or "body axes", are defined and fixed relative to the body of the vehicle.:
X body axis is aligned along the vehicle body and is usually positive toward the normal direction of motion.
Y body axis is at a right angle to the x body axis and is oriented along the wings of the vehicle. If there are no wings (as with a missile), a "horizontal" direction is defined in a way that is useful. The Y body axis is usually taken to be positive to right side of the vehicle.
Z body axis is perpendicular to wing-body (XY) plane and usually points downward.
