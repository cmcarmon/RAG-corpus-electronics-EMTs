discharge path time constant of C2, R1, and R2 is chosen to be longer than the period (1/f) of the lowest
audio frequency present in the output of the detector. Because of the longer time constant, C2 will not
discharge much between peaks of the modulating signal, and the voltage across C2 will be essentially a dc
voltage. This voltage is proportional to the average signal amplitude. Now, if the signal strength varies,
C2 will either increase or decrease its charge, depending on whether the signal increases or decreases.
Since the charge on the agc capacitor responds only to changes in the average signal level, instantaneous
variations in the signal will not affect the agc voltage.
