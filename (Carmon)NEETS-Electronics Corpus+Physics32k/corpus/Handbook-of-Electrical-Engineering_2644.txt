In such a case, the onâ€“off behavior of the MOSFET is not controlled by the gate alone, and switching can occur
over a range of gate voltages dependent on the drain voltage. Reliable circuit design under these circumstances
is  very  complicated,  and  testing  for  design  errors  is  prohibitive.  Hence,  in  designing  MOSFETs,  a  drain-bias
independent subthreshold behavior is necessary.
