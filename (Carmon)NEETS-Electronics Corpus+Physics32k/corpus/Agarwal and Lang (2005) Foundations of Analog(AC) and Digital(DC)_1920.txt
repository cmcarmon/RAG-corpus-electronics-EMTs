as a straight line with +1 slope on log-log scales. This implies that the
magnitude of the transfer function (or the impedance of the inductor)
increases with increasing frequency.
Because L = 1 µH, the magnitude curve for the inductor passes through
unity for ω = 1/L = 106 rad/s.
In contrast, the magnitude curve for the capacitor appears as a straight
line with −1 slope on log-log scales. This implies that the magnitude of
the transfer function decreases with increasing frequency.
Because C = 1 µF, the magnitude curve for the capacitor passes through
unity for ω = 1/C = 106 rad/s.
