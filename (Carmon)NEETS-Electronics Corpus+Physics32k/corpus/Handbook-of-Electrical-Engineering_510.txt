The impedance scaling factor is 600/1 = 600 and the frequency scaling factor is 2p500/1 = 2p500: that is,
the ratio of the desired radian cut-off frequency to the normalized cut-off frequency (1 rad/s). Note that the
impedance scaling factor increases the size of the resistors and inductors, but reduces the size of the capacitors.
The result is shown in Fig. 4.8(b).
