where  R  =  10log  (bit  rate  in  bit/s),  B  is  the  bandwidth  (dB  Hz),  and  (C/No)  is  the  carrier-to-thermal  noise
density ratio, that is, (C/N) normalized to unit bandwidth. Curves relating the communications performance
measure of (BER) vs. (Eb /No) for different modulations may be found in [Sklar, 1988]. The link equation may
then be expressed in terms of (Eb /No) and data rate, R, without explicit reference to the bandwidth:
