The frequency of a pulsed oscillator is determined by both the input gating signal and the resonant 
frequency of the tank circuit. When a sinusoidal oscillator is resonant at 1 megahertz, the output is 1 
million cycles per second. In the case of a pulsed oscillator, the number of cycles present in the output is 
determined by the gating pulse width.
