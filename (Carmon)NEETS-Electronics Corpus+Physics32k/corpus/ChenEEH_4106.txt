The digital signals that are generated in the process of trans-
mitting voice, data, and signaling information are generated at
low data rates. These data rates, typically 1 to 50 kbps, are low
enough in frequency that their transmission directly from the
transmitter to the receiver would require antennas that are
thousands of meters long. Furthermore, the signals from one
transmitter would interfere with the signals from another
transmitter if they all used the same frequency band. There-
fore, the baseband signals are modulated onto a radio fre-
quency carrier for transmission from the transmitter to the
receiver. The radio environment at 800 to 2000 MHz is hostile.
We must therefore choose modulation methods that are robust
in this hostile environment. In addition to the modulation
methods, we must also choose encoding algorithms that im-
prove the performance of the system.
