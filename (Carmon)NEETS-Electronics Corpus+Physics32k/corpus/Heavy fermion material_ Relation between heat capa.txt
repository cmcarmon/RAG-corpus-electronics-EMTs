For electrons with a quadratic dispersion relation (as for the free-electron gas), the Fermi energy εF is inversely proportional to the particle's mass m:

{\displaystyle \epsilon _{F}={\frac {\hbar ^{2}k_{F}^{2}}{2m}}}

where kF stands for the Fermi wave number that depends on the electron density and is the absolute value of the wave number of the highest occupied electron state. Thus, because the Sommerfeld parameter γ is inversely proportional to εF, γ is proportional to the particle's mass and for high values of γ, the metal behaves as a free electron gas in which the conduction electrons have a high thermal effective mass.
