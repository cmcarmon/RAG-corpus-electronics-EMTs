The Earth's gravity field can be described by a potential as follows:





g

=
∇
W
=

g
r
a
d


W
=



∂
W


∂
X




i

+



∂
W


∂
Y




j

+



∂
W


∂
Z




k



{\displaystyle \mathbf {g} =\nabla W=\mathrm {grad} \ W={\frac {\partial W}{\partial X}}\mathbf {i} +{\frac {\partial W}{\partial Y}}\mathbf {j} +{\frac {\partial W}{\partial Z}}\mathbf {k} }

which expresses the gravity acceleration vector as the gradient of



W


{\displaystyle W}
, the potential of gravity. The vector triad



{

i

,

j

,

k

}


{\displaystyle \{\mathbf {i} ,\mathbf {j} ,\mathbf {k} \}}
is the orthonormal set of base vectors in space, pointing along the



X
,
Y
,
Z


{\displaystyle X,Y,Z}
coordinate axes.
Note that both gravity and its potential contain a contribution from the centrifugal pseudo-force due to the Earth's rotation. We can write




W
=
V
+
Φ



{\displaystyle W=V+\Phi \,}

where



V


{\displaystyle V}
is the potential of the gravitational field,



W


{\displaystyle W}
that of the gravity field, and



Φ


{\displaystyle \Phi }
that of the centrifugal force field.
The centrifugal force -- per unit of mass, i.e., acceleration -- is given by






g


c


=

ω

2



p

,


{\displaystyle \mathbf {g} _{c}=\omega ^{2}\mathbf {p} ,}

where





p

=
X

i

Y

j

0
⋅

k



{\displaystyle \mathbf {p} =X\mathbf {i} +Y\mathbf {j} +0\cdot \mathbf {k} }

is the vector pointing to the point considered straight from the Earth's rotational axis. It can be shown that this pseudo-force field, in a reference frame co-rotating with the Earth, has a potential associated with it that looks like this:




Φ
=


1
2



ω

2


(

X

2


+

Y

2


)
.


{\displaystyle \Phi ={\frac {1}{2}}\omega ^{2}(X^{2}+Y^{2}).}

This can be verified by taking the gradient (



∇


{\displaystyle \nabla }
) operator of this expression.
Here,



X


{\displaystyle X}
,



Y


{\displaystyle Y}
and



Z


{\displaystyle Z}
are geocentric coordinates.
