Power in mechanical systems is the combination of forces and movement. In particular, power is the product of a force on an object and the object's velocity, or the product of a torque on a shaft and the shaft's angular velocity.
Mechanical power is also described as the time derivative of work. In mechanics, the work done by a force F on an object that travels along a curve C is given by the line integral:

,


{\displaystyle W_{C}=\int _{C}{\mathbf {F}}\cdot {\mathbf {v}}\,\mathrm {d} t=\int _{C}{\mathbf {F}}\cdot \mathrm {d} {\mathbf {x}},}

where x defines the path C and v is the velocity along this path.
If the force F is derivable from a potential (conservative), then applying the gradient theorem (and remembering that force is the negative of the gradient of the potential energy) yields:

,


{\displaystyle W_{C}=U(B)-U(A),}

where A and B are the beginning and end of the path along which the work was done.
The power at any point along the curve C is the time derivative

{\displaystyle P(t)={\frac {\mathrm {d} W}{\mathrm {d} t}}={\mathbf {F}}\cdot {\mathbf {v}}=-{\frac {\mathrm {d} U}{\mathrm {d} t}}.}

In one dimension, this can be simplified to:

In rotational systems, power is the product of the torque τ and angular velocity ω,

{\displaystyle P(t)=pQ,\!}

where p is pressure in pascals, or N/m2 and Q is volumetric flow rate in m3/s in SI units.
