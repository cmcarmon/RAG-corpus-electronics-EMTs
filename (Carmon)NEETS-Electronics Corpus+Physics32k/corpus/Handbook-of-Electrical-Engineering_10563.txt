b
for various combinations of 
 is the angle
between  the  vertical  plane  of  the  row  of  luminaires  and  a
tilted plane containing both the seeing task and the luminaire
a
 and
or row of luminaires. Figure 107.2 shows how angles 
b
 are defined. The direct illumination component for each
luminaire or row of luminaires is determined by referring to
the table of direct illumination components for the speciÔ¨Åc
luminaire. The direct illumination components are based on
the assumption that the luminaire is mounted 6 ft above the
seeing  task.  If  this  mounting  height  is  other  than  6  ft,  the
direct  illumination  component  shown  in  Table  107.5  must
 is the mounting height above
be multiplied by 6/
the task. Thus the total direct illumination component would
  and  the  sum  of  the  individual  direct
be  the  product  of  6/
illumination components of each row.
