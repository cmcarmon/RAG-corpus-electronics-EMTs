Airplanes have been used since 1959 to provide a nearly weightless environment in which to train astronauts, conduct research, and film motion pictures. Such aircraft are commonly referred by the nickname "Vomit Comet".
To create a weightless environment, the airplane flies in a six-mile long parabolic arc, first climbing, then entering a powered dive. During the arc, the propulsion and steering of the aircraft are controlled such that the drag (air resistance) on the plane is cancelled out, leaving the plane to behave as it would if it were free-falling in a vacuum. During this period, the plane's occupants experience 22 seconds of weightlessness, before experiencing about 22 seconds of 1.8 g acceleration (nearly twice their normal weight) during the pull-out from the parabola. A typical flight lasts around two hours, during which 30 parabolae are flown.
