By definition, the mating ring is the non-flexible member of the mechanical seal. The design of the mating ring must allow for minimizing distortion and maximizing heat transfer while considering ease of assembly and the static secondary sealing element. The mating ring can contain the seal face diameters, although this is not a requirement of the mating ring. To minimize primary ring motion, the mating ring must be mounted solidly and should form a perpendicular plane for the primary ring to run against. Like seal rings, mating rings are available in many different shapes.
