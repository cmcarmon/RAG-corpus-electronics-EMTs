Figure 1-17 illustrates the relationship between the two frequencies (10 and 11 hertz). Since the 
waveforms are not of the same frequency, the 10 hertz of view (B) and the 11 hertz of view (A) will be in 
phase at some points and out of phase at other points. You can see this by closely observing the two 
waveforms at different instants of time. The result of the differences in phase of the two sine waves is 
shown in view (C). View (D) shows the waveform that results from the nonlinearity in the circuit.
