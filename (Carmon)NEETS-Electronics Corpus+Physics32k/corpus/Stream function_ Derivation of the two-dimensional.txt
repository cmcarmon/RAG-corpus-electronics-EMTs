Consider two points A and B in two-dimensional plane flow. If the distance between these two points is very small: δn, and a stream of flow passes between these points with an average velocity, q perpendicular to the line AB, the volume flow rate per unit thickness, δΨ is given by:




δ
ψ
=
q
δ
n



{\displaystyle \delta \psi =q\delta n\,}

As δn → 0, rearranging this expression, we get:




q
=



∂
ψ


∂
n






{\displaystyle q={\frac {\partial \psi }{\partial n}}\,}

Now consider two-dimensional plane flow with reference to a coordinate system. Suppose an observer looks along an arbitrary axis in the direction of increase and sees flow crossing the axis from left to right. A sign convention is adopted such that the flow velocity is positive.
