The temperature of stars other than the Sun can be approximated using a similar means by treating the emitted energy as a black body radiation. So:

{\displaystyle L=4\pi R^{2}\sigma {T_{e}}^{4}}

where L is the luminosity, σ is the Stefan–Boltzmann constant, R is the stellar radius and T is the effective temperature. This same formula can be used to compute the approximate radius of a main sequence star relative to the sun:

{\displaystyle {\frac {R}{R_{\odot }}}\approx \left({\frac {T_{\odot }}{T}}\right)^{2}\cdot {\sqrt {\frac {L}{L_{\odot }}}}}

where R☉, is the solar radius, L☉ is the solar luminosity, and so forth.
With the Stefan–Boltzmann law, astronomers can easily infer the radii of stars. The law is also met in the thermodynamics of black holes in so-called Hawking radiation.
