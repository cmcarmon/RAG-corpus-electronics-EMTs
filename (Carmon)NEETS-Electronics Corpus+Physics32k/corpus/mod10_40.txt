and understand those concepts. Through ample use of illustrations and a step-by-step transition from the
simple to the complex, we will help you develop a better understanding of wave propagation. In this
chapter, we will discuss propagation theory on an introductory level, without going into the technical
details that concern the engineer. However, you must still use thought and imagination to understand the
new ideas and concepts as they are presented.
