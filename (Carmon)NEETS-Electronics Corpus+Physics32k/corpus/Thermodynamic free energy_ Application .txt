Just like with the general concept of energy, free energy has multiple definitions, depending on the conditions. In physics, chemistry, and biology, these conditions are thermodynamic parameters (Temperature T, Volume V, Pressure P, etc.). Scientists have come up with many ways to define free energy while keeping certain parameters from changing; mathematically expressed as (. When temperature and volume are kept constant, this is known as Helmholtz free energy A. The mathematical expression of Helmholtz free energy is:




A
=
U
−
T
S


{\displaystyle A=U-TS}

This definition of free energy is useful in physics for explaining the behavior of isolated systems kept at a constant volume. In chemistry, on the other hand, most chemical reactions are kept at constant pressure. Under this condition, the heat of the reaction q is equal to the enthalpy H of the reaction, or all of the energy associated with the reaction. For example, if a researcher wanted to perform a combustion reaction in a bomb calorimeter, the pressure is kept constant throughout the course of a reaction per mole of the substance of the system (reactants and products). Therefore, the heat of the reaction is a direct measure of the enthalpy H of the reaction (q=). In this case, internal energy can be a measure of the enthalpy of the reaction in question (H=U). Thus under constant pressure and temperature, the free energy in a reaction is known as Gibbs free energy G.

{\displaystyle G=H-TS}

The experimental usefulness of these functions is restricted to conditions where certain variables (T, and V or external p) are held constant, although they also have theoretical importance in deriving Maxwell relations. Work other than p dV may be added, e.g., for electrochemical cells, or f dx work in elastic materials and in muscle contraction. Other forms of work which must sometimes be considered are stress-strain, magnetic, as in adiabatic demagnetization used in the approach to absolute zero, and work due to electric polarization. These are described by tensors.
In most cases of interest there are internal degrees of freedom and processes, such as chemical reactions and phase transitions, which create entropy. Even for homogeneous "bulk" materials, the free energy functions depend on the (often suppressed) composition, as do all proper thermodynamic potentials (extensive functions), including the internal energy.
Ni is the number of molecules (alternatively, moles) of type i in the system. If these quantities do not appear, it is impossible to describe compositional changes. The differentials for reversible processes are (assuming only pV work):

Any decrease in the Gibbs function of a system is the upper limit for any isothermal, isobaric work that can be captured in the surroundings, or it may simply be dissipated, appearing as T times a corresponding increase in the entropy of the system and/or its surrounding.
An example is surface free energy, the amount of increase of free energy when the area of surface increases by every unit area.
The path integral Monte Carlo method is a numerical approach for determining the values of free energies, based on quantum dynamical principles.
