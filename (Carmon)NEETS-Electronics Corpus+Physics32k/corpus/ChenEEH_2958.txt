The Ô¨Årst variable represents the noise ampliÔ¨Åed (or attenu-
ated) by the network. The second, Pne, represents the excess
noise generated by the network itself. In addition, if the input
noise temperature, Ts, is held at 0 Kelvin, the output noise
power will consist of only Pne. The noisy two-port can be
replaced by a noiseless two-port giving the same noise power
output. This is done by deÔ¨Åning an effective noise temperature
of the two-port network itself, Te:
