12.4.2 In Problem 12.4.1 neglect the saturation of the
core, leakage, and fringing. Neglect also the re-
luctance of the ferromagnetic circuit. Assuming
that the cross-sectional area of the center leg
is twice the area of the outer legs, obtain ex-
pressions for the inductance of the coil and the
electromagnetic force on the plunger.
