OPEN-LOOP VOLTAGE GAIN A
The op amp ampliﬁes the difference vd between the voltage on the noninverting (+) terminal
and the inverting (−) terminal; see Figure 5.3.2. The term “open loop” implies that there is no
external feedback connection between the output and either of the inputs. A is deﬁned as the
ratio of the change in output voltage to the change in differential input voltage, usually for a load
resistance of no less than 2 k. A typical value for A is 2 × 105.
