Figure 1-16 is a block diagram of an amplifier with negative feedback. In this case, the feedback 
signal is out of phase with the input signal. This means that the feedback signal will subtract from or 
"degenerate" the input signal. This results in a lower amplitude output signal than would occur without 
the feedback.
