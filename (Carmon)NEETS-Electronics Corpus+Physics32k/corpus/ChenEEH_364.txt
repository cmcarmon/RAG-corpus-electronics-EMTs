Although the MESFET structure resembles the MOSFET, its
operation is much closer to that of the JFET. Figure 22 shows
the MESFET cross-section in different regions of operation.
The MESFET has a conductive path between the source and
the drain since the channel is of the same conductivity type as
the junctions. Therefore, to turn-off a MESFET, a sufÔ¨Åciently
high gate bias must be applied to deplete the channel. The
depletion region under the gate modulates the width and the
resistance of the conductive channel from source to drain. As
such, in a MESFET, the Schottky gate plays the exact same role
that the pn junction gate plays in a JFET.
