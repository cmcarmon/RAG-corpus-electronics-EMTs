With the switch in the discharge position, the battery is replaced by a wire 
(or, rather, two jumper wires and an internal connection in the breadboard, 
which together are the equivalent of a single wire connection). The capacitor 
discharges and current flows through the resistor and LED2, which lights as 
long as the capacitor is discharging. After the capacitor stops discharging, 
current stops flowing and LED2 goes out.
