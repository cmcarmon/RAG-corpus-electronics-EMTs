The last device we will discuss is the resolver. Physically, resolvers are similar to synchros, and are
used to perform mathematical computations electrically. They are rotary electromechanical devices that
provide outputs that are trigonometric functions of their inputs. As you may know, the branch of
mathematics that deals with the quantities and angles of a right triangle is known as trigonometry. Many
"trig" problems that can be solved with paper and pencil can be solved by applying the proper electrical or
mechanical quantities to a resolver. The resolver has the advantage of giving instantaneous solutions if the
input quantities are changing continuously.
