This concludes our discussion of the first part of large signal analysis for
a MOSFET based amplifier, namely, determining the relationship between the
input and output voltage. Before we move on to the second part of large
signal analysis, it is worth spending a few moments comparing the graphical
method and the analytical method. To be sure, either method can be used in
most situations. The analytical method is useful when simple expressions cap-
ture the behavior of the devices, as was the case for our MOSFET amplifier.
The graphical method discussed in this section, however, is often more accu-
rate when device characteristics measured from a physical device are available.
The discrete devices you will come across in the laboratory, for example, will
often come with data sheets containing their v i characteristics.
