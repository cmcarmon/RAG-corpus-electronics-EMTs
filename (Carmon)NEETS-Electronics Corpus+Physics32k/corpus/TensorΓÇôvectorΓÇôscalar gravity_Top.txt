Tensor–vector–scalar gravity (TeVeS), developed by Jacob Bekenstein in 2004, is a relativistic generalization of Mordehai Milgrom's Modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) paradigm.
The main features of TeVeS can be summarized as follows:
As it is derived from the action principle, TeVeS respects conservation laws;
In the weak-field approximation of the spherically symmetric, static solution, TeVeS reproduces the MOND acceleration formula;
TeVeS avoids the problems of earlier attempts to generalize MOND, such as superluminal propagation;
As it is a relativistic theory it can accommodate gravitational lensing.
The theory is based on the following ingredients:
A unit vector field;
A dynamical scalar field;
A nondynamical scalar field;
A matter Lagrangian constructed using an alternate metric;
An arbitrary dimensionless function.
These components are combined into a relativistic Lagrangian density, which forms the basis of TeVeS theory.
