Within the frequency range between 50 and 500 MHz, nonlinear gain and loss, intervalence-band absorption,
and, more importantly, spatial-hole burning (SHB) and carrier leakage can all be signiÔ¨Åcant. Carrier leakage
prevents all of the current injected in the laser bond wire from entering the active layer. This leakage must be
reduced to immeasurable levels for AM-VSB applications.
