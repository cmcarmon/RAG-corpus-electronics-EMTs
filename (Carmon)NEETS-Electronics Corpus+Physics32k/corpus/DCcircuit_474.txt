Once again we ﬁnd that the original numbering scheme used to identify points in the circuit
will have to be altered for the beneﬁt of SPICE. In SPICE, all electrically common points must
share identical node numbers. This is how SPICE knows what’s connected to what, and how.
In a simple parallel circuit, all points are electrically common in one of two sets of points. For
our example circuit, the wire connecting the tops of all the components will have one node
number and the wire connecting the bottoms of the components will have the other. Staying
true to the convention of including zero as a node number, I choose the numbers 0 and 1:
