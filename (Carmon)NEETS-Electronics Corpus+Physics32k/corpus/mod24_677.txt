Transmitter output interfaces generally fall into two categories: optical connectors and optical fiber
pigtails. Optical pigtails are attached to the transmitter optical source. This pigtail is generally routed out
of the transmitter package as a coated fiber in a loose buffer tube or a single fiber cable. The pigtail is
either soldered or epoxied to the transmitter package to provide fiber strain relief. The buffer tube or
single fiber cable is also attached to the transmitter package to provide additional strain relief.
