require only
sequential addressing, such as the ﬁrst-in ﬁrst-out
(FIFO) queue or ﬁrst-in last-out (FILO) or stack struc-
tures, which put a severe restriction on the order in
which the data are read out. Still, this restriction is
acceptable for many applications. A more general but
still sequential access order is available in a pointer-
addressed memory (PAM). In most cases, however, the
address sequence should be random (including repeti-
tion), which requires a direct addressing scheme. Then,
an important requirement is that in this case, the access
time should be independent of the address selected.
