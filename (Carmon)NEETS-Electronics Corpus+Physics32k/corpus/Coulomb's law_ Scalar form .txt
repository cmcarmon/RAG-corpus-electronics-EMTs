When it is only of interest to know the magnitude of the electrostatic force (and not its direction), it may be easiest to consider a scalar version of the law. The scalar form of Coulomb's Law relates the magnitude and sign of the electrostatic force F acting simultaneously on two point charges q1 and q2 as follows:

F

=

k

e

q

1



q

2



|



r

2






{\displaystyle |{\boldsymbol {F}}|=k_{e}{|q_{1}q_{2}| \over r^{2}}}

where r is the separation distance and ke is Coulomb's constant. If the product q1q2 is positive, the force between the two charges is repulsive; if the product is negative, the force between them is attractive.
