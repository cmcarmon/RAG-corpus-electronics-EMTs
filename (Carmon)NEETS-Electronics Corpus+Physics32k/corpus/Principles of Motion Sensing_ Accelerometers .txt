Accelerometers measure linear acceleration and tilt angle. Single and multi-axis accelerometers detect the combined magnitude and direction of linear, rotational and gravitational acceleration. They can be used to provide limited motion sensing functionality. For example, a device with an accelerometer can detect rotation from vertical to horizontal state in a fixed location. As a result, accelerometers are primarily used for simple motion sensing applications in consumer devices such as changing the screen of a mobile device from portrait to landscape orientation. The early generation Apple iPhone and Nintendo Wii incorporated accelerometers.
