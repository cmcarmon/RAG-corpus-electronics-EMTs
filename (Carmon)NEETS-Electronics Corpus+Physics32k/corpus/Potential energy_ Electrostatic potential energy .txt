where r is the position vector from Q to q and ε0 is the vacuum permittivity. This may also be written using Coulomb's constant ke = 1 ⁄ 4πε0.
If the electric charge of an object can be assumed to be at rest, then it has potential energy due to its position relative to other charged objects. The electrostatic potential energy is the energy of an electrically charged particle (at rest) in an electric field. It is defined as the work that must be done to move it from an infinite distance away to its present location, adjusted for non-electrical forces on the object. This energy will generally be non-zero if there is another electrically charged object nearby.
The work W required to move q from A to any point B in the electrostatic force field is given by the potential function

A related quantity called electric potential (commonly denoted with a V for voltage) is equal to the electric potential energy per unit charge.
