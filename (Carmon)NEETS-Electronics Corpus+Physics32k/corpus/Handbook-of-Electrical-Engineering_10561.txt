Point-by-Point Method.
Although currently light computations emphasize the zonal cavity method, there is
still considerable merit in the point-by-point method. This method lends itself especially well to calculating
the illumination level at a particular point where total illumination is the sum of general overhead lighting and
 curves must
supplementary lighting. In this method, information from luminaire 
be  applied  to  the  mathematical  relationship.  The  total  contribution  from  all  luminaires  to  the  illumination
level on the task plane must be summed.
