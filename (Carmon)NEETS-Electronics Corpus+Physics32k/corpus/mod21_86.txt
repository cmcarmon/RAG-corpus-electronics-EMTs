Capacitors incur various losses as a result of such factors as resistance in the conductors (plates) or
leads, current leakage, and dielectric absorption, all of which affect the power factor of the capacitor.
Theoretically, the power factor of an ideal capacitor should be zero; however, the losses listed above
cause the power factors of practical capacitors to range from near 0 to a possible 100%. The average
power factor for good capacitors, excluding electrolytics, is 2% to 3%. Current leakage, which is an
inverse function of frequency, is important only at the lower frequencies and becomes negligible at higher
frequencies. Dielectric absorption (sometimes referred to as dielectric viscosity) results in losses that
produce heat. The effect of this type of loss is the same as resistance in series with the capacitor.
