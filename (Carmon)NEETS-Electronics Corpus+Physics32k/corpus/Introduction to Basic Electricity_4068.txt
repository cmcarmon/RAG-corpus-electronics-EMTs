After completing this chapter, the student 
will be able to:
Identify ways in which waveform shapes can be 
changed.
Explain the frequency-domain concept in 
waveform construction.
Define pulse width, duty cycle, rise time, fall 
time, undershoot, overshoot, and ringing as they 
relate to waveforms.
Explain how differentiators and integrators 
work.
Describe clipper and clamper circuits.
Describe the differences between monostable 
and bistable multivibrators.
Draw schematic diagrams of waveshaping 
circuits.
