Light is one kind of electromagnetic energy. There are many other types, including heat energy and
radio energy. The only difference between the various types of electromagnetic energy is the frequency of
their waves (rate of vibration). The term SPECTRUM is used to designate the entire range of
electromagnetic waves arranged in order of their frequencies. The VISIBLE SPECTRUM contains only
those waves which stimulate the sense of sight. You, as a technician, might be expected to maintain
equipment that uses electromagnetic waves within, above, and below the visible spectrum.
