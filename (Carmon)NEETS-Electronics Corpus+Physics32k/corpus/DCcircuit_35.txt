However, electrons have signiÔ¨Åcantly more freedom to move around in an atom than either
protons or neutrons. In fact, they can be knocked out of their respective positions (even leaving
the atom entirely!) by far less energy than what it takes to dislodge particles in the nucleus. If
this happens, the atom still retains its chemical identity, but an important imbalance occurs.
Electrons and protons are unique in the fact that they are attracted to one another over a
distance. It is this attraction over distance which causes the attraction between rubbed objects,
where electrons are moved away from their original atoms to reside around atoms of another
object.
