The ﬁrst and foremost requirement for bus protection is the
speed of relay operation. There are several important reasons
for that all relate to the fact that the fault currents are pretty
high. First, the current transformers used to measure the
currents may get saturated; hence, a fast operation will allow
for the relaying decision to be made before this happens. Next,
due to the high currents, the equipment damage caused by a
sustained fault may be pretty severe. Hence, the need to ac-
complish an isolation of the faulted bus from the rest of the
system in the shortest time possible is paramount. Last, but
not least, due to the various possibilities in reconﬁguring
busses, it is very important that the bus protection scheme is
developed and implemented in a ﬂexible way. It needs to allow
for various parts of the bus to be isolated for maintenance
purposes related to the breakers on the connected lines, and yet
the protection for the rest of the bus needs to stay intact.
