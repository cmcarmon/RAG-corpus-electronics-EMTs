Charging Circuit
In  order  for  a  deﬁbrillation  shock  to  occur,  it  is  necessary  to  convert  the  6 V  from  the  battery  to  an  output
voltage of up to 750 V to be stored across a capacitor. This is generally done with a dc/dc converter, or inverter.
Unique  design  considerations  include  the  large  size  of  the  conversion,  a  demand  for  high  efﬁciency,  and  a
minimized transformer and circuit size. The circuit includes the battery and a low-voltage, high-current switch
at the input, a ﬂy-back transformer, and a rectifying diode and storage capacitor at the output. A controlling
oscillator typically operates the switch between 30 and 60 kHz for high efﬁciency [Warren et al., 1996]. This
creates a simulated ac current, which is converted by the transformer to the higher voltage. The current in the
input stage is, typically, around 2 A. The rectiﬁer diode prevents current from ﬂowing back into the secondary
winding of the transformer. The voltage on the capacitor increases as a function of the square root of the time
that the oscillator is on and typically reaches full capacity in 10 to 15 seconds [Warren et al., 1996]. It is possible
for the transformer to be small because of the high-speed switching. In addition, the diameter of the core and
the wire windings in the ﬂy-back transformer can be small because the converter is only used intermittently
to  charge  the  capacitor,  which  allows  for  ease  of  heat  dissipation  compared  to  continuous  conversion  [Bach
and Monroe, 1996]. There is a trade-off between the size of the converter and the efﬁciency. The high clock
rates  allow  the  transformer  to  be  small,  but  also  introduce  losses  in  energy  due  to  hysteresis  in  the  coils. A
typical ICD charging circuit achieves about 75% efﬁciency [Bach and Monroe, 1996]. This plays a major role
in the charging time and, therefore, the delay before shocking therapy can be delivered.
