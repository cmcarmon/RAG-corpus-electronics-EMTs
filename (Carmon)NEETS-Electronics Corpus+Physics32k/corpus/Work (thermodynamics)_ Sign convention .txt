Classically, a negative value of work indicates that a positive amount of work done by the system leads to energy being lost from the system. This sign convention has historically been used in many physics textbooks and will be used in the present article.
According to the first law of thermodynamics for a closed system, any net increase in the internal energy U must be fully accounted for, in terms of heat δQ entering the system and the work δW done by the system:




d
U
=
δ
Q
−
δ
W
.



{\displaystyle dU=\delta Q-\delta W.\;}

An alternate sign convention is to consider the work performed on the system by its surroundings as positive. This leads to a change in sign of the work, so that



d
U
=
δ
Q
+
δ
W



{\displaystyle dU=\delta Q+\delta W\,}
. This convention has historically been used in chemistry, but has been adopted in several modern physics textbooks.
In the above, the letter d indicates an exact differential, expressing that internal energy U is a property of the state of the system; they depend only on the original state and the final state, and not upon the path taken. In contrast, the Greek deltas (δ's) in this equation reflect the fact that the heat transfer and the work transfer are not properties of the final state of the system. Given only the initial state and the final state of the system, one can only say what the total change in internal energy was, not how much of the energy went out as heat, and how much as work. This can be summarized by saying that heat and work are not state functions of the system. This is in contrast to classical mechanics, where net work exerted by a particle is a state function.
