Here,  IES  is  an  extremely  small  leakage  current  internal  to  the  transistor,  q  is  the  electronic  charge,  k  is
Boltzmannâ€™s  constant,  and  T  is  the  absolute  temperature  in  kelvins.  Usually,  kT/q  is  called  VT  and  is  about
26 mV  at  a  room  temperature  of  25(cid:176)C.  This  implies  that  for  any  value  of  VBE  over  about  100  mV,  then
exp(VBE /VT) >> 1, and for all normal operating conditions, Eq. (24.3) reduces to
