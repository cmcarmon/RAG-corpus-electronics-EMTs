. When the 
transistor  is  turned  on,  the  base-emitter  voltage  is  constrained  by  the  diode,  while  the 
collector-emitter voltage can vary because the current source will produce the necessary 
voltage to draw the desired amount of current. In practice, however, the collector-emitter 
voltage must be greater than a few hundred milli-volts to avoid forward-biasing of the 
base-collector diode.
