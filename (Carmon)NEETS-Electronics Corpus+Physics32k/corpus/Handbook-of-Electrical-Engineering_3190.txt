3. The  full-bridge  conÔ¨Åguration  (Fig. 30.27)  requires  only  one  smoothing  capacitor,  and  for  the  same
transistor type as that of half-bridge, output power can be doubled. It is usually used for power levels
above 1 kW, and the design is more costly due to increased number of components (uses four transistors
compared to two in push-pull and half-bridge converters).
