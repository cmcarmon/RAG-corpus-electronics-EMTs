View (B) of figure 3-9 shows the waveforms associated with the circuit. At time T1, Q2 comes out 
of cutoff and goes into saturation. Also, Q1 is caused to come out of saturation and is cut off. The base 
voltage waveform of Q1 shows a positive potential that is holding Q1 at cutoff. This voltage would 
normally hold Q1 at cutoff until a point between T2 and T3. However, at time T2 another trigger is 
applied to the base of Q1, causing it to begin conducting. Q1 goes into saturation and Q2 is caused to cut 
off. This action repeats each time a trigger (T2, T4, T6) is applied.
