If you supply a DC voltage to a circuit containing a capacitor in series with a 
light bulb (as shown in Figure 7‐2), current flow cannot be sustained because 
there’s no complete conductive path across the plates. In other words, 
capacitors block DC current. However, electrons do move around this little 
circuit — temporarily — in an interesting way.
