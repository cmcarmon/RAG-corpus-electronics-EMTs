The Truchet point, the first modern typographic point, was 1/144 of a French inch or 1/1728 of the royal foot. It was invented by the French clergyman Sébastien Truchet. During the metrication of France amid its revolution, a 1799 law declared the meter to be exactly 443.296 French lines long. This established a length to the royal foot of 9000/27706 m or about 325 mm, which made the Truchet point equal to 15625/83118 mm or about 0.187986 mm, although it has also been cited as exactly 0.188 mm.
The Fournier point was established by Pierre Simon Fournier in 1737 The system of Fournier was also based on the royal foot (pied-du-roi) of his time, 1 foot equals 12 inches, 1 inch (pouce) was divided into 12 lines (lignes) and 1 line was further divided into 6 typographic points (points typographiques). That is one point of Fournier was twice larger than one point of Truchet.

For the reference Fournier gave a roughly printed scale of 144 points (or two inches). However, the scale was too imprecise that it was actually impossible to measure a single point with it.
The Didot point, established by François-Ambroise Didot in 1783, was an attempt to improve the Fournier system. He did not change the subdivisions (1 inch = 12 lines = 72 points), but strictly selected the royal foot as the authorized measure. Thus the Didot point is exactly 1/864 of a French foot or 1/72 of a French inch, that is (by 1799) 15625/41559 mm or about 0.375972 mm.
While in theory both the points must have been equal, in practice 12 points of Fournier turned to be 11 points of Didot. That gives the Fournier point the size of about 0.345 mm; later sources state it as being 0.34875 mm. To avoid confusion between the new and the old sizes, Didot also rejected the traditional names, thus parisienne became corps 5, nompareille became corps 6, and so on.
The Fournier point did not achieve lasting popularity despite being revived by the Monotype Corporation in 1927. It was still a standard in Belgium, in parts of Austria, and in Northern France at the beginning of the 20th century.
Approximations were subsequently employed, largely owing to the Didot point's unwieldy conversion to metric units (the divisor of its conversion ratio has the prime factorization of 3×7×1979).
In 1878 Hermann Berthold defined that 798 points equal 30 cm or 2660 points equal 1 meter: that gives around 0.376 mm to the point. A more precise number,0.376065 mm, sometimes is given; this is used by TeX as the dd unit. This has become the standard in Germany and Central and Eastern Europe. This size is still mentioned in the technical regulations of the Eurasian Economic Union.
TeX also supports a new Didot point (nd) at 3/8mm or 0.375 mm and cites a 1978 redefinition for it. The French National Print Office adopted a point of 2/5mm or 0.400 mm in about 1810 and continues to use this measurement today (though "recalibrated" to 0.39877 mm).
Japanese and German standardization bodies instead opted for a metric typographic base measure of exactly 1/4mm or 0.250 mm. It is called Q in Japanese after the initial letter of quarter millimeter. Due to demand by Japanese typesetters, CSS adopted Q in 2015.
