The Gantt chart is a timeline chart that clearly 
shows when each task is to begin, the amount of time 
necessary to complete each task, and those tasks that 
will be going on at the same time. There can be more 
than one level of Gantt charts. For example, one chart 
could display the overall production phase from be-
ginning to end; another chart could focus on activities 
for a short period of time; and another chart might 
show a task for a specific week. Figure 47-11 shows a 
two-week chart.
