In astrodynamics and celestial dynamics, the orbital state vectors (sometimes state vectors) of an orbit are cartesian vectors of position (




r



{\displaystyle \mathbf {r} }
) and velocity (




v



{\displaystyle \mathbf {v} }
) that together with their time (epoch) (



t



{\displaystyle t\,}
) uniquely determine the trajectory of the orbiting body in space.
