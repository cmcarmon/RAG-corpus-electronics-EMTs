The COLLECTOR-INJECTION MODULATOR is the transistor equivalent of the electron-tube AM 
plate modulator. This transistor modulator can be used for low-level or relatively high-level modulation. 
It is referred to as relatively high-level modulation because, at the present time, transistors are limited in 
their power-handling capability. As illustrated in figure 1-47, the circuit design for a transistor collector-
injection modulator is very similar to that of a plate modulator. The collector-injection modulator is 
capable of 100-percent modulation with medium power-handling capabilities.
