One of the reasons transistors are so popular for switching is that they donâ€™t 
dissipate a lot of power. Remember that power is the product of current and 
voltage. When a transistor is off, no current flows, so the power dissipated is 
zero. When a transistor is fully on, VCE is nearly zero, so the power dissipated 
is nearly zero.
