Power supply noise is the difference between the local voltage
references of the driver and the receiver. The increased amount
of current on power supply lines causes a raise in IR drop on
voltage references. This makes the gate have higher sensibility
to noise spikes. This low frequency component (IR drop) is
managed well by ï¬‚ip-chip C4 packaging, which provides a very
low resistance current path. Besides, the higher speed tran-
sients allowed by scaled transistor sizes are associated to higher
L di/dt due to the large inductances of the package and on-
chip. Furthermore, the decoupling capacitance of the circuit is
decreased due to the reduced sizes of the gates. Power supply
noise is a dominant factor in the design of wide domino
circuits and in circuits using contention where the alternating
current (ac) logic level is shifted with respect to power supply
rails. To counter these problems in high-speed designs, several
physical design techniques have been proposed: (1) sizing up
the P/G lines to accommodate the large current peaks and to
minimize the IR and L di/dt voltage variations in these lines
(Su et al., 2000), (2) increasing the number of P/G pins, and
(3) deploying decoupling capacitors in the P/G lines (Bakoglu,
1990; Zhao et al., 2001). In addition, a designer could perform
clock skew scheduling to minimize the number of simulta-
neous switching (Lam et al., 2002). He or she could also use
copper in place of aluminum to overcome the increased resis-
tance of scaled interconnect.
