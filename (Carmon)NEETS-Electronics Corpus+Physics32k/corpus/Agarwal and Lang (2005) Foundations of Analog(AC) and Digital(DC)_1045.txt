Our output operating point of 5.1 V falls in the center of this range, and so the output
swing is symmetric about the 5.1 V operating point. The symmetry results directly from
the linearity of the BJT in its active region. Contrast this result with that for the MOSFET
(Section 7.7), in which the output swing was asymmetric due to the MOSFETâ€™s nonlinear
behavior in its saturation region.
