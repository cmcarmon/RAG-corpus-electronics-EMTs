Choosing the right dielectric for the job
Designers of electronic circuitry specify capacitors for a project by the dielec-
tric material in them. Some materials are better in certain applications and 
are inappropriate for other applications. For instance, electrolytic capacitors 
can handle large currents but perform reliably only for signal frequencies of 
less than 100 kHz, so they are commonly used in audio amplifiers and power 
supply circuits. Mica capacitors, however, exhibit exceptional frequency char-
acteristics and are often used in radio frequency (RF) transmitter circuits.
