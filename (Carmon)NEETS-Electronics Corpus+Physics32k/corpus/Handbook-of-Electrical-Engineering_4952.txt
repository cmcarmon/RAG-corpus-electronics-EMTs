 is the thermal time constant of
T
 is the electrical resistance across the element,
G
is the emissivity of the element for the radiation being detected, and 
 is the sensitive area of the element.
It is easy to show that the response of a pyroelectric device maximizes at a frequency equal to the inverse of
and
the geometric mean of the two time constants and that above and below the two frequencies given by 
t
. The consequence of this is that pyroelectric detectors have their sensitivities maximized by
E
having fairly long electrical time constants (0.1 to 10 s) and that such detectors thus work best at low frequencies
(0.1 to 100 Hz). However, if high sensitivity is not required, extremely large bandwidths with little sensitivity
  high). In this
variation can be obtained by shortening these time constants (making 
T
way, detectors have been made which give picosecond time responses for tracking fast laser pulses.
