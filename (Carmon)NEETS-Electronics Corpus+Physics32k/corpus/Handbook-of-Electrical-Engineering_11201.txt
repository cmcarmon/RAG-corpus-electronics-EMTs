In addition to the information available from spontaneous electrical activity of the EEG, the brain’s electrical
response to sensory stimulation can contribute data as to the status of cortical and subcortical regions activated
by  sensory  input.  Due  to  the  relatively  small  amplitude  of  a  stimulus-evoked  potential  as  compared  to  the
spontaneous EEG potentials, the technique of signal averaging is used to enhance the stimulus-evoked response.
Stimulus averaging takes advantage of the fact that the brain’s electrical response is time-locked to the onset
of the stimulus and the nonevoked background potentials are randomly distributed in time. Consequently, the
average  of  multiple  stimulus  responses  will  result  in  the  enhancement  of  the  time-locked  activity,  while  the
averaged random background activity will approach zero. The result is an evoked response that consists of a
number of discrete and replicable peaks that occur, depending upon the stimulus and the recording parameters,
at predicted latencies from the onset of stimulation. The spatial localization of maximum peak amplitudes has
been associated with cortical generators in primary sensory cortex.
