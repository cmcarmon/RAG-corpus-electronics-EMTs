Advances are still being made in the ﬁeld of pH measurement, some of which hold great
promise for overcoming traditional limitations of pH electrodes. One such technology uses a
device called a ﬁeld-effect transistor to electrostatically measure the voltage produced by an
ion-permeable membrane rather than measure the voltage with an actual voltmeter circuit.
While this technology harbors limitations of its own, it is at least a pioneering concept, and
may prove more practical at a later date.
