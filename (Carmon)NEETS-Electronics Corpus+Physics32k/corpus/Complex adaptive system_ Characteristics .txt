Some of the most important characteristics of complex systems are:
The number of elements is sufficiently large that conventional descriptions (e.g. a system of differential equations) are not only impractical, but cease to assist in understanding the system. Moreover, the elements interact dynamically, and the interactions can be physical or involve the exchange of information
Such interactions are rich, i.e. any element or sub-system in the system is affected by and affects several other elements or sub-systems
The interactions are non-linear: small changes in inputs, physical interactions or stimuli can cause large effects or very significant changes in outputs
Interactions are primarily but not exclusively with immediate neighbours and the nature of the influence is modulated
Any interaction can feed back onto itself directly or after a number of intervening stages. Such feedback can vary in quality. This is known as recurrency
The overall behavior of the system of elements is not predicted by the behavior of the individual elements
Such systems may be open and it may be difficult or impossible to define system boundaries
Complex systems operate under far from equilibrium conditions. There has to be a constant flow of energy to maintain the organization of the system
Complex systems have a history. They evolve and their past is co-responsible for their present behaviour
Elements in the system may be ignorant of the behaviour of the system as a whole, responding only to the information or physical stimuli available to them locally
Robert Axelrod & Michael D. Cohen identify a series of key terms from a modeling perspective:
Strategy, a conditional action pattern that indicates what to do in which circumstances
Artifact, a material resource that has definite location and can respond to the action of agents
Agent, a collection of properties, strategies & capabilities for interacting with artifacts & other agents
Population, a collection of agents, or, in some situations, collections of strategies
System, a larger collection, including one or more populations of agents and possibly also artifacts
Type, all the agents (or strategies) in a population that have some characteristic in common
Variety, the diversity of types within a population or system
Interaction pattern, the recurring regularities of contact among types within a system
Space (physical), location in geographical space & time of agents and artifacts
Space (conceptual), "location" in a set of categories structured so that "nearby" agents will tend to interact
Selection, processes that lead to an increase or decrease in the frequency of various types of agent or strategies
Success criteria or performance measures, a "score" used by an agent or designer in attributing credit in the selection of relatively successful (or unsuccessful) strategies or agents
