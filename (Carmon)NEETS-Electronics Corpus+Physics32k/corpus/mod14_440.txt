At CP4, FF2 and FF4 reset, and FF3 sets. FF1 remains reset because of the HIGH at the K input. The
output of AND gate 2 goes LOW because the output of FF4 is LOW and the third digit of the number is
output on the serial line. CP5 causes FF4 to set and FF3 to reset. CP5 and the HIGH from FF4 cause
AND gate 2 to output the last digit of the number on the serial line. It took a total of four CLK pulses to
input the number in parallel and output it in serial.
