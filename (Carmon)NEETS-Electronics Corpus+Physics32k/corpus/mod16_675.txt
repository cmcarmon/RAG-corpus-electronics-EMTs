The basic dual-trace oscilloscope has one gun assembly and two vertical channels. However, there
are many variations. The horizontal sweep channels vary somewhat from equipment to equipment. Some
have one time-base circuit and others have two. These two are interdependent in some oscilloscopes and
in others they are independently controlled. Also, most modern general-purpose oscilloscopes are
constructed of modules. That is, most of the vertical circuitry is contained in a removable plug-in unit,
and most of the horizontal circuitry is contained in another plug-in unit.
