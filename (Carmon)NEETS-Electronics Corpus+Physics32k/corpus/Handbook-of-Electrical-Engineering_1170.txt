Example 1. 
In digital signal processing, the two most commonly employed metric spaces correspond to the
set of all real-valued n · 1 vectors as designated by Rn and the set of all real-valued m · n matrices as designated
by Rm ·  n. The elements of a vector contained in Rn typically correspond to samples made of a one-dimensional
signal.  On  the  other  hand,  the  elements  of  a  matrix  contained  in  Rm ·  n might  correspond  to  the  brightness
levels  of  the  pixels  in  a  rectangular  image  or  the  entries  of  a  data  matrix  formed  from  samples  of  a  one-
dimensional signal. It often happens in engineering applications that the data under analysis is complex valued.
To treat such cases, we will have need to consider the set of all complex-valued n ·  1 tuples as designated by
Cn and the set of all complex-valued m · n matrices as denoted by Cm · n .
