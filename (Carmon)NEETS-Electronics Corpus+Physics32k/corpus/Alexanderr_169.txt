We  say  that  a  resistor  is  a  linear  element  because  the  voltage-current
relationship satisﬁes both the homogeneity and the additivity properties.
In  general,  a  circuit  is  linear  if  it  is  both  additive  and  homoge-
neous. A linear circuit consists of only linear elements, linear depend-
ent sources, and independent sources.
