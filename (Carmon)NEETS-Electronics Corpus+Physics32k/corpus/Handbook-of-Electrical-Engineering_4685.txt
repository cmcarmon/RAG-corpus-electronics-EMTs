The most common SAW UDTs are called the three-phase UDT (3PUDT) and the group type UDT (GUDT).
The 3PUDT has the broadest bandwidth and requires multilevel metal structures with crossovers. The GUDT
uses a single-level metal but has a narrower unidirectional bandwidth due to its structure. In addition, there
are  other  UDT  or  equivalent  embodiments  which  can  be  implemented  but  will  not  be  discussed  [Morgan,
1985].  The  basic  structure  of  a  3PUDT  is  shown  in  Fig. 47.8.  A  unit  cell  consists  of  three  electrodes,  each
connected to a separate bus bar, where the electrode period is l0/3. One bus bar is grounded and the other two
bus bars will be driven by an electrical network where V1 = V2 — 60(cid:176). The transducer analysis can be accom-
plished similar to a simple IDT by considering the 3PUDT as three collinear IDTs with a spatial phase shift, as
shown  in  Fig. 47.8.  The  electrical  phasing  network,  typically  consisting  of  one  or  two  reactive  elements,  in
conjunction  with  the  spatial  offset  results  in  energy  being  launched  in  only  one  direction  from  the  SAW
transducer. The transducer can then be matched to the required load impedance with one or two additional
reactive elements. The effective unidirectional bandwidth of the 3PUDT is typically 20% or less, beyond which
the  transducer  behaves  as  a  normal  bidirectional  transducer.  Figure  47.9  shows  a  3PUDT  ﬁlter  schematic
consisting of two transducers and their associated matching and phasing networks. The overall ﬁlter must be
analyzed with all external electrical components in place for accurate prediction of performance. The external
components  can  be  miniaturized  and  may  be  fabricated  using  only  printed  circuit  board  material  and  area.
This type of device has demonstrated as low as 2 dB insertion loss.
