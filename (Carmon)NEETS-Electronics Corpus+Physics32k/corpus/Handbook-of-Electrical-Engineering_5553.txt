A  fault in  an  electrical  power  system  is  the  unintentional  and  undesirable  creation  of  a  conducting  path  (a
short circuit) or a blockage of current (an open circuit). The short-circuit fault is typically the most common
and is usually implied when most people use the term fault. We restrict our comments to the short-circuit fault.
The causes of faults include lightning, wind damage, trees falling across lines, vehicles colliding with towers
or  poles,  birds  shorting  out  lines,  aircraft  colliding  with  lines,  vandalism,  small  animals  entering  switchgear,
and line breaks due to excessive ice loading. Power system faults may be categorized as one of four types: single
line-to-ground, line-to-line, double line-to-ground, and balanced three-phase. The Ô¨Årst three types constitute
severe unbalanced operating conditions.
