Intelligent Network Systems
In 1981, AT&T introduced into the Bell System a set of centralized databases called network control points;
they  supported  two  applications—the  Billing  Validation  Application  for  Calling  Card  Service  (credit  card
calling)  and  the  INWATS  database  used  to  support  800  Service.  Queries  were  launched  to  these  databases
through AT&T’s common-channel interofﬁce signaling (CCIS) network.
