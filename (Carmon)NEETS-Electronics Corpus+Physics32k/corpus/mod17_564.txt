The components used in bands of medium frequency and below are much larger physically than the 
ones previously discussed. This is because of the higher operating voltage and current levels required to 
produce the very high-powered rf outputs needed for the uses covered in chapter 1. A given resistor used 
in an hf application may be rated at 1/2 watt, whereas the same resistor used in a lower frequency 
application would probably be rated in tens or even hundreds of watts.
