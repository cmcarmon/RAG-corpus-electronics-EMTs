Controlling timing cycles
You can also put a resistor to work with another popular component — a 
capacitor, which I discuss in Chapter 7 — to create predictable up and 
down voltage swings. You’ll find the resistor‐capacitor combo helps you 
create a kind of hourglass timer, which comes in handy for circuits that have 
time dependencies (for instance, a three‐way traffic light). I show how the 
dynamic duo of resistor and capacitor operates in Chapter 7.
