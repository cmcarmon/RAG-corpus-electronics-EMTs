Examples of inorganic PC materials include amorphous chalcogenide alloys such as a-Se, a-As2Se3 and Te-
doped Se. Most do not have a high sensitivity at GaAlAs wavelength, but a-Si does. a-Si also offers other desirable
properties (e.g., durability and lack of fatigue), but is quite expensive to produce.
