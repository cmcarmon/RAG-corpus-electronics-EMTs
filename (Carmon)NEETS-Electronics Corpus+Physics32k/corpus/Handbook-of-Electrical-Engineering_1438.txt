In the ﬁrst level of processing, abbreviations such as “Dr.” (which could mean “doctor” or “drive”), numbers
(“1492”  could  be  a  year  or  a  quantity),  special  symbols  such  as “$”,  upper  case  acronyms  (e.g.,  NASA),  and
nonspoken  symbols  such  as  “’”  (apostrophe)  are  converted  to  a  standard  form.  Next  preﬁxes  and  perhaps
sufﬁxes are removed from the body of words prior to searching for the root word in a lexicon, which deﬁnes
the phonetic representation for the word. The lexicon includes words which do not obey the normal rules of
pronunciation, such as “of ”. If the word is not contained in the lexicon, it is processed by an algorithm which
contains a large set of rules of pronunciation.
