The basic idea of high-redundancy actuation is technology agnostic: it should be applicable to a wide range of actuator technology, including different kinds of linear actuators and rotational actuators.
However, initial experiments are performed with electric actuators, especially with electromechanical and electromagnetic technology. Compared to pneumatic actuators, the electrical drive allow a much finer control of position and force.
