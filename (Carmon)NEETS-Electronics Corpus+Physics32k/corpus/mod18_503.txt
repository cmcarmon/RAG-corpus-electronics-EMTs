Automatic bus transfer (ABT) equipment is used to provide power to vital loads, while nonvital 
loads can be fed through manual bus transfer (MBT) equipment. For example, the interior 
communications (IC) switchboard is fed through an ABT in which the alternate input is from the 
emergency switchboard. A search radar might be fed through an MBT.
