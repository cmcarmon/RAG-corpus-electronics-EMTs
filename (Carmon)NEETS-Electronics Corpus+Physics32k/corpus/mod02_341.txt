HENRY (H)—The electromagnetic unit of inductance or mutual inductance. The inductance of a circuit
is 1 henry when a current variation of 1 ampere per second induces 1 volt. It is the basic unit of
inductance. In radio, smaller units are used such as the millihenry (mH), which is one-thousandth of
