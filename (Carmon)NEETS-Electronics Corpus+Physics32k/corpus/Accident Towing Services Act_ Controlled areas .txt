The strictest controls in the Accident Towing Services Act affect the capacity of accident tow trucks to operate in particular areas apply in relation to "controlled areas", basically most of the areas of the cities of Melbourne and Geelong where behavioural problems in the industry have been greatest in the past.
VicRoads is given power under the Act to declare controlled areas for the purposes of the Act and to appoint a person or body to act as the allocation body for those areas. A licence holder and driver commits an offence if the persons attend an accident scene in a controlled area or tow or attempt to tow a damaged vehicle unless the allocation body has authorised attendance at the accident scene and the towing activity. Each accident tow truck licence entitles the holder of the licence to one place on the roster if a specified depot is attached to the licence. A roster entitlement is not able to be transferred to another operator.
