Further work 
 
Connect a digital multimeter on the 20 V d.c. range 
so that you can accurately measure the d.c. voltage  
that  appears  between  pin-6  (threshold  input)  and  
0 V.  With  C = 100  µF  and  R = 1 MG press  the 
‘start’ button and then measure the voltage at pin-6  
at  intervals  of  10  s  over  the  range  0  to  120  s. 
Particularly note the voltage  reached at the end of 
the  monostable  timing  period  (this  should  be 
exactly 2/3 of the supply voltage). Plot a graph of 
voltage  against  time  and  justify  the  shape  of  this 
graph.
