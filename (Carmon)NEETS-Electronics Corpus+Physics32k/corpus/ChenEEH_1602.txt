To retrieve relevant cases, one technique is to assign indexes
(or labels) to all cases. Indexes represent an interpretation of a
situation and determine under what conditions a case can be
used to make useful inferences (Kolodner, 1993). Assigning
indexes is problem dependent, requiring a good understanding
of the problem domain. Another technique is to compute the
relevance of a case based on similarity measures. For example,
in nearest-neighbor matching, each corresponding feature of a
new case and a retrieved case is compared by looking at the
Ô¨Åeld type and values. Each feature gets a similarity score, and
the weighted sum of the feature scores is the overall similarity
score of the two cases.
