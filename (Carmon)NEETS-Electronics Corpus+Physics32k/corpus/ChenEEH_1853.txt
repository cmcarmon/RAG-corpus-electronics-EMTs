The H.225 RAS (registration, admission, and status) is
mainly used by H.323 endpoints (terminals and gateways) to
discover a gatekeeper, to register/unregister with the gate-
keeper, to request call admission and bandwidth allocation,
and to clear a call. The gatekeeper can also use this protocol for
inquiring on an endpoint and for communicating with other
peer gateways.
