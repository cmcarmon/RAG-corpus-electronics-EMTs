The development of radar into the highly complex systems in use today represents the accumulated
developments of many people and nations. The general principles of radar have been known for a long
time, but many electronics discoveries were necessary before a useful radar system could be developed.
World War II provided a strong incentive to develop practical radar, and early versions were in use soon
after the war began. Radar technology has improved in the years since the war. We now have radar
systems that are smaller, more efficient, and better than those early versions.
