The blocked-grid keying method in view (B) affords a complete cutoff of plate current. It is one of 
the best methods for keying amplifier stages in transmitters. In the voltage divider with the key open, two-
thirds of 1,000 volts, or 667 volts, is developed across the 200-kilohm resistor; one-third of 1,000 volts, or 
333 volts, is developed across the 100-kilohm resistor. The grid bias is the sum of 100 volts and 333 
volts, or 433 volts. This sum is below cutoff and no plate current flows. The plate voltage is 667 volts. 
With the key closed, the 200-kilohm resistor drops 1,000 volts. The plate voltage becomes 1,000 volts at 
the same time the grid bias becomes 100 volts. Grid bias is reduced enough so that the triode amplifier 
will conduct only on the peaks of the drive signal.
