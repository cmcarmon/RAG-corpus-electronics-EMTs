In 1958, Leo Esaki, a Japanese scientist, discovered that if a semiconductor junction diode is heavily 
doped with impurities, it will have a region of negative resistance. The normal junction diode uses 
semiconductor materials that are lightly doped with one impurity atom for ten-million semiconductor 
atoms. This low doping level results in a relatively wide depletion region. Conduction occurs in the 
normal junction diode only if the voltage applied to it is large enough to overcome the potential barrier of 
the junction.
