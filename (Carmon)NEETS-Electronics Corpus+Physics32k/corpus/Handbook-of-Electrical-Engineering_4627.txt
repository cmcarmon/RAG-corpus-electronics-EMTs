 will be a function of frequency and the orientation of the transducer with respect to the wave
In general, 
  is  proportional  to  the

directivity of the transducer. It is usually desirable for a microphone or hydrophone to have a ﬂat (i.e., frequency
independent) free-ﬁeld voltage sensitivity over the broadest possible range of frequencies to assure ﬁdelity of
the output electrical signal.
