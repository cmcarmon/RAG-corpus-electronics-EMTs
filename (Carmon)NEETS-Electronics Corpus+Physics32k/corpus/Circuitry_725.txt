Logic circuit faults 
 
Whilst  multimeters  can  be  used  for  checking  the 
voltages  present  on  the  supply  rails  within  digital 
logic  circuits  they  are  generally  unsuitable  for 
measuring  the  logic  states  of  the  points  or  nodes 
within a circuit. There are several reasons for this, 
including  the  fact  that  logic  states  are  represented 
by  voltage  levels  that  vary  according  to  the 
integrated  circuit  technology  employed.  However 
the  principal  reason  for  misleading  indications  is 
that the logic levels can be rapidly changing or may 
take  the  form  of  short  duration  pulses  that  simply 
cannot  be  detected  by  a  conventional  voltage 
measuring instrument. That said, where logic levels
