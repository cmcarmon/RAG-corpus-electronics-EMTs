C. Mapping of Logical Function into Physical Blocks: Next, the logical functions, e.g., A(s), B(s), …, E(s) in
Fig. 25.25(a), are converted into physical circuit blocks, e.g., blocks A(b), B(b), …, E(b) in Fig. 25.25(b).
Each physical block represents a logic function as a set of interconnected gates. Although details of the
physical layout are not known at this point, the estimated area and aspect ratio (ratio of height to width)
of each circuit block is needed to organize these blocks within the area of the IC.
