3An optimum noncoherent MFSK detector consists of a bank of energy detectors each matched to one of the M frequencies
in the MFSK set. In terms of this structure, the notion of orthogonality implies that for a given transmitted frequency there
will be no crosstalk (energy spillover) in any of the other M-1 energy detectors.
