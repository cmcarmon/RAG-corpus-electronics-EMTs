Code From Control-Flow Diagrams
Control-ﬂow diagrams are processed in a similar manner to signal-ﬂow diagrams. The main difference is that
while a signal ﬂow diagram uses a ﬁxed set of blocks with well-deﬁned semantics (the block interconnections
and block parameters being the only variants between two blocks of the same type), the blocks in control-ﬂow
diagrams  may  contain  arbitrary  expressions,  assignment  statements,  and/or  procedure  calls  (as  shown  in
Fig. 112.12). These BEACON language constructs must be translated into the primitives of each target language.
The BEACON graphical editor ensures that control-ﬂow diagrams are well structured, i.e., that the diagram
can be mapped into structured code. The automatic translation of large truth-tables into complex structured
code is particularly time-saving.
