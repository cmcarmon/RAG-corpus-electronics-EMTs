FIGURE  50.2 Transverse  strain  as  a  function  of  the  square  of  the  polarization  in  ceramic  0.9PMNâ€“0.1PT,  at  RT.  The
quadratic  (x  =  QP2)  nature  of  electrostriction  is  illustrated.  Shaded  circles  indicate  strain  measured  while  increasing
polarization and unshaded circles indicate decreasing polarization.
