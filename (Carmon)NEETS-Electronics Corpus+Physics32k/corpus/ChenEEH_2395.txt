The parameters of the polarization ellipse are expressed in the
following and are conditional upon the phase difference be-
tween ru and rf(arg(rf)-arg(ru) Â¼ Df. In the following, it is
assumed that -p=2  g  p=2, and a  b. It is also assumed
that one represents the phase difference, Df, in the domain
-p < Df  p.
