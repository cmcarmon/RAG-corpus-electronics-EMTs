lower layer. The lower the frequency of a radio wave, the more rapidly the wave is refracted by a given 
degree of ionization. Figure 2-16 shows three separate waves of different frequencies entering an 
ionospheric layer at the same angle. Notice that the 5-megahertz wave is refracted quite sharply. The 
20-megahertz wave is refracted less sharply and returned to Earth at a greater distance. The 
100-megahertz wave is obviously greater than the critical frequency for that ionized layer and, therefore, 
is not refracted but is passed into space.
