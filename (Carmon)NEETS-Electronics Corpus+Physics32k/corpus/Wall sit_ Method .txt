The participant should lean against the wall with their feet planted firmly on the ground, shoulder width apart. Their feet should also be about two feet away from the wall (though the optimal distance will be somewhat dependent on the participant's height).
Once in such a position, the participant should slowly slide down the wall with their back pressed against it until their legs are bent at a right angle. This angle is very crucial because if the thighs are not parallel to the ground, the quadriceps will be bearing less load and the effectiveness of the exercise will be diminished.
The participant's knees should also be directly above their ankles and their back should be touching the wall at all times.
Depending on the participant's strength, they should hold the position for 20 seconds to a minute (or longer for more advanced athletes). If performing multiple repetitions of the exercise (three is often a recommended number), the participant should rest for half a minute in between in order to allow their muscles to recuperate.
As the participant gains strength, they can increase their holding time by small increments such as 10 seconds. While a burning feeling in the quadriceps muscles is normal, if the participant feels even a little pain in their knee or kneecap, they should be advised to immediately stop the activity.
