We shall Ô¨Årst consider polyphase induction motors and then single-phase induction motors. The
polyphase induction motors used in industrial applications are almost without exception three-
phase. The stator winding is connected to the ac source, and the rotor winding is either short-
circuited, as in squirrel-cage machines, or closed through external resistances, as in wound-rotor
machines. The cage machines are also known as brushless machines; the wound-rotor machines
are also called slip-ring machines.
