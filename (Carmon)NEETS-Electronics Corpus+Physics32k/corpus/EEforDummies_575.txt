The diode in an LED is housed in a plastic bulb designed to focus the light 
in a particular direction. The lead connected to the cathode is shorter than 
the lead connected to the anode. Compared to standard incandescent light 
bulbs, LEDs are more durable and efficient, run cooler, achieve full bright­
ness much faster, and last much longer. LEDs are commonly used as indi­
cator lights, task lights, and holiday lights, and in automobile headlights, 
displays (such as alarm clocks), and high‐definition TVs.
