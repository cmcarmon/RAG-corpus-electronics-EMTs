constant line Pm with the curve Pmax sin u highlighted by the
black marks depict the two possible equilibrium points when
Pm < Pmax. Let us denote the equilibrium point between 0 and
p=2 by us and the other equilibrium between p=2 and p by uu.
We will show that the equilibrium (us, vs)T is small-signal
stable, while the other equilibrium (uu, vs)T is small-signal
unstable. For assessing the small-signal stability, we need to
evaluate the Jacobian matrix A at the respective equilibrium
point. The Jacobian is ﬁrst derived as:
