To review briefly, when a capacitor is connected across a voltage source, a surge of charging current
flows. This charging current develops a cemf across the capacitor which opposes the applied voltage. When
the capacitor is fully charged, the cemf is equal to the applied voltage and charging current ceases. At full
charge, the electrostatic field between the plates is at maximum intensity and the energy stored in the
dielectric is maximum. If the charged capacitor is disconnected from the source, the charge will be retained
for some period of time. The length of time the charge is retained depends on the amount of leakage current
present. Since electrical energy is stored in the capacitor, a charged capacitor can act as a source emf.
