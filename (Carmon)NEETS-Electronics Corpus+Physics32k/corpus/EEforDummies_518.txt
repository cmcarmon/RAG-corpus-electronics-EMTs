A quartz crystal is accurate to within roughly 0.001% of its stated resonant 
frequency. (That’s why they’re worth paying some extra bucks for!) You may 
also hear of ceramic resonators, which work the same way but cost less and 
are not as accurate as quartz. Ceramic resonators have a 0.5% frequency tol-
erance — meaning that the actual resonant frequency can vary by as much as 
0.5% above or below its stated resonant frequency — and are used in many 
consumer‐electronics devices, such as TVs, cameras, and toys.
