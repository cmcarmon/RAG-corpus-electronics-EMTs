If another cache contains a modiﬁed copy of this line, it is
possible that the two modiﬁcations are in different positions in
the line. It is therefore necessary for the initiating controller to
stall while the other cache controller writes its modiﬁed line
out to main memory before invalidating its line. If no cache
has a modiﬁed copy of this line, no signals are returned to the
initiating processor, which modiﬁes the line in its local cache,
marking it modiﬁed. If any other caches containing clean
copies of this line, their copies are marked invalid.
