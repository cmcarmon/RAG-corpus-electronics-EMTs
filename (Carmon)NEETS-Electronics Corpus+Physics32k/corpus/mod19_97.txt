â€¢ Do not cover a tourniquet with a dressing. If you must cover the injured person in some way, 
make sure that all other people concerned with the case know about the tourniquet. Using 
crayon, magic marker, or blood, mark a large T on the victim's forehead or on a medical tag 
attached to the wrist.
