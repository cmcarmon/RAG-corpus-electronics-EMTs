The standard solution to the flatness problem invokes cosmic inflation, a process whereby the universe expands exponentially quickly (i.e.



a


{\displaystyle a}
grows as

{\displaystyle e^{\lambda t}}
with time

, for some constant

) during a short period in its early history. The theory of inflation was first proposed in 1979, and published in 1981, by Alan Guth. His two main motivations for doing so were the flatness problem and the horizon problem, another fine-tuning problem of physical cosmology.
The proposed cause of inflation is a field which permeates space and drives the expansion. The field contains a certain energy density, but unlike the density of the matter or radiation present in the late universe, which decrease over time, the density of the inflationary field remains roughly constant as space expands. Therefore, the term

{\displaystyle \rho a^{2}}

must therefore decrease with time.
Thus if

as required above, for example. Subsequent evolution of the universe will cause the value to grow, bringing it to the currently observed value of around 0.01. Thus the sensitive dependence on the initial value of Ω has been removed: a large and therefore 'unsurprising' starting value need not become amplified and lead to a very curved universe with no opportunity to form galaxies and other structures.
This success in solving the flatness problem is considered one of the major motivations for inflationary theory.
