Returns from moving targets and clutter sources are offset from the radar carrier frequency by the associated
Doppler frequency. As a function of range rate, R·, the Doppler frequency, f D, is given by 2R· /l.  A coherent
pulse train samples the returns’ Doppler modulation at the PRF. Most radar systems employ parallel sampling
in  the  in-phase  and  quadrature  baseband  channels  so  that  the  effective  sampling  rate  is  twice  the  PRF.  The
target’s return is folded in frequency if the PRF is less than the target Doppler.
