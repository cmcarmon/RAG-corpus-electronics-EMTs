Two other types of decoder circuits are the 1-of-8 
(octal, or base-8) decoder and the 1-of-16 (hexadeci-
mal, or base-16) decoder (Figure 45-6). The 1-of-8 
decoder accepts a 3-bit input word and decodes it to 
one of eight possible outputs. The 1-of-16 decoder ac-
tivates 1 of 16 output lines by a 4-bit code word. It is 
also called a 4-line-to-16-line decoder.
