A laser is a device that produces optical radiation by the process of stimulated emission. It is
necessary to contain photons produced by stimulated emission within the laser active region. Figure 6-3
shows an optical cavity formed to contain the emitted photons by placing one reflecting mirror at each
end of an amplifying medium. One mirror is made partially reflecting so that some radiation can escape
from the cavity for coupling to an optical fiber.
