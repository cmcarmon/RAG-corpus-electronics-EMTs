EXAMPLE 16.1.1
Consider a diode circuit with an RLC load, as shown in Figure E16.1.1, and analyze it for i(t)
when the switch S is closed at t = 0. Treat the diode as ideal, so that the reverse recovery time
and the forward voltage drop are negligible. Allow for general initial conditions at t = 0 to have
nonzero current and a capacitor voltage vC = V0.
