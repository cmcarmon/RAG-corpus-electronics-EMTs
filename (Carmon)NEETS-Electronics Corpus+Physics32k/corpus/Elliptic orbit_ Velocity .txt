Under standard assumptions the orbital speed (



v



{\displaystyle v\,}
) of a body traveling along an elliptic orbit can be computed from the vis-viva equation as:




v
=


μ

(



2

r



−


1

a




)





{\displaystyle v={\sqrt {\mu \left({2 \over {r}}-{1 \over {a}}\right)}}}

where:




μ



{\displaystyle \mu \,}
is the standard gravitational parameter,




r



{\displaystyle r\,}
is the distance between the orbiting bodies.




a




{\displaystyle a\,\!}
is the length of the semi-major axis.
The velocity equation for a hyperbolic trajectory has either +





1

a





{\displaystyle {1 \over {a}}}
, or it is the same with the convention that in that case a is negative.
