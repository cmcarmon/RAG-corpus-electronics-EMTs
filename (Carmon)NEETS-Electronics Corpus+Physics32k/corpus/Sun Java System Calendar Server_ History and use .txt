Sun's Java System Calendar Server has a long history, drawing technology from Sun Internet Calendar Server (SICS) and Netscape Calendar Server (NCS). The software undergone several name changes; in addition to the above, it has also been marketed as iPlanet Calendar Server and Sun ONE Calendar Server. The code base has been carried on throughout these name changes with only feature/packaging enhancements and bug fixes.
Since 2003, the Calendar Server has been included as part of Sun's Java Enterprise System, a collection of infrastructure software applications and tools. It is also available as part of the Sun Java System Communications Suite, a smaller collection of messaging and collaboration services that includes Sun Java System Messaging Server, Sun Java System Instant Messaging Server, and Sun Java System Communications Express. Supporting server software for the Calendar Server includes Sun Java System Directory Server, Sun Java System Access Manager, and Sun Java System Web Server. The supporting software is included in the Communications Suite bundle with limited-use license rights.
Calendar Express was the original web-based client interface for the Calendar Server. This HTML client allowed Calendar owners to create appointments, invite others to meetings, and to subscribe to other calendars. The Calendar Express web-client was dropped from support starting with Sun Java System Calendar Server 6.3. This client functionality has been replaced by Sun Java System Communications Express.
The Calendar Server version 6.3 is supported on multiple operating systems including Sun's Solaris and Red Hat Enterprise Linux. HP-UX and Microsoft Windows have since been dropped from support starting with version 6.3.
