A matter wave clock is a type of clock whose principle of operation makes use of the apparent wavelike properties of matter.
Matter waves were first proposed by Louis de Broglie and are sometimes called de Broglie waves. They form a key aspect of waveâ€“particle duality and experiments have since supported the idea. The wave associated with a particle of a given mass, such as an atom, has a defined frequency, and a fixed duration of one cycle from peak to peak that is sometimes called its Compton periodicity. Such a matter wave has the characteristics of a simple clock, in that it marks out fixed and equal intervals of time. The twins paradox arising from Einstein's theory of relativity means that a moving particle will have a slightly different period from a stationary particle. Comparing two such particles allows the construction of a practical "Compton clock".
