The phosphors are placed on the rear substrate of the panel in Fig. 83.31 and are excited by the ultraviolet
light generated by the electrodes on the top substrate. In this case, both sets of ac sustain electrodes are on the
upper substrate. The ac voltage is applied to these electrodes in the normal way and the fringing Ô¨Åelds from
these electrodes reach into the gas and create a discharge. Note that the structure in Fig. 83.31 has glass barrier
rib separators between each sub-pixel. This is necessary to reduce cross-talk between the different colors that
will reduce the color purity. These barrier ribs do not transmit the 147-nm or 173-nm radiation generated by
the xenon gas used in color plasma displays. The phosphors are placed on all walls of the sub-pixel channel
except for the front plate which has the phosphor damaging sputtering activity at the cathodes. This nearly
complete phosphor coverage of the walls maximizes luminance while minimizing sputtering damage.
