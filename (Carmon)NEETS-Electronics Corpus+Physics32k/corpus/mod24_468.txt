LAUNCH CONDITIONS.â€”Measurement personnel must pay attention to how optical power is
launched into the fiber when measuring fiber attenuation. Different distributions of launch power (launch
conditions) can result in different attenuation measurements. This is more of a problem with multimode
fiber than single mode fiber. For single mode fiber, optical power must be launched only into the
fundamental mode. This is accomplished using a mode filter on the fiber. For multimode fiber, the
distribution of power among the modes of the fiber must be controlled. This is accomplished by
controlling the launch spot size and angular distribution.
