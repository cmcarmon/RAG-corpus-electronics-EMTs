One of the major reasons the Internet and, more speciﬁcally, the World Wide Web will increase in use is its
  use  by  the  public.  This  takes  the  form  of  game  playing,  research  responses,  banking,
ability  for 
entertainment, and purchases. Recent trade shows have unveiled incredible interactive games designed for all
. The Web already contains hundreds of
ages that can be played over the Internet from 
sites  that  allow  you  to  respond  directly  to  research  questions,  interest  levels  and  personal  inquiry.  There  are
many sites that already involve banking and the ordering of goods and services. Obviously, the popularity of
these  services  is  directly  related  to  the  public’s  conﬁdence  in  their  security.  Just  as  with  Automated  Teller
Machines, I believe this aspect of technology will be mastered on the Internet, although any code or security
system designed by one can be broken by another.
