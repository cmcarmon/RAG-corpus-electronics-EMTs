The  condition  described  above  of  convergence  almost
everywhere is satisﬁed only in the limit as an inﬁnite number
of terms are included in the Fourier series expansion. If the
inﬁnite series expansion of the Fourier series is truncated to
a ﬁnite number of terms, as it must always be in practical
applications, then the approximation will exhibit an oscilla-
tory behavior around the discontinuity, known as the Gibbs
phenomenon  [Van  Valkenburg,  1974].  Let  sN¢ (t) denote  a
truncated Fourier series approximation of s(t), where only
the terms in Eq. (14.5a) from n = –N to n = N are included
if the complex Fourier series representation is used or where
only the terms in Eq. (14.6a) from n = 0 to n = N are included
if the trigonometric form of the Fourier series is used. It is
well known that in the vicinity of a discontinuity at t0 the
Gibbs phenomenon causes sN¢ (t) to be a poor approximation

to s(t). The peak magnitude of the Gibbs oscillation is 13% of the size of the jump discontinuity s (t 0
regardless of the number of terms used in the approximation. As N increases, the region which contains the
oscillation  becomes  more  concentrated  in  the  neighborhood  of  the  discontinuity,  until,  in  the  limit  as  N
approaches inﬁnity, the Gibbs oscillation is squeezed into a single point of mismatch at t0. The Gibbs phenom-
enon  is  illustrated  in  Fig. 14.5,  where  an  ideal  low-pass  frequency  response  is  approximated  by  an  impulse
response  function  that  has  been  limited  to  having  only N  nonzero  coefﬁcients,  and  hence  the  Fourier  series
expansion contains only a ﬁnite number of terms.
