Procedure 
 
Connect  the  circuit  shown  in  Fig.  5.38.  Set  the  
base  current  meter  to  the  2  mA  range  and  the 
collector current meter to the 20 mA range.  
  Set the variable resistor to minimum position and 
slowly  increase  base  current  until  it  reaches  0.01 
mA.  Measure  and  record  the  collector  current. 
Repeat  for base currents up to 0.1 mA in steps of 
0.02 m, at each stage measuring and recording the 
corresponding value of collector current.  
  Repeat the investigation with at least two further 
types of transistor.
