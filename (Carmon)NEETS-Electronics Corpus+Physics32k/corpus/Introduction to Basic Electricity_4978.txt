Two sides can be etched at the same time; there-
fore, the cost of a double-sided PCB is only slightly 
higher than that of a single-sided PCB. Multilayer 
boards are built up by laminating layers together. A 
four-layer board costs about twice as much as a dou-
ble-sided printed circuit board. The printed circuit 
board is often the most expensive part of a design.
