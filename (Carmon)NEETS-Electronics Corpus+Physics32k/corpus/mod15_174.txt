In the dual-speed synchro system, data is transmitted by the coarse transmitter, while the system is 
far out of correspondence and then is shifted to the fine transmitter as the system approaches 
correspondence. This shifting from coarse to fine control is done automatically when the fine error signal 
exceeds the coarse error signal. The fine synchro transmitter then drives the system to the point of 
correspondence.
