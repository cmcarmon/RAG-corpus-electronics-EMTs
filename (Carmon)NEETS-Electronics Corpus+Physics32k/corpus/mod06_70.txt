The reference point in diode and other tube circuits is usually a common point between the
individual circuits within the tube. The reference point (common) in figure 1-5 is the conductor between
the bottom of the transformer secondary and the negative side of the filament battery. Note that one side
of each voltmeter is connected to this point.
