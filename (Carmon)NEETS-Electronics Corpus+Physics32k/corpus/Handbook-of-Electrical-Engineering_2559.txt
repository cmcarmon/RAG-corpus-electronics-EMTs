This simpliﬁcation is shown in Fig. 24.35(b), where Cin is seen to be shunted by the input parts of the model.
These input parts may be reduced by sequential use of Thévenin–Norton transformations to result in Fig. 24.36,
which  is  a  simple  parallel  RC  circuit  driven  by  a  current  source.  The  actual  value  of  this  current  source  is
immaterial—what  matters  is  that  the  input  signal  to  be  ampliﬁed,  vb9e ,  will  be  progressively  reduced  as  the
frequency rises and the reactance of  Cin falls.
