The Block 1 configuration of SLS will have the ability to insert 70 metric tons into low Earth orbit (LEO) using Shuttle-derived 5-segment Solid Rocket Boosters and a core stage powered by four RS-25 engines. Its second stage, the ICPS, will be considered part of the 70 t payload and on EM-1 it will be placed, along with the Orion crew capsule, on a 1,800 km by -93 km suborbital trajectory to ensure safe disposal of the core stage. At apogee, the ICPS will perform an insertion burn to raise the perigee and put itself and Orion into a stable orbit, and will later perform a translunar injection burn to send the uncrewed Orion capsule on a circumlunar excursion.
To improve on the 70 metric ton Block 1, NASA considered a Block 1A upgrade which would replace the Shuttle-heritage boosters with advanced solid or liquid boosters, and a Block 1B upgrade which would develop an improved second stage. This improved stage was originally named the Dual Use Upper Stage (DUUS, pronounced "duce") but was later renamed the Exploration Upper Stage (EUS) due to DUUS sounding like a profanity in Japanese.

Following concerns that the more powerful Block 1A boosters would have resulted in high acceleration during launch, which would have been unsuitable for the Orion crew vehicle and could have resulted in a costly redesign of the SLS core, NASA announced in 2014 that it would proceed with development of Block 1B with the EUS before advanced boosters. In April 2016 it was reported NASA has chosen to use a design based on four RL10-C3 engines for the EUS, and in Oct 2016 NASA confirmed they had ordered 10 of the engines.
