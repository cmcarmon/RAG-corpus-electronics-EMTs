The most important speech frequencies almost entirely fall below 3 kilohertz. Higher frequencies 
merely help to achieve more perfect sound production. The range of frequencies used to transmit voice 
intelligence over radio circuits depends on the degree of FIDELITY (the ability to faithfully reproduce the 
input in the output) that is desired. The minimum frequency range that can be used for the transmission of 
speech is 500 to 2,000 hertz. The average range used on radiotelephone circuits is 250 to 2,750 hertz.
