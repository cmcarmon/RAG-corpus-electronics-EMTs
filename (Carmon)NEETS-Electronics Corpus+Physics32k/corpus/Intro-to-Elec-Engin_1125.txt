Recall that, in static transformer theory, analysis of the equivalent circuit is often simpliÔ¨Åed
either by neglecting the exciting shunt branch entirely, or by adopting the approximation of moving
it out directly to the terminals. For the induction machine, however, such approximations might
not be permissible under normal running conditions because the air gap leads to a much higher
exciting current (30 to 50% of full-load current) and relatively higher leakage reactances.
