Whenever an electric voltage exists between two separated conductors, an electric ﬁeld is
present within the space between those conductors. In basic electronics, we study the interac-
tions of voltage, current, and resistance as they pertain to circuits, which are conductive paths
through which electrons may travel. When we talk about ﬁelds, however, we’re dealing with
interactions that can be spread across empty space.
