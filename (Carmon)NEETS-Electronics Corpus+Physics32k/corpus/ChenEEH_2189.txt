As described by Ampe`re’s force law discussed in Section 1.4.1,
a magnetic force exists between loops of constant current.
Were the loops free to move, they would migrate toward or
away from each other depending on their orientations. The
work done to keep the current loops stationary is stored as
energy in the magnetic ﬁeld around the loops (Halliday et al.,
2002). Energy is also stored in the magnetic ﬁeld of a single
current loop as well as other situations where a magnetic
ﬁeld exists.
