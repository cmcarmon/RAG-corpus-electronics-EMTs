FIGURE 113.24 Neural motor pathways from the cortex to a typical muscle. The motor areas are represented by Penﬁeld’s
homunculus. A train of 240 stimuli delivered to the motor cortex provided the average MEP detected with electrodes placed
over the spinal column in this patient to whom a muscle paralytic drug was given; therefore the MEPs are from the spinal
cord. (Source: Redrawn from Levy et al., 1984, and Penﬁeld and Rasmussen, 1968.)
