Figure  16.21  shows  a  light  level  threshold 
detector based on a comparator and light-dependent 
resistor (LDR). This arrangement generates a logic 
0 input  whenever  the  light  level  exceeds  the 
threshold  setting,  and  vice  versa.  Figure  16.22 
shows  how  light  level  can  be  sensed  using  a 
photodiode.  This  circuit  behaves  in  the  same 
manner as the LDR equivalent but it is important to 
be  aware  that  circuit  achieves  peak  sensitivity  in 
the near infra-red region. Figure 16.23 shows how 
the  spectral  response  of  a  typical  light-dependent 
resistor  (NORP12)  compares  with 
that  of  a 
conventional  photodiode  (BPX48).  Note  that  the 
BPX48  can  also  be  supplied  with  an  integral 
daylight filter (BPX48F).
