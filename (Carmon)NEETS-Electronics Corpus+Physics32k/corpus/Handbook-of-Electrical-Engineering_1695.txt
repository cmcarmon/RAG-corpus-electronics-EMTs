The early attempts at digital image processing were hampered because of the relatively slow computers used,
i.e., the IBM 7094, the fact that computer time itself was expensive, and that image digitizers had to be built
by the research centers. It was not until the late 1960s that image processing hardware was generally available
(although  expensive).  Today  it  is  possible  to  put  together  a  small  laboratory  system  for  less  than  $60,000;  a
system based on a popular home computer can be assembled for about $5,000. As the cost of computer hardware
