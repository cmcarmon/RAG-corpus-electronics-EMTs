Antenna gain depends on both shape and size. Dipole antennas, commonly used at lower
radio frequencies, are made up of a rod or wire of length λ/10 to λ/2, and have an antenna-gain
range of 1.5 to 1.64 (1.8 to 2.1 dB). Horn antennas and parabolic dishes (so named after their
shapes) have much more gain at higher frequencies. A useful, although approximate, expression
for gain is given by
