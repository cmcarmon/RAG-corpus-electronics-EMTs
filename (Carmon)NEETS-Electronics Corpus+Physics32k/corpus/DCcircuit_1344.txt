Whenever electrons ﬂow through a conductor, a magnetic ﬁeld will develop around that con-
ductor. This effect is called electromagnetism. Magnetic ﬁelds effect the alignment of electrons
in an atom, and can cause physical force to develop between atoms across space just as with
electric ﬁelds developing force between electrically charged particles. Like electric ﬁelds, mag-
netic ﬁelds can occupy completely empty space, and affect matter at a distance.
