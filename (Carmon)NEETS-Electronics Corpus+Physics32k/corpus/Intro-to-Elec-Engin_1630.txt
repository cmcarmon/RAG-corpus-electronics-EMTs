An open-loop system is one in which the control action is independent of the output or desired
result, whereas a closed-loop (feedback) system is one in which the control action is dependent
upon the output. In the case of the open-loop system, the input command (actuating signal) is
the sole factor responsible for providing the control action, whereas for a closed-loop system the
control action is provided by the difference between the input command and the corresponding
output.
