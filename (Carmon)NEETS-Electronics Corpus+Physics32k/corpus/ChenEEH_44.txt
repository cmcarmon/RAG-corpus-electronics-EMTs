For a circuit consisting of linear elements and sources, the
response (voltage or current) in any element in the circuit is
the algebraic sum of the responses in this element obtained by
applying one independent source at a time. When one inde-
pendent source is applied, all other independent sources are
deactivated. It may be noted that a deactivated voltage source
behaves as a short circuit, whereas a deactivated current
source behaves as an open circuit. It should also be noted
that the dependent sources in the circuit are not deactivated.
Further, any initial condition in the circuit is treated as an
appropriate independent source. That is, an initially charged
