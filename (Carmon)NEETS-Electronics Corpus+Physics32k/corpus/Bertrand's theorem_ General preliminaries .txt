All attractive central forces can produce circular orbits, which are naturally closed orbits. The only requirement is that the central force exactly equals the centripetal force, which determines the required angular velocity for a given circular radius. Non-central forces (i.e., those that depend on the angular variables as well as the radius) are ignored here, since they do not produce circular orbits in general.
The equation of motion for the radius r of a particle of mass m moving in a central potential V(r) is given by Lagrange's equations

As noted above, all central forces can produce circular orbits given an appropriate initial velocity. However, if some radial velocity is introduced, these orbits need not be stable (i.e., remain in orbit indefinitely) nor closed (repeatedly returning to exactly the same path). Here we show that stable, exactly closed orbits can be produced only with an inverse-square force or radial harmonic oscillator potential (a necessary condition). In the following sections, we show that those force laws do produce stable, exactly closed orbits (a sufficient condition).

where f represents the radial force. The criterion for perfectly circular motion at a radius r0 is that the first term on the left-hand side be zero

What's more, it must be the same rational number for all radii, since β cannot change continuously; the rational numbers are totally disconnected from one another.

Hence, J must have the general form

For more general deviations from circularity (i.e., when we cannot neglect the higher order terms in the Taylor expansion of J), η may be expanded in a Fourier series, e.g.,

Hence, the only potentials that can produce stable, closed, non-circular orbits are the inverse-square force law (β = 1) and the radial harmonic oscillator potential (β = 2). The solution β = 0 corresponds to perfectly circular orbits, as noted above.
