Consider two situations where a computer system is made up of several subsystems. These may be individual
components or groups of components, e.g., circuit boards. The ﬁrst is where failure of an individual subsystem
implies system failure. This is known as the series model and is shown in Fig. 98.2. This is the same case as
considered previously, and the parts count method, Eqs. (98.12) and (98.13), can be used. The second case is
where failure of an individual subsystem does not imply system failure. This is shown in Fig. 98.3. Only the
failure of every subsystem means that the system has failed, and the system reliability can be evaluated by the
