where f0 is the Larmour frequency, g is the gyromagnetic ratio which is a property of the atomic element, and
H is the magnitude of the external magnetic ﬁeld. For example, given a gyromagnetic ratio of 42.7 MHz/tesla
for hydrogen and a ﬁeld strength of 1 tesla (10 kilogauss), the Larmour frequency would be 42.7 MHz, which
falls into the radio frequency range.
