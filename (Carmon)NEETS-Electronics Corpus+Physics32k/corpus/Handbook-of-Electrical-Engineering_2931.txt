(which is >> RIN) and CC M /2. The dc bias currents at the input are represented by IB
that would equal the input base currents if a differential bipolar transistor were used as the input stage of the
op amp, or the input gate currents if FETs were used. The fact that the two transistors of the input stage of the
op amp may not be perfectly balanced is represented by an equivalent input offset voltage source, VOS , in series
with the input.
