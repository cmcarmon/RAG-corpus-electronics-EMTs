The disadvantage of automatic gain control, attenuating even the weak signal, is overcome by the use
of delayed automatic gain control (dagc). Letâ€™s take a look at the typical dagc circuitry in figure 2-19. This
type of system develops no agc feedback until an established received signal strength is attained. For
signals weaker than this value, no agc is developed. For sufficiently strong signals, the delayed agc circuit
operates essentially the same as ordinary agc.
