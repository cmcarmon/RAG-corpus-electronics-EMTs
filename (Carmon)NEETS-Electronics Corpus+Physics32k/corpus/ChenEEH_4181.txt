. Frequency division multiplexing (FDM): A number of
signals can be carried simultaneously on the same trans-
mission link with each signal being modulated into a
separate frequency. The bandwidth of each signal is re-
duced due to the division of multiple channels. Digital
and analog data can both be supported. CATV is an
example of the use of FDM.
