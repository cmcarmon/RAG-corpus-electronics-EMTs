Single-lobe scanning is unsuitable for use as a tracking radar for several reasons. For example, letâ€™s
assume that a target is somewhere on the lobe axis and the receiver is detecting signals reflected from the
target. If these reflected signals begin to decrease in strength, the target likely has flown off the lobe axis.
In this case, the beam must be moved to continue tracking. The beam might be moved by an operator
tracking the target with an optical sight, but such tracking is slow, inaccurate, and limited by conditions of
visibility. An automatic tracking system would require that the beam SCAN, or search, the target area in
such a case.
