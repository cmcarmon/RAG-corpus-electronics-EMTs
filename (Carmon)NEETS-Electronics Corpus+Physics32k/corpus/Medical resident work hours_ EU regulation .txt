Junior doctors in the European Union fall under the European Working Time Directive, which specifies:
48 working hours per week (down from 56 under the old UK regulations), calculated over a period of 26 weeks.
11 hours continuous rest per day
one day off each week, or two days off each fortnight
20 minutes of continuous rest every 6 hours
However, junior doctors may choose to work more than 48 hours a week, or opt out of the EWTD entirely by signing a waiver with the employer. They may not be punished for not working more than the directed hours. Many trainees nonetheless feel obliged to work longer hours. The rest times are mandatory, but may be taken at another time if it cannot be taken as scheduled.
