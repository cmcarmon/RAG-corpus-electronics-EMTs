The  direction  of  the  E-field  lines  is  reversed  on 
each  cycle  of  the  signal  as  the  wavefront  moves 
outwards  from  the  source.  The  receiving  aerial 
intercepts the moving field and voltage and current 
is induced in it as a consequence. This voltage and 
current is similar (but of smaller amplitude) to that 
produced by the transmitter.
