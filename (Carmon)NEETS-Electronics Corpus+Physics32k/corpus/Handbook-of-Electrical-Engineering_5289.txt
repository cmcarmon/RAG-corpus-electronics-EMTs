Aeroturbines employ lift and/or drag forces to convert wind energy to rotary mechanical energy, which is
 of an aeroturbine
then converted to electrical energy by coupling a suitable generator. The power coefﬁcient 
is the fraction of the incident power converted to mechanical shaft power, and it is a function of the tip speed-
λ
 as shown in Figure 60.3. For a given propeller conﬁguration, at any given wind speed,
to-wind speed ratio 
there is an optimum tip speed that maximizes
