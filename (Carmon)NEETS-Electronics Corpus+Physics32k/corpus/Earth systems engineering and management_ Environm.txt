When examining complex ecologic systems there is an inherent need for the Earth Systems Engineer to have a strong understanding of how natural processes function. A training in Environmental Science will be crucial to fully understand the possible unintended and undesired effects of a proposed earth systems design. Such fundamental topics such as the carbon cycle or the water cycle are pivotal processes that need to be understood.
