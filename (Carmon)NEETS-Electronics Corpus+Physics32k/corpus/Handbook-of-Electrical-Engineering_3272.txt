FIGURE 31.4
Schematic of an optical system forming an image of an object. Light rays from the object are captured by
the lens which focuses them to form the image. EFL, effective focal length, Æ’, of the lens; FFL and BFL, distances from the
focal points to the outer lens surface. Principal planes are the positions to which the focal points, object distance, and image
distance are measured; in a simple lens they are coincident.
