At this level of abstraction, the VLSI designer has a lot of
freedom in employing many techniques to reduce the power
dissipation. Normally, decisions at this level have a global effect
on the whole system. For example, inactive hardware modules
may be automatically turned off to save power; modules may
be provided with the optimum supply voltage and interfaced
by means of level converters. In the following subsections,
different techniques that are applied at this level are pre-
sented, namely parallelism and pipelining exploitation, block-
disabling techniques, clock gating, and intercommunication
and interconnect optimization.
