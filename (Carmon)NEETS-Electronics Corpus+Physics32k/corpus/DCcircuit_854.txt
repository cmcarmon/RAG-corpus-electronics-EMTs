This elementary transmitter/indicator system is reliable and easy to understand, but it has
its limitations. Perhaps greatest is the fact that the system accuracy can be inﬂuenced by
excessive cable resistance. Remember that real voltmeters draw small amounts of current,
even though it is ideal for a voltmeter not to draw any current at all. This being the case,
especially for the kind of heavy, rugged analog meter movement likely used for an industrial-
quality system, there will be a small amount of current through the 2-conductor cable wires.
The cable, having a small amount of resistance along its length, will consequently drop a small
amount of voltage, leaving less voltage across the indicator’s leads than what is across the leads
of the transmitter. This loss of voltage, however small, constitutes an error in measurement:
