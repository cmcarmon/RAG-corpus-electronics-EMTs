Two basic approaches addressing the need for specialized
software for the design and simulation of MEMS have been
taken in the past decade. In the ﬁrst, CAD design tools and
available software from electronics were modiﬁed to accom-
modate the requirement for MEMS design. In the second,
software from mechanics was applied to MEMS. Some of
the software from Tanner Tools VLSI design suite is used
for MEMS (e.g., MEMSPRO and the popular mechanical
engineering software from ANSYS). New suites of software
developed speciﬁcally for MEMS have also been marketed.
Most of them include electronic, mechanical, and thermal
mechanisms, and some have other physical or chemical
mechanisms. In addition, some of them also have process
simulation tools. Examples are the software that is available
from Algor, CFD Research Corporation, Coventor (formerly
called Microcosm Technologies), MEMSCaP, and Corning
IntelliSense Corporation. We will summarize some of the
features of the two software suites, those from MEMSCaP
and Corning IntelliSense Corporation, as illustrations of cur-
rent capabilities.
