The vocal cordsâ€™ periodic output can be well described by the periodic pulse train pT (t) as shown in
the periodic pulse signal (Figure 4.1), with T denoting the pitch period. The spectrum of this signal (4.9)
contains harmonics of the frequency 1/T , what is known as the pitch frequency or the fundamental
