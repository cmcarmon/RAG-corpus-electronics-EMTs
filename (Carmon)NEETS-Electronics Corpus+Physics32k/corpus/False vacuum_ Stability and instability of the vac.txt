Many scientific models of the universe have included the possibility that it exists as a long-lived, but not completely stable, sector of space, which could potentially at some time be destroyed upon 'toppling' into a more stable vacuum state.
A universe in a false vacuum state allows for the formation of a bubble of more stable "true vacuum" at any time or place. This bubble expands outward at the speed of light.
The Standard Model of particle physics opens the possibility of calculating, from the masses of the Higgs boson and the top quark, whether the universe's present electroweak vacuum state is likely to be stable or merely long-lived. (This was sometimes misreported as the Higgs boson "ending" the universe). A 125–127 GeV Higgs mass seems to be extremely close to the boundary for stability (estimated in 2012 as 123.8–135.0 GeV). However, a definitive answer requires much more precise measurements of the top quark's pole mass, and new physics beyond the Standard Model of Particle Physics could drastically change this picture.
