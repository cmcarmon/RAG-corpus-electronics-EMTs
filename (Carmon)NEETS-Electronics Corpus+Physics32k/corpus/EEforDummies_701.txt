(or store) the output bits of one stage for a short 
time before allowing them to be applied to the 
next logic stage. Registers ship their contents 
out and accept new contents in upon receiv-
ing a signal known as a clock tick, which gives 
every gate enough time to compute its output. 
Clock signals are produced by special precision 
timing circuits. (See the section on the 555 timer 
later in this chapter for more information on how 
to create clocks and registers.)
