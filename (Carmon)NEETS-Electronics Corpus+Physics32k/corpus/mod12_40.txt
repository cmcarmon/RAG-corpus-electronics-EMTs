People have always had the desire to communicate their ideas to others. Communications have not 
only been desired from a social point of view, but have been an essential element in the building of 
civilization. Through communications, people have been able to share ideas of mutual benefit to all 
mankind. Early attempts to maintain communications between distant points were limited by several 
factors. For example, the relatively short distance sound would carry and the difficulty of hand-carrying 
messages over great distances hampered effective communications.
