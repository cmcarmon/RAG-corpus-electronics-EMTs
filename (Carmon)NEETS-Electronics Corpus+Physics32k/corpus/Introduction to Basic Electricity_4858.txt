  3.  Filling in between the tasks with sequential steps 
that must be completed to move from one task to 
the next.
When estimating the time required for accom-
plishing each task, consider which team member are 
involved. Let the responsible team members define 
the deadlines. Each team member will have additional 
duties and responsibilities. Taking into account other 
activities, missing days, etc. will require adjustments 
in the suggested timeline. Remember that the time-
line is an estimate and will need to adjust because 
some tasks may be completed earlier than suggested,  
while others may take longer over the course of the 
project. Make the changes right on the timeline and 
keep it as accurate as possible.
