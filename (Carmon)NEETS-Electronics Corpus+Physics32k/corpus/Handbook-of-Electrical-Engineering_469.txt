which is of the form, V1 = h11I1 + h12V2, the ﬁrst h-parameter equation. Thus, for example, h21 = –z21/z22 from
Eq. (3.71). Other transformations are found through similar manipulations and are summarized in Table 3.2.
Finally,  there  are  other  parameter  sets  that  are  deﬁned  differently  from  the  standard  sets  covered  here.
Speciﬁcally, they are scattering parameters used for microwave networks and image parameters used for ﬁlter
design.  A  detailed  discussion  of  these  parameters  is  beyond  the  scope  of  this  section.  The  interested  reader
should consult the bibliography in the “Further Information” section below, or Section 39.1 of this handbook.
