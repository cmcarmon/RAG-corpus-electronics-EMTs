For low speed observers being held at fixed radius from the center of a spherical planet or star, coordinate acceleration ashell is approximately related to proper acceleration ao by:

{\displaystyle {\vec {a}}_{shell}={\vec {a}}_{o}-{\sqrt {\frac {r}{r-r_{s}}}}{\frac {GM}{r^{2}}}{\hat {r}}}

where the planet or star's Schwarzschild radius rs=2GM/c2. As our shell observer's radius approaches the Schwarzschild radius, the proper acceleration ao needed to keep it from falling in becomes intolerable.
On the other hand, for r>>rs, an upward proper force of only GMm/r2 is needed to prevent one from accelerating downward. At the Earth's surface this becomes:

{\displaystyle {\vec {a}}_{shell}={\vec {a}}_{o}-g{\hat {r}}}

where g is the downward 9.8 m/s2 acceleration due to gravity, and

{\displaystyle {\hat {r}}}
is a unit vector in the radially outward direction from the center of the gravitating body. Thus here an outward proper force of mg is needed to keep one from accelerating downward.
