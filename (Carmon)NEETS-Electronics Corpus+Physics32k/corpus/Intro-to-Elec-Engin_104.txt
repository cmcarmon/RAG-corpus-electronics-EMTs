L is the secondary-load resistance referred to the primary side. The consequence of
where R
Equation (1.2.55) is that a resistance RL in the secondary circuit can be replaced by an equivalent

L in the primary circuit in so far as the effect at the source terminals is concerned. The
resistance R
reï¬‚ected resistance through a transformer can be very useful in resistance matching for maximum
power transfer, as we shall see in the following example. Note that the circuits shown in Figure
1.2.13 are indistinguishable viewed from the source terminals.
