The second case is when natural convection acts in the opposite way of the forced convection. Consider a fan forcing air upward over a cold plate. In this case, the buoyancy force of the cold air naturally causes it to fall, but the air being forced upward opposes this natural motion, keeping the cool air hovering around the cold plate. This, in turn, diminishes the amount of heat transfer.
