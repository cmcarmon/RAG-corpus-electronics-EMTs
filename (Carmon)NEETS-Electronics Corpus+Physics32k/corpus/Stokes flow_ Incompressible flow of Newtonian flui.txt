In the common case of an incompressible Newtonian fluid, the Stokes equations take the (vectorized) form:








μ

∇

2



u

−

∇

p
+

f




=

∇

⋅

u




=
0






{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\mu \nabla ^{2}\mathbf {u} -{\boldsymbol {\nabla }}p+\mathbf {f} &={\boldsymbol {0}}\\{\boldsymbol {\nabla }}\cdot \mathbf {u} &=0\end{aligned}}}

Where





u




{\displaystyle \scriptstyle \mathbf {u} }
is the velocity of the fluid,





∇

p



{\displaystyle \scriptstyle {\boldsymbol {\nabla }}p}
is the gradient of the pressure,




μ



{\displaystyle \scriptstyle \mu }
is the dynamic viscosity, and





f




{\displaystyle \scriptstyle \mathbf {f} }
an applied body force. The resulting equations are linear in velocity and pressure, and therefore can take advantage of a variety of linear differential equation solvers.
