Freiwirtschaft consists of three central aspects, usually summed up as The Three Fs:
Freigeld (free money)
All money is issued for a limited period by constant value (neither inflation, nor deflation).
Long-term saving requires investment in bonds or stocks.

Freiland (free land)
All land is commonly owned or else the property of public institutions and can only be rented from the community or from government, respectively, not purchased (see also Georgism).

Freihandel (Free Trade)
Free Trade has long been a mainstream position now, but the anti-globalization movement largely opposes it.
