Sorting is the term given to arranging data records in a predefined sequence or order. Merging is the 
combining of two or more ordered files into one file. For example, we normally think of putting a list of 
people's names in alphabetical order arranging them in sequence by last name. We arrange those with the 
same last name in order by first name.
