As discussed in the previous section, since node voltages are defined with
respect to a common reference, we first need to choose our reference ground
node. While any node may be selected as the ground node, some nodes are
more useful as ground nodes than others. Such useful nodes include those
with the maximum number of circuit elements connected to it. Another useful
ground node is one that connects to the maximum number of voltage sources.
Sometimes the operation of a circuit may be more intuitively understood with
a particular selection of the ground node. Alternatively, voltage measurements
are often more easily or safely made with respect to a certain node and so that
node might naturally be selected as the ground node.
