The top 4 mm of the completed structure, as generated by SUPREM-4, is shown in Fig. 13.10. The actual
simulation  structure  used  is  200  mm  deep  to  allow  correct  modeling  of  the  diffusion  of  the  vacancies  and
interstitials. The gate is at the center of the device. Notice how the edges of the gate have lifted up due to the
diffusion  of  oxidant  under  the  edges  of  the  polysilicon  (the  polysilicon,  as  deposited  in  step  8,  is  ï¬‚at).  The
dashed  contours  show  the  concentration  of  dopants  in  both  the  oxide  and  silicon  layers.  The  short  dashes
