On 9 January 2014 US surveillance satellites observed an object flying at a speed of between Mach 5 and Mach 10 with an altitude of around 100 kilometers. Following Chinese statements the preliminary Pentagon designation for this object is WU-14. In the first phase this unmanned vehicle was brought to its operating height and speed by a military long-range missile.
In August 2015, it was reported that a Chinese researcher had been awarded for the successful development and test flight of a new scramjet engine, the first of its kind in China. This would make China the third country in the world, after Russia and the United States, to have successfully test flown a scramjet. A new near-hypersonic drone, with a variable-cycle turbo-ramjet engine, has also been flown. It is reportedly the fastest air-breathing recoverable vehicle in the world.
It was later revealed that the first flight of a Waverider-like scramjet-powered vehicle occurred in 2011, with flight tests completed by 2014.
