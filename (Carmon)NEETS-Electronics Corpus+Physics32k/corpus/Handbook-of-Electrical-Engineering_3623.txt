Working  in  the  patent  department
at  the  P.R.  Mallory  Company  in  the
1930s, Carlson became frustrated try-
ing to obtain copies of patent drawings
and  speciﬁcations.    Unlike  others
attempting  chemical  photographic
methods,  he  used  the  principles  of
electrostatics  to  produce  his  ﬁrst  dry
copy in 1938.  A photoconductive plate
connected  to  an  electric  charge  was
exposed  to  the  desired  image.    The
plate retained the electric charge on the
dark areas of the image and lost it on
the white areas.  Dusting the plate with a powder reproduced the image.  Xerox Corporation negotiated
rights to the process in 1947 and introduced its ﬁrst ofﬁce copier in 1968.   (Copyright  1995, DewRay
