PML matching conditions analogous to the two-dimensional
cases discussed previously are used. Speciﬁcally, if we denote
w ¼ x, y, z, the matching condition at a normal-to-w PML
interface has the parameter pair (sw, s
w) to satisfy equation
9.94. This causes the transmitted wave in the PML to undergo
exponential decay in thew directions. All other (sw, s
w) pairs
in this PML are zero. In a corner region, the PML is provided
with each matched (sw, s
w) pair that is assigned to the overlap-
ping PMLs forming the corner. Thus, PML media located in
dihedral corner overlapping regions have two nonzero and one
zero (sw, s
w) pairs. PML media located in trihedral corner
overlapping regions have three nonzero (sw, s
