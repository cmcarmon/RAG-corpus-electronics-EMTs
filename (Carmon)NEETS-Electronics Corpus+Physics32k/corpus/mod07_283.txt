In the TUNNEL DIODE, the semiconductor materials used in forming a junction are doped to the 
extent of one-thousand impurity atoms for ten-million semiconductor atoms. This heavy doping produces 
an extremely narrow depletion zone similar to that in the Zener diode. Also because of the heavy doping, 
a tunnel diode exhibits an unusual current-voltage characteristic curve as compared with that of an 
ordinary junction diode. The characteristic curve for a tunnel diode is illustrated in figure 3-5.
