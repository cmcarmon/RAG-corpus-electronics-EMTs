At this point it is important to keep in mind the difference between the entire circuit (or operational
circuit) and the operational amplifier. The operational amplifier is represented by the triangle-like symbol
while the operational circuit includes the resistors and any other components as well as the operational
amplifier. In other words, the input to the circuit is shown in figure 3-13, but the signal at the inverting
input of the operational amplifier is determined by the feedback signal as well as by the circuit input
signal.
