A non-exhaustive listing of ships which have sunk as a result of striking ice masses of larger than "growler" or pack size (such collisions with minor ice are comparatively common, usually resulting in lesser damage). Note that many vessels have been lost without a trace in seas containing icebergs; these are not listed due to other possible explanations and lack of survivor testimony.
