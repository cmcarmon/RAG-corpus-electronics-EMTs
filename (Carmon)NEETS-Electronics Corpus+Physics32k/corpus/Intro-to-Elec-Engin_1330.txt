A basic TDM system is illustrated in Figure 14.2.9(a). Let us assume for simplicity that all
three input signals have equal bandwidths W. A commutator or an electronic switch subsequently
obtains a sample from each input every Ts seconds, thereby producing a multiplexed waveform
with interleaved samples, as shown in Figure 14.2.9(b). Another synchronized commutator at the
destination isolates and distributes the samples to a bank of low-pass Ô¨Ålters (LPFs) for individual
signal reconstruction. More sophisticated TDM systems are available in which the sampled values
are converted to pulse modulation prior to multiplexing and carrier modulation is included after
