The f-number accurately describes the light-gathering ability of a lens only for objects an infinite distance away. This limitation is typically ignored in photography, where objects are usually not extremely close to the camera, relative to the distance between the lens and the film. In optical design, an alternative is often needed for systems where the object is not far from the lens. In these cases the working f-number is used. A practical example of this is, that when focusing closer, the lens' effective aperture becomes smaller, from e.g. f/22 to f/45, thus affecting the exposure.
The working f-number Nw is given by:

{\displaystyle |m|}
is the absolute value of lens's magnification for an object a particular distance away, and P is the pupil magnification. Since the pupil magnification is seldom known, it is often assumed to be 1, which is the correct value for all symmetric lenses.
In photography, the working f-number is described as the f-number corrected for lens extensions by a bellows factor. This is of particular importance in macro photography.
