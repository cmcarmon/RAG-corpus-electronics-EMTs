When the 20 volts is applied across B2 and B1, the n-type bar acts as a voltage- divider. A voltage of 
12.8 volts appears at a point near the emitter. At the first instant, C1 has no voltage across it, so the output 
of the circuit, which is taken across the capacitor (C1), is equal to 0 volts. (The voltage across C1 is also 
the voltage that is applied to the emitter of the unijunction.) The unijunction is now reverse biased. After 
T0, C1 begins to charge toward 20 volts.
