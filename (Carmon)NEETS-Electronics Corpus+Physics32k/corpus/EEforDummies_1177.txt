To test for continuity in a single wire, connect the multimeter test leads to 
either end of the wire and dial up a low‐range ohms setting. You should get a 
reading of 0 Ω or a very low number of ohms. A reading of more than just a 
few ohms indicates a possible break in the wire, causing an open circuit.
