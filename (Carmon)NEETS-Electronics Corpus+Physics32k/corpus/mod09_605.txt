This means that the voltage drop across the capacitor for each harmonic frequency present will not 
be the same. To low frequencies, the capacitor will offer a large opposition, providing a large voltage 
drop across the capacitor. To high frequencies, the reactance of the capacitor will be extremely small, 
causing a small voltage drop across the capacitor. This is no different than was the case for low- and high-
pass filters (discriminators) presented in chapter 1. If the voltage component of the harmonic is not 
developed across the reactance of the capacitor, it will be developed across the resistor, if we observe 
Kirchhoff's voltage law. The harmonic amplitude and phase relationship across the capacitor is not the 
same as that of the original frequency input; therefore, a perfect square wave will not be produced across 
the capacitor. You should remember that the reactance offered to each harmonic frequency will cause a 
change in both the amplitude and phase of each of the individual harmonic frequencies with respect to the 
current reference. The amount of phase and amplitude change taking place across the capacitor depends 
on the XC of the capacitor. The value of the resistance offered by the resistor must also be considered 
here; it is part of the ratio of the voltage development across the network.
