Delay-Line Canceller
A basic MTI single delay-line canceller Ô¨Ålter is shown in
Figure 10.5(A). The delay line has a time delay equal to the
pulse repetition interval. The received signal and the reference
signal are fed to a mixer called the phase detector, whose
output is proportional to the phase difference of the two
input signals.
