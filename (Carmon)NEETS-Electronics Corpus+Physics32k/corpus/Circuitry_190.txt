Average,  peak,  peak-peak,  and  r.m.s. 
values 
 
The average  value of an alternating current which 
swings  symmetrically  above  and  below  zero  will  
be zero when measured over a long period of time. 
Hence average values of currents and voltages are 
invariably  taken  over  one  complete  half-cycle 
(either  positive  or  negative)  rather  than  over  one 
complete  full-cycle  (which  would  result  in  an 
average value of zero). 
  The amplitude (or peak value) of a waveform is 
a measure  of  the  extent  of  its  voltage  or  current 
excursion from the resting value (usually zero). 
  The  peak-to-peak  value  for  a  wave  which  is 
symmetrical about its resting value is twice its peak 
value (see Fig. 4.4). 
  The r.m.s.  (or effective) value  of an alternating 
voltage  or  current  is  the  value  which  would 
produce  the  same  heat  energy  in  a  resistor  as  a 
direct  voltage  or  current  of  the  same  magnitude. 
Since the r.m.s. value of a waveform is very much
