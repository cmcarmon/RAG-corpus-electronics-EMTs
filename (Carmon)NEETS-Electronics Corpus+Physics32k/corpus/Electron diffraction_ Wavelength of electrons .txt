The wavelength of an electron is given by the de Broglie equation




λ
=


h
p


.


{\displaystyle \lambda ={\frac {h}{p}}.}

Here



h


{\displaystyle h}
is Planck's constant and



p


{\displaystyle p}
the relativistic momentum of the electron.



λ


{\displaystyle \lambda }
is called the de Broglie wavelength. The electrons are accelerated in an electric potential



U


{\displaystyle U}
to the desired velocity:




v

{\displaystyle v={\sqrt {\frac {2eU}{m_{0}}}}}






m

{\displaystyle m_{0}}
is the mass of the electron, and



e


{\displaystyle e}
is the elementary charge. The electron wavelength is then given by:

{\displaystyle \lambda ={\frac {h}{p}}={\frac {h}{m_{0}v}}={\frac {h}{\sqrt {2m_{0}eU}}}.}

However, in an electron microscope, the accelerating potential is usually several thousand volts causing the electron to travel at an appreciable fraction of the speed of light. A SEM may typically operate at an accelerating potential of 10,000 volts (10 kV) giving an electron velocity approximately 20% of the speed of light, while a typical TEM can operate at 200 kV raising the electron velocity to 70% the speed of light. We therefore need to take relativistic effects into account. The relativistic relation between energy and momentum is E2=p2c2+m02c4 and it can be shown that,

{\displaystyle p={\sqrt {2m_{0}\Delta E+{\frac {\Delta E^{2}}{c^{2}}}}}={\sqrt {2m_{0}\Delta E}}{\sqrt {1+{\frac {\Delta E}{2m_{0}c^{2}}}}}}

where ΔE = E − E0 = eU. The relativistic formula for the wavelength is then modified to become,

c


{\displaystyle c}
is the speed of light. We recognize the first term in this final expression as the non-relativistic expression derived above, while the last term is a relativistic correction factor. The wavelength of the electrons in a 10 kV SEM is then 12.2 x 10−12 m (12.2 pm) while in a 200 kV TEM the wavelength is 2.5 pm. In comparison the wavelength of X-rays usually used in X-ray diffraction is in the order of 100 pm (Cu Kα: λ=154 pm).
