Synchronous Compensators
A synchronous compensator is a synchronous motor running without a mechanical load. Depending on the
value of excitation, it can absorb or generate reactive power. The losses are considerable compared with static
capacitors. When  used  with  a  voltage  regulator,  the  compensator  can  run  automatically  overexcited  at  high-
load  current  and  underexcited  at  low-load  current.  The  cost  of  installation  of  synchronous  compensators  is
high relative to capacitors.
