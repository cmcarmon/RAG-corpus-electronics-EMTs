It’s all about your connections
In all schematics, simple or complex, components are arranged as neatly 
as possible, and connections in a circuit are drawn as lines, with any bends 
shown as 90° angles. (No squiggles or arcs allowed!) It’s absolutely critical to 
understand what all the lines in a schematic really mean — and their meaning 
is not always obvious.
