Passive Semiconductor Devices
A semiconductor diode can be modeled by a voltage-dependent resistor and capacitor in shunt. Thus an applied
dc voltage can be used to change the value of a passive circuit element. Diodes optimized to produce a voltage
variable capacitor are called varactors. In detector circuits a diode’s voltage variable resistance is used to achieve
rectiﬁcation and, through design, produce a dc voltage proportional to the power of an incident microwave
signal. A controllable variable resistance is used in a PIN diode to realize an electronic switch.
