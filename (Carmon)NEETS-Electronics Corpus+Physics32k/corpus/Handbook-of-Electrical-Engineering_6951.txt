Cross-correlation  functions  of  ws  processes  satisfy  (1)  RXY(–t)  =  RYX(t),  (2) uRXY(t)u2 £  RXX(0)RYY(0),  and
(3) uRXY(t)u  £  (1/2)[RXX(0)  +  RYY(0)].  The  ﬁrst  follows  from  the  deﬁnition,  while  the  second  comes  from
expanding E[{Y(t + t) – aX(t)}2] ‡ 0. The third comes from the fact that the geometric mean cannot exceed
the arithmetic mean [see Peebles, 1987, p. 154].
