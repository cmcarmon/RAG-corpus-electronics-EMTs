Figure 9.9(A) illustrates two nonphysical artifacts arising
from numerical dispersion. First, for both observation cuts,
the leading edge of the wave exhibits an oscillatory spatial jitter
superimposed upon the normal ﬁeld falloff proﬁle. Second,
for the observation cuts along the grid axes, the leading edge
of the wave exhibits a small, spatially decaying, superluminal
component.
