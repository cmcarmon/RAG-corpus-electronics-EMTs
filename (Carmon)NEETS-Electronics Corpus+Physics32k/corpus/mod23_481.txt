The recording density states how close together bits can be stored on the recording surface of a 
magnetic disk. It determines two things: (1) How close together the tracks on the disk will be, and 
(2) how close together the bits on each track will be. An example of a recording density specification is 
"12 Mbits/in2," or 12 million bits per square inch.
