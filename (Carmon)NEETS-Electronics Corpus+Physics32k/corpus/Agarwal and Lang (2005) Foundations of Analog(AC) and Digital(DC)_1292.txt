Thus, the power flowing into one port of an ideal transformer must instanta-
neously flow out from the second port. Said differently, an ideal transformer
cannot store energy. This is consistent with having an infinitely permeable core.
A very useful model for an ideal transformer is shown in Figure 9.30.
This model uses two dependent sources to enforce Equations 9.59 and 9.61.
The voltage-dependent voltage source enforces Equation 9.59 and the current-
dependent current source enforces Equation 9.61.
