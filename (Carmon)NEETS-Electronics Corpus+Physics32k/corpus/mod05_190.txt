Because the dc resistance of most motor armatures is low (0.05 to 0.5 ohm), and because the counter 
emf does not exist until the armature begins to turn, it is necessary to use an external starting resistance in 
series with the armature of a dc motor to keep the initial armature current to a safe value. As the armature 
begins to turn, counter emf increases; and, since the counter emf opposes the applied voltage, the 
armature current is reduced. The external resistance in series with the armature is decreased or eliminated 
as the motor comes up to normal speed and full voltage is applied across the armature.
