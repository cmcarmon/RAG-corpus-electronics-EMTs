where z1 and z2 are the speciﬁc acoustic impedance of the incident and transmitting media, respectively. For a
plane wave the speciﬁc acoustic impedance is equal to the characteristic impedance which is the product of the
density and acoustic speed in the medium (see Table 116.1). The speed is dependent upon the density and the
elastic properties of the medium. Thus, at an interface between media exhibiting different densities or elastic
properties, i.e., compressibility, some acoustic energy will be reﬂected. Although the reﬂection coefﬁcient at an
interface  between  muscle  and  bone  is  large  (approximately  0.54)  the  reﬂection  coefﬁcient  between  two  soft
tissues  such  as  liver  and  muscle  is  quite  small  (approximately  0.006).  Reﬂection  at  oblique  incidence  obeys
Snell’s law in the same way it applies to electromagnetic waves.
