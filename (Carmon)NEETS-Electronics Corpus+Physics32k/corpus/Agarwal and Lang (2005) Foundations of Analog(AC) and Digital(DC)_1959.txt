independent of frequency! The voltage divider has now been compensated for
the effect of C2. Let us examine Equation 13.123 in more detail, and form the
frequency response plots for under-compensation, correct compensation, and
over-compensation. For this purpose it is helpful to rearrange Equation 13.123,
to obtain the system function in our standard form,
