One radar system, called SEARCH RADAR, is designed to continuously scan a volume of space to
provide initial detection of all targets. Search radar is almost always used to detect and determine the
position of new targets for later use by TRACK RADAR. Track radar provides continuous range, bearing,
and elevation data on one or more targets. Most of the radar systems used by the military are in one of
these two categories, though the individual radar systems vary in design and capability.
