The scientific objectives of the mission are:
the search and study of dark matter particles by conducting high-resolution observations of high-energy electrons and gamma rays.
the study of the origin of cosmic rays by observing high energy electrons and heavy nuclei in the TeV energy range.
the study of the propagation and acceleration mechanisms of cosmic rays through the observation of high-energy gamma rays.
