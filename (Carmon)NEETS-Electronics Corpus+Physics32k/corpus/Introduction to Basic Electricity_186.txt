Project	#	1	â€“	Static	Electricity	Analyzer
The	Static	Electricity	Analyzer	can	detect	nearby	static	electricity;	to
indicate	that	static	electricity	is	present,	its	LED	component	glows.	Apart
from	a	detector,	it	can	be	used	to	analyze	the	electricity	in	its	surroundings.
It	is	an	extremely	sensitive	device	since	it	can	even	detect	nearby	hand
movement	without	touching	the	antenna.
