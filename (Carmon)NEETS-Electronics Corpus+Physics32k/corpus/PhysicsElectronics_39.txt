Charge can ﬂow in a material under the inﬂuence of an external electric ﬁeld. Eventually
the internal ﬁeld due to the repositioned charge cancels the external electric ﬁeld resulting
in zero current ﬂow. To maintain a potential drop (and ﬂow of charge) requires an external
energy source, ie. EMF (battery, power supply, signal generator, etc.). We will deal with
two types of EMFs:
it must put out (I → ∞ is possible).
needed (V → ∞ is possible).
