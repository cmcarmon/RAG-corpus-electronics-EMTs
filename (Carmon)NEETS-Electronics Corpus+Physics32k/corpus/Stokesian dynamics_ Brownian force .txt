The stochastic or Brownian force





F



B





{\displaystyle \mathbf {F} ^{\mathrm {B} }}
arises from the thermal fluctuations in the fluid and is characterized by:

{\displaystyle \left\langle \mathbf {F} ^{\mathrm {B} }(0)\mathbf {F} ^{\mathrm {B} }(t)\right\rangle =2kT\mathbf {R} _{\mathrm {FU} }\delta (t)}

The angle brackets denote an ensemble average,



k


{\displaystyle k}
is the Boltzmann constant,



T


{\displaystyle T}
is the absolute temperature and



δ
(
t
)


{\displaystyle \delta (t)}
is the delta function. The amplitude of the correlation between the Brownian forces at time



0


{\displaystyle 0}
and at time



t


{\displaystyle t}
results from the fluctuation-dissipation theorem for the N-body system.
