and other federal authority. The federal laws do not 
 prohibit simple teasing, offhand comments, or  isolated 
incidents that are not serious. To be classified as 
 harassment, the conduct must be so offensive that it 
creates a hostile work environment for an individual.
An individual should report any workplace harass-
ment immediately to a supervisor. If the individualâ€™s 
supervisor is the harasser, the complaint should be 
taken to a higher level.
