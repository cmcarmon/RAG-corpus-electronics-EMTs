Custom processors used in a data-dominated application con-
text are driven from a customized memory organization. In
programmable instruction-set processors, this organization is
usually constructed according to a rigorous hierarchy that can
be considered almost like a bidirectional pipeline from disk2
over main memory and L2/L1 cache to the multiport register
Ô¨Åle. Still, the pipeline gets saturated and blocked more and
more due to the large latencies that are introduced compared
to the CPU clock cycles in current process technologies. This
happens especially for the off-chip memories in the pipeline.
In a custom processor context, more options are open to
increase the on-chip bandwidth to the data, but off-chip simi-
lar restrictions apply for the off-chip. These issues are dis-
cussed in more detail in Subsection 2.3.1.
