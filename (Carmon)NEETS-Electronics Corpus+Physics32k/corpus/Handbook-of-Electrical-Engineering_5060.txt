The resistance thermometer relies on the increase in resistance of a metal wire with increasing temperature.
As the electrons in the metal gain thermal energy, they move about more rapidly and undergo more frequent
collisions with each other and the atomic nuclei. These scattering events reduce the mobility of the electrons,
and  since  resistance  is  inversely  proportional  to  mobility,  the  resistance  increases.  Resistance  thermometers
consist of a coil of ﬁne metal wire. Platinum wire gives the largest linear range of operation. To determine
the  resistance  indirectly,  a  constant  current  is  supplied  and  the  voltage  is  measured. A  direct  measurement
can be made by placing the resistor in the sensing arm of a Wheatstone bridge and adjusting the opposing
resistor  to “balance”  the  bridge,  which  produces  a  null  output. A  measure  of  the  sensitivity  of  a  resistance
)  in  units  of  %  resistance  per
thermometer  is  its  temperature  coefﬁcient  of  resistance:  TCR  =  (
degree of temperature.
