Second, the infinite resistance seen at the gate (G terminal) of a MOSFET
makes it have no effect on the output of another gate driving its input.
This feature of the MOSFET allows us to build systems containing many
gates without worrying about how each gate affects the logical properties
of other gates to which it is connected. This property of a gate is called
composability. Imagine if the MOSFET input had zero resistance. In that
case, we would not be able to connect the output of one inverter to the
input of another and expect the first inverter to satisfy the static discipline.
