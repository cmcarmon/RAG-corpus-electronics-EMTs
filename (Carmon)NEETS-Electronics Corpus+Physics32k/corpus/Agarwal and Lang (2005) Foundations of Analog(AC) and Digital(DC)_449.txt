It is self-evident that with circuits made up of linear resistors, the mutual
conductance e1 to e2 must be the same as the mutual conductance from e2 to
e1. Hence the two off-diagonal coefficients in the node equations are identical.
More generally, we expect node equation coefficients to exhibit mirror symme-
try about the main diagonal for linear resistive circuits, as is evident from the Â¯G
matrix. These helpful topological constraints are destroyed if we do not apply
