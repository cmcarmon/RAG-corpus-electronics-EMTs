Figure 4-24 illustrates the design of a basic fiber optic coupler. A basic fiber optic coupler has N
input ports and M output ports. N and M typically range from 1 to 64. The number of input ports and
output ports vary depending on the intended application for the coupler. Types of fiber optic couplers
include optical splitters, optical combiners, X couplers, star couplers, and tree couplers.
