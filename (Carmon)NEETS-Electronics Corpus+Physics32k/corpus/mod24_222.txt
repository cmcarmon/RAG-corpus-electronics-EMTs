INTRAMODAL, or CHROMATIC, DISPERSION occurs because light travels through different
materials and different waveguide structures at different speeds.MATERIAL DISPERSION is
dependent on the light wavelengths interaction with the refractive index of the core.WAVEGUIDE
DISPERSION is a function of the size of the fiber's core relative to the wavelength of operation.
