 of the MLP to achieve a given input/output map. The
core ideas have been around for many years in optimization, and they are extensions of well-known engineering
 of adaptive Ô¨Åltering [Haykin, 1994]. Let us review
principles, such as the 
(net) = net) and that one wants to adapt the weights as to
the theory here. Assume that we have a linear PE (
minimize the square difference between the desired signal and the PE response (Fig. 20.5).
