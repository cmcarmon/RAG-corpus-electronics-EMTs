Also, note in Fig. 16.2 that the estimate of x is used to compute the Kalman ﬁlter gain, unlike the Kalman ﬁlter,
in which the ﬁlter gain and the error covariance matrices do not depend on x (see Fig. 16.1). Unlike the Kalman
ﬁlter, there is no guarantee that the EKF is stable. Moreover, there is no reason to suppose that the EKF will give
optimal performance. Although in many applications the EKF performance is good, it is well known that the
EKF performance is often poor or far from optimal. Unfortunately, there is no theory that predicts when the
EKF will give good performance, but rather engineers use Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate EKF performance.
There is a vast literature on methods to improve the EKF performance, including second-order Taylor series,
iteration of Fig. 16.2 to improve the linearization, tuning the process noise covariance matrix, decoupling the
