Figure
1.22 shows some two-terminal element connected to an arbitrary circuit at the points
x and y. The element terminal variables v and i are defined according to the associ-
ated variables convention. Suppose that a current of 2 A flows into the circuit terminal
marked x. What is the value of terminal variable i?
Since the chosen direction of the terminal variable i is opposite to that of the 2 A current,
i = âˆ’2 A.
Now suppose that the two terminal element is a resistor (see Figure 1.23) with resistance
R = 10 Ohms. Determine the value of v.
We know that under the associated variables convention the terminal variables
for a resistor are related as
