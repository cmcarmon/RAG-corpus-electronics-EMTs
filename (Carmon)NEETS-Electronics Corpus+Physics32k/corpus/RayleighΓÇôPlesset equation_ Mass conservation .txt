By conservation of mass, the inverse-square law requires that the radially outward velocity



u
(
r
,
t
)


{\displaystyle u(r,t)}
must be inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the origin (the center of the bubble). Therefore, letting



F
(
t
)


{\displaystyle F(t)}
be some function of time,




u
(
r
,
t
)
=



F
(
t
)


r

2






{\displaystyle u(r,t)={\frac {F(t)}{r^{2}}}}

In the case of zero mass transport across the bubble surface, the velocity at the interface must be




u
(
R
,
t
)
=



d
R


d
t



=



F
(

R

{\displaystyle u(R,t)={\frac {dR}{dt}}={\frac {F(t)}{R^{2}}}}

which gives that

In the case where mass transport occurs, the rate of mass increase inside the bubble is given by

with



V


{\displaystyle V}
being the volume of the bubble. If




u

L




{\displaystyle u_{L}}
is the velocity of the liquid relative to the bubble at

{\displaystyle r=R}

{\displaystyle \rho _{L}\gg \rho _{V}}
