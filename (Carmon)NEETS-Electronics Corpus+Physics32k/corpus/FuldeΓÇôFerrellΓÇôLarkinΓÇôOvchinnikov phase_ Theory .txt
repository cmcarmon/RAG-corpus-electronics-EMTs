If a BCS superconductor with a ground state consisting of Cooper pair singlets (and center-of-mass momentum q=0) is subjected to an applied magnetic field, then the spin structure is not affected until the Zeeman energy is strong enough to flip one spin of the singlet and break the Cooper pair, thus destroying superconductivity (paramagnetic or Pauli pair breaking). If instead one considers the normal, metallic state at the same finite magnetic field, then the Zeeman energy leads to different Fermi surfaces for spin-up and spin-down electrons, which can lead to superconducting pairing where Cooper pair singlets are formed with a finite center-of-mass momentum q, corresponding to the displacement of the two Fermi surfaces. A non-vanishing pairing momentum leads to a spatially modulated order parameter with wave vector q.
