2. Notice that the internal behavior of the element can be arbitrarily complicated, but the spe-
cific relationship between the voltage and current at the terminals will completely characterize its
behavior to any circuit to which this element is connected.
3. We can arrive at the same property in a different way, as follows: A nonzero but constant flux
external to an element can be the result of a current flowing internal to the element, or produced
by an external source.
