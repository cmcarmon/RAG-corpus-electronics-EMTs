Minor-Loop Design
In our efforts thus far in this section we have assumed that compensating networks would be placed in series
with the ﬁxed plant and then a unity feedback ratio loop closed around these elements to yield the closed-loop
system. In many applications it may be physically convenient, perhaps due to instrumentation considerations,
to use one or more minor loops to obtain a desired compensation of a ﬁxed plant transfer function.
