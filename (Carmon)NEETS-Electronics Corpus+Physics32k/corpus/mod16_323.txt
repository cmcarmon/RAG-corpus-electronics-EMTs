SHUNT SELECTION.â€”When using an external-shunt ammeter, you should select a suitable shunt
so that the scale deflection can be easily read. For example, if the scale has 150 divisions and the load
current you want to measure is known to be between 50 and 100 amperes, a 150-ampere shunt would be
the correct choice. Under these conditions, each division of the scale represents 1 ampere. In other words,
