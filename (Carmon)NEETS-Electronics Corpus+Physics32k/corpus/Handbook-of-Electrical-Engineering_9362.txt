2. Liquid crystal display (LCD): This device uses matrix addressing and refreshes the display one row at a
time. Appropriate voltages are applied to the crystals, causing them to line up. They remain polarized,
not allowing light to pass through; light is absorbed, causing dark spots on the display. These devices
are light in weight, rugged, and have a low power consumption, fair intensity, and low cost.
