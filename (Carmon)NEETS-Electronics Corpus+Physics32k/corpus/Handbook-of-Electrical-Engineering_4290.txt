For the case of sinusoidal frequency modulation the spectrum consists of a series of lines spaced away from
the carrier by the modulating frequency or its harmonics. The amplitudes of the carrier and these sidebands
are proportional to the values of the Bessel functions of the ﬁrst kind ( Jn, n = 0, … 1, … 2, … 3, …), whose
argument is a function of the modulating frequency and range. By choosing a particular modulating frequency,
the values of the Bessel functions and thus the characteristics of the spectral components can be inﬂuenced.
For instance, the signal variation with range at selected ranges can be optimized, which is important in fuzes.
A  short-range  dependence  that  produces  a  rapid  increase  in  signal,  greater  than  that  corresponding  to  the
normal  range  variation,  is  beneﬁcial  in  producing  well-deﬁned  ﬁring  signals.  This  can  be  accomplished  by
proper choice of modulating frequency and ﬁltering to obtain the signal spectral components corresponding
to the appropriate order of the Bessel function. In a similar fashion, spillover and/or reﬂections from close-in
objects can be reduced by ﬁltering to pass only certain harmonics of the modulating frequency (Fm). Receiving
only frequencies near 3Fm results in considerable spillover rejection, but at a penalty of 4 to 10 dB in signal-
to-noise [Nathanson, 1991].
