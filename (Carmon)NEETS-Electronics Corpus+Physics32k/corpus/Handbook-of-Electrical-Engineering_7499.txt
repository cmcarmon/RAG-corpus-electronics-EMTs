The second issue of the series was published in 1988 and is roughly evenly split between links and networks
[Balaban et al., 1988]. In this issue the emphasis is much more on techniques than on simulation packages.
The third part of the series is a two-volume issue devoted exclusively to networks [Mouftah et al., 1990, 1991].
As  of  this  writing,  the  book  by  Jeruchim  et al.  is  the  only  comprehensive  treatment  of  the  simulation  of
communication  links  [Jeruchim,  1984].  It  treats  the  component  and  channel  modeling  problem  and  the
problems  associated  with  using  simulation  techniques  for  estimating  the  performance  of  communication
systems  in  considerable  detail.  This  textbook,  together  with  the  previously  cited  JSAC  issues,  gives  a  good
overview of the area.
