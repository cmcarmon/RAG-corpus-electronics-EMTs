it not for the integrated circuit (IC). This incredible innovation — 
really, a series of incredible innovations — makes possible 
your smartphone, tablet, iPod, and GPS navigation system, 
as well as newer disruptive technologies, such as 3D 
printing and autonomous (self‐ driving) vehicles. Who 
knows? One day ICs may enable you to 3D‐print your 
own driverless car!
