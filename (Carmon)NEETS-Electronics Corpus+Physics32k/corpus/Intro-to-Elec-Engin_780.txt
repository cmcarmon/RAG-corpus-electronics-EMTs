Both DTL and TTL are called saturating logic families, because the BJTs in the circuit
are biased into the saturated region to achieve the effect of a closed switch. The inherent slow
switching speed is a major difﬁculty with saturating logic because saturated BJTs store signiﬁcant
charge and switch rather slowly. Schottky TTL is a nonsaturating logic family that was later
developed to achieve higher speed performance by preventing the transistors from saturating.
Another bipolar nonsaturating logic family is ECL (emitter-coupled logic), which has BJTs that
remain biased in the active region. These circuits consume more power, are less dense, but are
extremely fast.
