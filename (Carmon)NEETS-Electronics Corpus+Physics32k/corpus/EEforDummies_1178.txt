To test for a short between different wires that shouldn’t be electrically con-
nected, you set the meter to measure ohms, and then connect one of the test 
leads to an exposed end of one wire and the other test lead to an exposed 
end of the other wire. If you get a reading of 0 Ω or a low number of ohms, 
you may have a short circuit between the wires. A higher reading usually 
means your wires are not shorted together. (Note that you may get a reading 
other than infinite ohms if the wires are still connected to your circuit when 
you make the measurement. Rest assured that your wires are not shorted 
unless your reading is very low or zero.)
