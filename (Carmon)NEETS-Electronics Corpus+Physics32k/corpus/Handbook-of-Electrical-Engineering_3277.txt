Two methods are commonly used for quantifying light energy, namely, the radiometric unit of watts and
the photometric unit of candelas. The candela is an energy unit which is derived from light emission from a
blackbody  source.  The  two  can  be  related  using  the  relative  visibility  curve  V(l),  which  describes  the  eye’s
sensitivity to the visible light spectrum, it being maximum near a wavelength of 550 nm. The constant which
relates lumens to watts at this wavelength is 685 lm/W. The luminous ﬂux emitted by a source can therefore
be written as
