The two input terminals are labeled "inverting input" ( - ) and "noninverting input" (+). The
operational amplifier can be used with three different input conditions (modes). With differential inputs
(first mode), both input terminals are used and two input signals which are 180 degrees out of phase with
each other are used. This produces an output signal that is in phase with the signal on the noninverting
input. If the noninverting input is grounded and a signal is applied to the inverting input (second mode),
the output signal will be 180 degrees out of phase with the input signal (and one-half the amplitude of the
first mode output). If the inverting input is grounded and a signal is applied to the noninverting input
(third mode), the output signal will be in phase with the input signal (and one-half the amplitude of the
first mode output).
