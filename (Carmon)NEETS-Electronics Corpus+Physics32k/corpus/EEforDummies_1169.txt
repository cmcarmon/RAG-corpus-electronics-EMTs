This test doesn’t tell you the capacitance value or whether the capacitor is 
open, which can happen if the component becomes structurally damaged 
inside or if its dielectric (insulating material) dries out or leaks. An open 
capacitor reads infinite ohms, just like a good capacitor. For a conclusive 
test, use a multimeter with a capacitor‐testing function.
