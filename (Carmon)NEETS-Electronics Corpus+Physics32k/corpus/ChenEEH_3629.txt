Efﬁcient software implementations of digital ﬁlters are
usually based on special-purpose CPUs known as Digital
Signal Processors (DSPs). These processors are capable of
implementing a sum of product operations, also referred to
as multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) operations, in a very efﬁ-
cient manner.
