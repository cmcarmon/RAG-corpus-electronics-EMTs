The diathermy frequency of 27.12 MHz used for PRF therapy has also been employed, with ELF amplitude
modulation, to induce sleep. At least one double blind study [Reite et al., 1994] has shown the effectiveness for
this purpose of “Low Energy Emission Therapy” (LEET). In this application, the 27.12 MHz carrier is period-
ically  amplitude  modulated  with  a  42.7  Hz  sine  wave  for  3  s  and  then  interrupted  for  1  s  during  a  15-min
treatment period. The signal is applied by means of an electrically conducting mouthpiece in direct contact
with the oral mucosa. “The estimated local SAR (“speciﬁc absorption rate”) is less than 10 W/kg in the oral
mucosa  and  0.1  to  100  mW/kg  in  brain  tissue,  with  high  SAR  values  only  in  the  conduction  area  between
tongue and mouth piece” [Reite et al., 1994]. The RF electrical ﬁeld strength in the ﬂuid surrounding neurons
is calculated to be in the range of the ELF electrical ﬁelds generated by normal brain activity. No information
is available on either positive or negative long term health effects, if any, due to treatment with this device.
