To facilitate the description of power systems, a graphical
representation of the power system components as shown in
Figure 9.2 is used. Such representation is called a one-line
diagram. It is reducing the presentation complexity of the
three-phase connections into a single-line connection. This is
sufﬁciently detailed when the normal system operation is con-
sidered since the solutions of voltages and currents are sym-
metrical and one-line representations resemble very closely the
single-phase system representation used to obtain the solution.
The solution for the faulted systems requires more detailed
three-phase representation, but the one-line diagram is still
sufﬁcient to discuss the basic relaying concepts. In that case, a
detailed representation of the faults shown in Figure 9.1 is not
used, but a single symbol representing all fault types is used
instead.
