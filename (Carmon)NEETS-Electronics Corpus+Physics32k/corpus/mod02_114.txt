 Two coils are placed close together as shown in figure 2-13. Coil 1 is connected to a battery through 
switch S, and coil 2 is connected to an ammeter (A). When switch S is closed as in figure 2-13(A), the 
current that flows in coil 1 sets up a magnetic field that links with coil 2, causing an induced voltage in 
coil 2 and a momentary deflection of the ammeter. When the current in coil 1 reaches a steady value, the 
ammeter returns to zero. If switch S is now opened as in figure 2-13(B), the ammeter (A) deflects 
momentarily in the opposite direction, indicating a momentary flow of current in the opposite direction in 
coil 2. This current in coil 2 is produced by the collapsing magnetic field of coil 1.
