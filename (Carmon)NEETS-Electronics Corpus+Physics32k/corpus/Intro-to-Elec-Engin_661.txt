where ISE is the reverse saturation current of the BEJ, ICBO is the reverse saturation current of
the CBJ, α (known as common-base current gain or forward-current transfer ratio, typically
ranging from about 0.9 to 0.998) is the fraction of iE that contributes to the collector current, and
VT = kT /q is the thermal voltage (which is the voltage equivalent of temperature, having a value
of 25.861 × 10
