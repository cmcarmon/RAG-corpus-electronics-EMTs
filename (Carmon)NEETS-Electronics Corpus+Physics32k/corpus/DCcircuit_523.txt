Progressing from a nice, neat, schematic diagram to the real circuit – especially when the
resistors to be connected are physically arranged in a linear fashion on the terminal strip
– is not obvious to many, so I’ll outline the process step-by-step. First, start with the clean
schematic diagram and all components secured to the terminal strip, with no connecting wires:
