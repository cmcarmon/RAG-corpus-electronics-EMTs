where f = the frequency, Hz; L = the inductance, H; R = the dc resistance, W (as measured by an ohmmeter);
and XL = the inductive reactance of the coil.
Time Constant
When a dc voltage is applied to an RL circuit, a certain amount of time is required to change the circuit [see
text with Eq. (1.31)]. The time constant can be determined with the equation
