An earth anchor is a device designed to support structures, most commonly used in geotechnical and construction applications. Also known as a ground anchor, percussion driven earth anchor or mechanical anchor, it may be impact driven into the ground or run in spirally, depending on its design and intended force-resistance characteristics.
Earth anchors are used in both temporary or permanent applications, including supporting retaining walls, guyed masts, and circus tents.
