For a test particle whose mass m is "small", in a stationary system, the net (Lorentz) force acting on it due to a GEM field is described by the following GEM analog to the Lorentz force equation:
where:
v is the velocity of the test particle;
m is the mass of the test particle;
q is the electric charge of the test particle.
