Because this is an inductive circuit, and we know that inductors oppose change in current,
we’ll set up our time constant formula for starting and ﬁnal values of current. If we start with
the switch in the open position, the current will be equal to zero, so zero is our starting current
value. After the switch has been left closed for a long time, the current will settle out to its ﬁnal
value, equal to the source voltage divided by the total circuit resistance (I=E/R), or 15 amps in
the case of this circuit.
