In radars that require accurate range measurement, the transmitted rf pulse must have a steep leading
edge. The leading edge of the echo is used for range measurement. If the leading edge of the echo is not
steep and clearly defined, accurate range measurement is not possible. The leading and trailing edges of
echoes have the same shape as the leading and trailing edges of the transmitted rf pulse.
