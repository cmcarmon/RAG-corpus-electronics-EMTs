The PEMF signals employed by the various manufacturers in the United
States  and  Europe  can  have  several  different  pulse  shapes,  rise  and  decay
times, pulse widths, pulse repetition rates, and amplitudes. Since it has been
shown (see Mechanisms and Dosimetry) that all these variables can have
a profound effect on the biological action of a particular signal, it is essential
that reports on effectiveness or lack of effectiveness of PEMF give an exact
description of the signal which was used. Unfortunately the medical liter-
ature  is  replete  with  examples  where  this  information  is  either  incomplete  or  completely  absent.  Details  of
shape,  orientation,  and  location  of  the  application  coil  or  coils  are  also  important,  since  these  parameters,
together with pulse amplitude and shape, determine the nature of the magnetic and electric ﬁeld at the location
of  the  injured  tissue.  If  the  amplitude  of  the  axially  directed  magnetic  ﬂux  density B  is  constant  over  some
region of radius R within the cross section of a circular cylinder, the induced electric ﬁeld is
