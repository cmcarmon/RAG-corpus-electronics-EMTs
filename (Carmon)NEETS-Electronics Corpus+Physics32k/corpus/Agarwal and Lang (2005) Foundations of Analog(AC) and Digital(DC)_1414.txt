However, in practice, if we were to observe the output vOUT1 on an oscil-
loscope, we would notice that the change in the output is not instantaneous;
rather the output changes from one valid voltage level (for example, a logical 0)
to another valid voltage level (for example, a logical 1) more slowly over a small
period of time as suggested by the signal marked vOUT1(actual) in Figure 10.16.
How does this slow transition affect the behavior of the digital circuit?
