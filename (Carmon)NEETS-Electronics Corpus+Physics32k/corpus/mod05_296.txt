A rotating magnetic field is probably most easily seen in a two-phase stator. The stator of a two-
phase induction motor is made up of two windings (or a multiple of two). They are placed at right angles
to each other around the stator. The simplified drawing in figure 4-2 illustrates a two-phase stator.
