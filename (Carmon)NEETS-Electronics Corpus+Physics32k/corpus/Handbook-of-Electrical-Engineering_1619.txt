Mean-Square Estimation
For the simplicity of our discussion we consider the case of estimating a single continuous type random variable
q with density p(q) instead of estimating a random vector. We also reduce the dimensionality of the observation
space to one. In this framework the penalty function will be the square of the estimation error (q â€“ q^ )2 and
the performance or optimality criterion will be the minimization of the mean (expected) square value of the
estimation error.
