The interaction of the photons suggests that the effect could be employed to build a system that can preserve quantum information, and process it using quantum logic operations.
The system could also be useful in classical computing, given the much-lower power required to manipulate photons than electrons.
It may be possible to arrange the photonic molecules in such a way within the medium that they form larger three-dimensional structures (similar to crystals).
