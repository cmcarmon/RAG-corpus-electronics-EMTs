Summing g
t(i) over t yields a quantity which can be interpreted as the expected number of transitions from
state Si . Summing x
t (i,j) over t gives the expected number of transitions from state i to state j. An estimate of
aij can then be computed as the ratio of these two sums. Similarly, an estimate of bj(k) is obtained as the expected
number of times being in state j and observing symbol vk divided by the expected number of times in state j.
