1. In the ﬁrst loop equation with mesh current I1, the coefﬁcient of I1 is the sum of the
resistances in that mesh; the coefﬁcient of I2 is the negative sum of the resistances common
to both meshes. The right-hand side of the equation is the algebraic sum of the source
voltage rises taken in the direction of I1.
