The calorimeters are the most accurate of all instruments for measuring high power. Calorimeters 
depend on the complete conversion of the input electromagnetic energy into heat. Direct heating requires 
the measurement of the heating effect on the medium, or load, terminating the line. Indirect heating 
requires the measurement of the heating effect on a medium or body other than the original power-
absorbing material. Power measurement with true calorimeter methods is based solely on temperature, 
mass, and time. Substitution methods use a known, low-frequency power to produce the same physical 
effect as an unknown rf power being measured. Calorimeters are classified as STATIC (nonflow) types 
and CIRCULATING (flow) types.
