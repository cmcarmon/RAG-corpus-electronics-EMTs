. Electrically erasable programmable ROM (EEPROM) is
user-modiﬁable ROM that can be erased and repro-
grammed repeatedly by applying speciﬁc electrical pulses.
Unlike for EPROM, an EEPROM chip has to be erased
and reprogrammed in its
selectively.
EEPROM also has a limited life span (limited program-
mability). Moreover, the largest EEPROMs are only 1/64
as large as common EPROMs, and they are only half as
fast. At
this point, EEPROMs cannot compete with
SRAMs and DRAMs because the latter two have much
smaller capacity with much less speed and are more
expensive. Presently, EEPROMs are mainly used in rapid
device prototyping where nonvolatility and easy repro-
grammability are crucial. Figure 1.5 illustrates the uses of
EPROM and EEPROM technology in high-density pro-
grammable logic devices (PLD) for rapid prototyping.
Figure 1.5 (A) shows a picture of Altera’s MAX 5000
device that is EPROM-based. MAX 5000 family provides
logic densities ranging from 600 to 3750 usable gates. This
family of devices was launched in 1988. Figure 1.5 (B)
shows a picture of Altera’s MAX 7000 EEPROM-based
device. The MAX 7000 family provides logic densities
ranging from 600 to 5000 usable gates. This family of
products was launch in 1992.
