During the second half cycle (indicated by the dotted lines), the polarity of the applied voltage has 
reversed. Now the anode of D2 is positive with respect to ground and the anode of D1 is negative. Now 
only D2 can conduct. Current now flows, as shown, from ground (center tap), up through the load resistor 
(RL), through diode D2 to point B of T1. In the transformer, current flows from point B up through the 
lower windings and back to ground (center tap). Notice that the current flows across the load resistor (RL) 
in the same direction for both halves of the input cycle.
