The next step in our study of second-order circuits is to include a loss mechanism
through which energy stored in the circuit will dissipate. Second-order circuits
can exhibit loss for two reasons. First, real capacitors and real inductors are
lossy. A common loss mechanism in a capacitor is dielectric leakage, which can
be modeled with a parallel resistor. A common loss mechanism in an inductor
is the resistive loss in its winding, which can be modeled with a series resistor.
Second, we may purposefully introduce loss into a circuit in order to modify
its behavior. For example, we might wish to suppress the oscillations seen in
Figure 12.3. Again, this is accomplished by including one or more resistors.
