The  instrumentation  ampliﬁer  is  an  extension  of  the  difference
ampliﬁer  in  that  it  ampliﬁes  the  difference  between  its  input  signals.
As shown in Fig. 5.26 (see Example 5.8), an instrumentation ampliﬁer
typically  consists  of  three  op  amps  and  seven  resistors.  For  conven-
ience, the ampliﬁer is shown again in Fig. 5.38(a), where the resistors are
made equal except for the external gain-setting resistor RG, connected
between  the  gain  set  terminals.  Figure  5.38(b)  shows  its  schematic
symbol. Example 5.8 showed that
