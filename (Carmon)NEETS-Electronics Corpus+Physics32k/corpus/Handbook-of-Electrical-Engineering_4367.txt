Linewidth: The range of wavelengths emitted by a source or present in a pulse.
Meridional ray: A ray that is contained in a plane passing through the ﬁber axis.
Mode chart: A graphical illustration of the variation of effective refractive index (or, equivalently, propagation
angle q) with normalized thickness d/l for a slab waveguide or normalized frequency V for an optical ﬁber.
Refractive index: The ratio of the velocity of light in free space to the velocity of light in a given medium.
