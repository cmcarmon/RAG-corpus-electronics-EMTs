First, look at the part of the curve to the left of point A. Because it is not a straight line, it is referred
to as NONLINEAR. Note that a change of 150 volts (0-150) caused a change of 10 mA of plate current
(0-10). In comparison with the straight-line part of the curve, between points A and B, this is a relatively
small change in current. The smaller the change in current, the flatter the curve.
