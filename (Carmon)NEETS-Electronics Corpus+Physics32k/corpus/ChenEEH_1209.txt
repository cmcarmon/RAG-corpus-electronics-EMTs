In the long term, new design or technology solutions (such
as coplanar wave guides, free space RF, and optical intercon-
nect) will be needed to overcome the performance limitations
of traditional interconnect (Sematech, 1999). Inductive effects
will also become increasingly important as frequency of oper-
ation increases, and additional metal patterns or ground planes
may be required for inductive shielding. As supply voltage is
scaled or reduced, cross talk has become an issue for all clock
and signal wiring levels; the near term solution adopted by the
industry is the use of thinner metallization to lower line-to-
line capacitance. This approach is more effective for the lower
resistivity copper metallization,
for which reduced aspect
ratios (A/R) can be achieved with less sacriÔ¨Åce in resistance
