Seeing is believing
In visual systems, electronic components control the timing and intensity of 
light emissions. Many remote‚Äêcontrol devices, such as your TV remote, emit 
infrared light (which is not visible) when you press a button, and the specific 
pattern of the emitted light acts as a sort of code that is understood by the 
device you are controlling. A circuit in your TV detects the infrared light and, 
in effect, decodes the instructions sent by the remote.
