For the more general case of the canonical ensemble, the absolute entropy depends exclusively on the probabilities of the microstates and is defined as




S
=
−

k

B




∑

,


{\displaystyle S=-k_{B}\,\sum _{i}p_{i}\ln \,p_{i},}

where




k

B




{\displaystyle k_{B}}
is Boltzmann's constant. For the microcanonical ensemble, consisting of only those microstates with energy equal to the energy of the macrostate, this simplifies to




S
=

k

B



ln

W


{\displaystyle S=k_{B}\,\ln W}
,
where



W


{\displaystyle W}
is the number of microstates. This form for entropy appears on Ludwig Boltzmann's gravestone in Vienna.
The second law of thermodynamics describes how the entropy of an isolated system changes in time. The third law of thermodynamics is consistent with this definition, since zero entropy means that the macrostate of the system reduces to a single microstate.
