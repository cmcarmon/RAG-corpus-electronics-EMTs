Example 6.2.7  As an example, let us consider the circuit of Fig. 6.9(a) with the transformed circuit shown in
Fig. 6.9(b). The initial conditions are i(0) = 1 A and v(0) = 4 V. Let us ﬁnd v(t) for t > 0 by replacing everything
to  the  right  of  the  4-W  resistor  in  Fig.  6.9(b)  by  its  Thévenin  equivalent  circuit. We  may  ﬁnd Zth(s)  directly
from Fig. 6.9(b) as the impedance to the right of the resistor with the two current sources made zero (open
circuited).  For  illustrative  purposes  we  choose,  however,  to  ﬁnd  the  open-circuit  voltage  and  short-circuit
current shown in Figs. 6.10(a) and (b), respectively, and use Eq. (6.13) to get the Thévenin impedance.
