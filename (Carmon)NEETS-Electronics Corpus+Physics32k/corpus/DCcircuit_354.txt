As far as the voltage source and load are concerned, grounding makes no difference at all.
It exists purely for the sake of personnel safety, by guaranteeing that at least one point in the
circuit will be safe to touch (zero voltage to ground). The ”Hot” side of the circuit, named for
its potential for shock hazard, will be dangerous to touch unless voltage is secured by proper
disconnection from the source (ideally, using a systematic lock-out/tag-out procedure).
