Figure 1-13 shows a simplified schematic diagram of the capacitance-measuring section of a typical
reactance-type electronic volt-ohm-capacitance milliammeter. A 6.3-vac voltage is taken from the
filament source and applied across the resistive voltage divider network to determine the designated value
of the capacitor. Because of a particular use or circuit application, some capacitors are permitted an even
wider variation of capacitance value than is indicated by their rated tolerances.
