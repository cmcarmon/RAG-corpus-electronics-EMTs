LAN Growth
The success of LANs throughout the 1980s has been phenomenal. However, the projected growth throughout
the 1990s is equally as impressive (see Fig. 75.5). This can be attributed not only to new installations of LANs,
but also to the physical and logical segmentation of LANs as trafÔ¨Åc and throughput degradations are observed.
