NOTE ON SYMBOLS USED IN THE FOLLOWING SECTIONS: IEEE and ANSI standards (see
inside front cover) are used to define various terms, such as anode (plate) current, anode voltage, and
anode resistance. This book uses Ea  for anode voltage, Ia for anode current, and ra for anode resistance.
These are the same as E, Ip, and rp that you will see elsewhere. This module uses the terms anode and plate
interchangeably.
