Sigma is given by the Greek letter sigma in lower case with star velocity in subscript (σν☉). In physics and mathematics lower case sigma means set or group. This is appropriate for the property sigma as it is a measurement of a group of star speeds. The above correlation is given by-
[(Q2+(J/M)2≤M2)=106*M☉]≈50 km/s(σν☉)
The black hole mass equal to 1,000,000 times the mass of the Sun is approximately equal to the sigma of a star travelling at 50 km/s. The increase factor is
106n*101=xKm/s+50 km/s.
