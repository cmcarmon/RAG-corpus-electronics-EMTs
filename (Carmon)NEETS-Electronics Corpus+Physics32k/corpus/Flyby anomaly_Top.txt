The flyby anomaly is a discrepancy between current scientific models and the actual increase in speed (i.e. increase in kinetic energy) observed during a planetary flyby by a spacecraft. In multiple cases, spacecraft have been observed to gain greater speed than scientists have predicted and, as yet, no convincing explanation has been found. This anomaly has been observed as shifts in the S-band and X-band Doppler and ranging telemetry. Taken together, it causes a significant unaccounted velocity increase of up to 13 mm/s during flybys. Numerically larger discrepancies (400â€“1000 m) have been observed at least in one flyby (NEAR) against Space Surveillance Network (SSN) radars.
