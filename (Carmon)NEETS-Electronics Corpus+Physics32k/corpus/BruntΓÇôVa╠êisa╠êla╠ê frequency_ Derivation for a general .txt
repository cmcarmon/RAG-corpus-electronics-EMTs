Consider a parcel of (water or gas) that has density of




ρ

0




{\displaystyle \rho _{0}}
and the environment with a density that is a function of height:



ρ
=
ρ
(
z
)


{\displaystyle \rho =\rho (z)}
. If the parcel is displaced by a small vertical increment




z
′



{\displaystyle z'}
, it will be subject to an extra gravitational force against its surroundings of:

)
)


{\displaystyle \rho _{0}{\frac {\partial ^{2}z'}{\partial t^{2}}}=-g(\rho (z)-\rho (z+z'))}





g


{\displaystyle g}
is the gravitational acceleration, and is defined to be positive. We make a linear approximation to

∂

z

{\displaystyle \rho (z+z')-\rho (z)={\frac {\partial \rho (z)}{\partial z}}z'}
, and move

{\displaystyle \rho _{0}}
to the RHS:

{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial ^{2}z'}{\partial t^{2}}}={\frac {g}{\rho _{0}}}{\frac {\partial \rho (z)}{\partial z}}z'}

{\displaystyle z'}
has oscillating solutions (and N gives our angular frequency). If it is positive, then there is run away growth – i.e. the fluid is statically unstable.
