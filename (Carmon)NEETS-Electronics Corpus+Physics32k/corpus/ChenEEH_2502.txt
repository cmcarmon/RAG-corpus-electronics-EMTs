In the following sections, unless otherwise speciﬁed, we refer
to the microstrip line or the rectangular waveguide as the basic
building block for passive components. Important aspects of
commonly used passive circuits are highlighted. Limited space
does not permit to introduce such useful principles and theo-
ries like the even–odd mode decoupling scheme, Kuroda iden-
tities, and Richards’s theorem (Pozar, 1998) that have been
developed for modeling, designing, and synthesizing passive
networks. For the relevant details, the reader is referred to the
appropriate literature.
