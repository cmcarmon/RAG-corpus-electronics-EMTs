Structural Properties of Matrices
In various applications, a matrix under consideration is known to have its elements functionally dependent on
a  relatively  small  set  of  parameters.  A  brief  listing  of  some  of  the  more  commonly  used  matrix  classes  so
characterized is given in Table 14.9. In each case, there exists a relatively simple relationship for the elements
