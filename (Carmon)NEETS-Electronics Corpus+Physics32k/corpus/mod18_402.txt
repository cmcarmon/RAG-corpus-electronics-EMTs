As shown in figure 2-31, a feedback loop is used from the output of the delay channel, through the
pickoff amplifier, to the trigger generator and gating multivibrator circuits. The leading edge of the square
wave produced by the detected carrier wave in the delayed video channel is differentiated at the pickoff
amplifier. It is used to activate the trigger generator and gating multivibrator. The trigger generator sends
an amplified trigger pulse to the modulator, causing the radar set to transmit.
