A second type of field-effect transistor has been introduced in recent years that has some advantages 
over the JFET. This device is the metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET). The 
MOSFET has an even higher input impedance than the JFET (10 to 100 million megohms). Therefore, 
the MOSFET is even less of a load on preceding circuits. The extremely high input impedance, combined 
with a high gain factor, makes the MOSFET a highly efficient input device for RF/IF amplifiers and 
mixers and for many types of test equipment.
