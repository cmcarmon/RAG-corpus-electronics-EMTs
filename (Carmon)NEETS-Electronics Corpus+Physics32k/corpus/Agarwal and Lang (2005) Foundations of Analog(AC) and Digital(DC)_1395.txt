The wave shapes in Figure 10.8 change very little if the input signal vI has zero
average value, that is, if vI is changed so that it jumps back and forth from −V/2
to +V/2. Specifically, vC also has zero average value, and if the transients go to
completion, as in wave forms b and c, the excursions will be −V/2 and +V/2.
