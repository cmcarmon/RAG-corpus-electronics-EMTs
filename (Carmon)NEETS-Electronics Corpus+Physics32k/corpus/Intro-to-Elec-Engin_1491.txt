• Discrete data are efﬁciently processed.
• Analog messages can also be converted to digital form.
• Digital systems interface well with computers.
• Digital systems offer great reliability and yield high performance at low cost.
• Being ﬂexible, digital systems can accommodate a variety of messages with ease.
• Security techniques are available to offer message privacy to users.
• Advanced signal-processing techniques can be added on.
However, the most serious disadvantages are the increased complexity needed for system
synchronization and the need for larger bandwidths than in an equivalent analog system. A
digital system can directly interface with a source having only discrete messages, because of
the inherent characteristic of the digital system. With suitable conversion methods, however,
systems currently exist that can simultaneously transmit audio, television, and digital data over
the same channel. Figure 14.1.2 illustrates the basic elements of a digital communication system,
which was introduced in Section 14.1.
