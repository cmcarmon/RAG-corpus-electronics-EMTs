The difference between ”scientiﬁc” and ”engineering” display modes is the difference be-
tween scientiﬁc and metric notation. In ”scientiﬁc” mode, the power-of-ten display is set so
that the main number on the display is always a value between 1 and 10 (or -1 and -10 for
negative numbers). In ”engineering” mode, the powers-of-ten are set to display in multiples of
3, to represent the major metric preﬁxes. All the user has to do is memorize a few preﬁx/power
combinations, and his or her calculator will be ”speaking” metric!
