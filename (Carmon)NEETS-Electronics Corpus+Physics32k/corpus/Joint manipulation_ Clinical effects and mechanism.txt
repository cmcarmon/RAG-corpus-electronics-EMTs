The clinical effects of joint manipulation have been shown to include:
Temporary relief of musculoskeletal pain.
Shortened time to recover from acute back sprains (Rand).
Temporary increase in passive range of motion (ROM).
Physiological effects upon the central nervous system.
No alteration of the position of the sacroiliac joint.
Common side effects of spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) are characterized as mild to moderate and may include: local discomfort, headache, tiredness, or radiating discomfort.
Shekelle (1994) summarised the published theories for mechanism(s) of action for how joint manipulation may exert its clinical effects as the following:
Release of entrapped synovial folds or plica
Relaxation of hypertonic muscle
Disruption of articular or periarticular adhesions
Unbuckling of motion segments that have undergone disproportionate displacement
