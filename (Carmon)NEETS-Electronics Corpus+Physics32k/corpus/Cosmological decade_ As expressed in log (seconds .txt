When CÐ is measured in log( seconds/Ð ), CÐ 1 begins at 10 seconds and lasts 90 seconds (until 100 seconds after Time Zero). CÐ 100, the 100th cosmological decade, lasts from 10100 to 10101 seconds after Time Zero. CÐ

is Time Zero.
The epoch CÐ −43.2683 was 10(−43.2683) seconds, which represents the Planck time since the big bang (Time Zero). There were an infinite number of cosmological decades between the Big Bang and the Planck epoch (or any other point in time). The current epoch, CÐ 17.6389, is 10(17.6389) seconds, or 13.799(21) billion years, since the Big Bang. There have been 60.9 cosmological decades between the Planck epoch, CÐ −43.2683, and the current epoch, CÐ 17.6389.
