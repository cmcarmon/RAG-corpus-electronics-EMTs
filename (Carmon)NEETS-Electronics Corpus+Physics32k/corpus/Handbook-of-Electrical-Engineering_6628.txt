ATM uses only cells; multiplexing and switching of cells is independent of the applications and of the bit
rates of the individual connections. Applying ATM technology, the idea of one universal integrated network
becomes  a  reality.  However,  the  ATM  technology  also  causes  some  problems.  Because  of  the  asynchronous
multiplexing  buffers  are  necessary,  which  results  in  cell  delay,  cell  delay  variation,  and  cell  loss.  In  order  to
compensate for these effects additional measures have to be provided.
