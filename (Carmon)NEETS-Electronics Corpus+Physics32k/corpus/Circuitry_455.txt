A practical Wien bridge oscillator is shown in Fig. 
9.14. This circuit produces a sine wave output at 16 
Hz.  The  output  frequency  can  easily  be  varied  by 
making Rl and R2 a l0 kL dual-gang potentiometer 
and connecting a fixed resistor of 680 L in series 
with  each.  In  order  to  adjust  the  loop  gain  for  an 
optimum sine  wave output it  may be  necessary to 
make R3/R4 adjustable. One way of doing this is to 
replace  both  components  with  a  10  kL multi-turn 
potentiometer with the sliding contact taken to the 
inverting input of IC1.
