Values of Io and Qo vary considerably with experimental parameters such as electrode size and location and
e also vary considerably with experimental conditions: a value around 250 ms
the size of the neuron. Values of t
is typical for both sensory and motor nerve excitation via cutaneous electrodes, and values around 125 ms are
observed for stimulation of axons by small electrodes. Much longer time constants are associated with direct
stimulation of muscle cells.
