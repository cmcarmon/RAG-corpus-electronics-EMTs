Having thus described my invention, what I claim as new is (1) The improvement in the art of compiling
statistics, which consists in ﬁrst preparing a series of separate record-cards, each card representing an indi-
vidual or subject; second, applying to each card at predetermined intervals circuit-controlling index points
arranged according to a ﬁxed plan of distribution, to represent each item or characteristic of the individual
or subject, and third, applying said separate record-cards successively to circuit-controlling devices acted upon
by  the  index-points  to  designate  each  statistical  item  represented  by  one  or  more  of  said  index-points,
substantially as described.
