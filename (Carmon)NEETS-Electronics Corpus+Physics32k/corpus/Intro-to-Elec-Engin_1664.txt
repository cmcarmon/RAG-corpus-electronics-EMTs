The manner in which output-rate damping effects in controlling the transient response are
most easily demonstrated is by assuming a step input applied to the system. The output-rate signal
appears in opposition to the proportional signal, thereby removing the tendency for an excessively
oscillatory response. With error-rate damping and output-rate damping, the damping ratio can be
seen to be
