Thin-Film Substrates
Another essential technology for optical networks is the thin-
ﬁlm substrate. By coating a thin glass or polymer substrate
with a thin interference ﬁlm of dielectric material, the substrate
can be made to pass through only a speciﬁc wavelength and
reﬂect all others. By integrating several of these components,
many optical network devices are created, including multiplex-
ers, demultiplexers, and add/drop devices.
