D/A  and  A/D  applications  have  evolved  from  predominately  military-driven  applications  to  consumer-
oriented applications. Up to the mid-1980s, the military applications determined the design of many D/A and
A/D  devices.  The  military  applications  required  very  high  performance  coupled  with  hermetic  packaging,
radiation hardening, shock and vibration testing, and military speciﬁcation and record keeping. Cost was of
little concern, and “low power” applications required approximately 2.8 W. The major applications up the mid-
1980s included military radar warning and guidance systems, digital oscilloscopes, medical imaging, infrared
systems, and professional video.
