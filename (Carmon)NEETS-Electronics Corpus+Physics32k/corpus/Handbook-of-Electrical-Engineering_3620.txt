The bianisotropic description of material has fundamental importance from the point of view of relativity.
The  principle  of  relativity  postulates  that  all  physical  laws  of  nature  must  be  characterized  by  mathematical
equations  that  are  form-invariant  from  one  observer  to  the  other.  For  electromagnetic  theory,  the  Maxwell
equations are form-invariant with respect to all observers, although the numerical values of the Ô¨Åeld quantities
may vary from one observer to another. The constitutive relations are form-invariant when they are written in
bianisotropic form.
