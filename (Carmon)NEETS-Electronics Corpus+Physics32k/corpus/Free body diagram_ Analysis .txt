A free body diagram is analyzed by summing all of the forces, often accomplished by summing the forces in each of the axis directions. When the net force is zero, the body must be at rest or must be moving at a constant velocity (constant speed and direction), by Newton's first law. If the net force is not zero, then the body is accelerating in that direction according to Newton's second law.
