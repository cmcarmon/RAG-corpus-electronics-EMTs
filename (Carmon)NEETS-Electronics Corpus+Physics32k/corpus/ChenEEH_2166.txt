. Ferromagnetic materials also have a positive wm, but the
resulting mr is usually much greater than 1. There is a
much stronger quantum mechanical interaction between
neighboring spin moments
than with paramagnetic
materials that can also lead to magnetization M without
an applied B. Ferromagnetism is strongly temperature
dependent. Only the elements iron, nickel, and cobalt
are ferromagnetic at
room temperature. Above the
Curie temperature Tc , a ferromagnetic material becomes
paramagnetic, and the magnetic susceptibility decreases
with increasing temperature. The Tc of the room tem-
perature ferromagnetic materials are 7708C for iron,
3548C for nickel, and 11158C for cobalt.
