In a properly functioning appliance (shown above), the current measured through the hot
conductor should be exactly equal to the current through the neutral conductor, because there’s
only one path for electrons to ﬂow in the circuit. With no fault inside the appliance, there is
no connection between circuit conductors and the person touching the case, and therefore no
shock.
