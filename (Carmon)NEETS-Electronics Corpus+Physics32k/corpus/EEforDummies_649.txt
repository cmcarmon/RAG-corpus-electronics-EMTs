Identifying transistors
Many bipolar transistors originating in North America are identified by a 
five‐ or six‐digit code that is part of an industry‐standard semiconductor iden-
tification system. The first two digits are always 2N for transistors, with the 2 
specifying the number of pn‐junctions and the N signifying a semiconductor.
