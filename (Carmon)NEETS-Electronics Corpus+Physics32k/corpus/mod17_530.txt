Antenna pointing instructions for each satellite must be computed separately for each ground station 
location. A satellite that bears due south of station A at an elevation of 25 degrees may simultaneously 
bear due southeast of station B at an elevation of 30 degrees. Antenna pointing instructions are 
determined by taking into consideration the orbital prediction and the latitude and longitude of each 
ground station.
