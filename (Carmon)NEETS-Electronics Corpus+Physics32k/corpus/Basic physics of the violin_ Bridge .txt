The bridge supports one end of the strings' playing length. It must stand up under a combined down force of about 20 lbf (89 N). Down force preloads the violin's top, or table, affecting the sound of a sensitive instrument. String break angle across the bridge affects the down force, and is typically 158Â°.
More importantly, the bridge transfers vibration from the strings to the top of the violin. The most significant bridge motion is side-to-side rocking, coming from the transverse component of the strings' vibration. The bridge may be usefully viewed as a mechanical filter, or an arrangement of masses and "springs" that filters and shapes the timbre of the sound. Often the bridge is shaped to emphasize the singers' formant at about 3000 Hz.
