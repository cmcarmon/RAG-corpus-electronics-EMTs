Norton’s theorem: At a pair of terminals a linear electrical network can be replaced with a current source in
parallel with an admittance. The current source is equal to the current that ﬂows through the terminals
when the terminals are short-circuited. The admittance is equal to the admittance at the terminals with
all independent sources set equal to zero.
