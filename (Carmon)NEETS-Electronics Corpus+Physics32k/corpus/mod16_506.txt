Placing the MODE switch in figure 4-16 to the AC position connects the instrument circuitry as a
conventional transistorized ac voltmeter. A full-scale input voltage at the input terminals of the instrument
results in a voltage being applied to the input of the null detector. The null detector drives the front panel
meter that indicates the value of the measured ac voltage.
