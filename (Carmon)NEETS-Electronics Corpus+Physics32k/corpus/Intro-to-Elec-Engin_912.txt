The rated core loss can be approximated by the power input in the open-circuit test in which
one winding is open-circuited and rated voltage at rated frequency is applied to the other winding.
The rated copper loss (at full load) can be approximated by the power input in the short-circuit
test, in which one winding is short-circuited and a reduced voltage at rated frequency is applied
to the other winding such that the rated current results.
