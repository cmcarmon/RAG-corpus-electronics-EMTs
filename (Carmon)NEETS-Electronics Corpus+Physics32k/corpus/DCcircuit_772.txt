The unit shown above is typical of a handheld analog multimeter, with ranges for voltage,
current, and resistance measurement. Note the many scales on the face of the meter movement
for the different ranges and functions selectable by the rotary switch. The wires for connecting
this instrument to a circuit (the ”test leads”) are plugged into the two copper jacks (socket
holes) at the bottom-center of the meter face marked ”- TEST +”, black and red.
