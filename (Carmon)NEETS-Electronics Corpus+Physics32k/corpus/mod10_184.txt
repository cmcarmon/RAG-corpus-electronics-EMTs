When current flows through a conductor, a magnetic field is set up in the area surrounding the
conductor. In fact, any moving electrical charge will create a magnetic field. The magnetic field is a
region in space where a magnetic force can be detected and measured. There are two other fields
involvedâ€”an INDUCTION FIELD, which exists close to the conductor carrying the current, and the
RADIATION FIELD, which becomes detached from the current-carrying rod and travels through space.
