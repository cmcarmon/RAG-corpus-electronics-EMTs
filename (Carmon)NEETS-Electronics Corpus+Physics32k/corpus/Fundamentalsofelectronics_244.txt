This circuit diﬀers from the one shown previously (Figure 3.27) in that the resistor R2 has been added across
the output. What eﬀect has it had on the transfer function, which in the original circuit was a lowpass ﬁlter
? As shown in Figure 3.35, adding the second resistor has two eﬀects:
having cutoﬀ frequency fc =
it lowers the gain in the passband (the range of frequencies for which the ﬁlter has little eﬀect on the input)
and increases the cutoﬀ frequency.
