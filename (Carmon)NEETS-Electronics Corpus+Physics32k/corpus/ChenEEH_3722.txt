and Markel, 1979). If we let x^aa be the total squared error
incurred in predicting X using ^aa and x^bb be the total squared
error in predicting X using ^bb, then it is not difﬁcult to show
that dl(^aa, ^bb) ¼ log (x^bb=x^aa); hence, the measure gives an indi-
cation of how ‘‘far’’ from optimal is the estimate of ^bb. The
Itakura distance is always positive because the denominator
yields the smallest possible value of x.
