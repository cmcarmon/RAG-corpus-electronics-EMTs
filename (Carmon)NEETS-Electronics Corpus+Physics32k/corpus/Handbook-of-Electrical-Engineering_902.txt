Example 13.2.
 Here, we ﬁnd the gain, bandwidth, input impedance,
and output noise of a cascode ampliﬁer. The circuit for the ampliﬁer is shown in Fig. 13.5. The circuit is assumed
to be fabricated in a monolithic IC process, so it will be necessary to consider some of the parasitics of the IC
process. A cross-section of a typical IC bipolar transistor is shown in Fig. 13.4 along with some of the parasitic
elements. These parasitic elements are easily included in the ampliﬁer by creating a “macro model” for each
transistor. The macro model is then implemented in SPICE form using subcircuits.
