The same amount of current must always be used to deflect the pointer to a certain position on the
scale (midscale position, for example), regardless of the multiplication factor being used. Since the
multiplier resistors are of different values, you must always "zero" the meter for each multiplication scale
selected. When selecting a range on the ohmmeter, select the one that will result in the pointer coming to
rest as close to the midpoint of the scale as possible. This will enable you to read the resistance more
accurately because scale readings are more easily interpreted at or near midpoint.
