Sometimes an open can be located visually by a close inspection of the circuit components.
Defective components, such as burned out resistors, can usually be discovered by this method. Others,
such as a break in wire covered by insulation or the melted element of an enclosed fuse, are not visible to
the eye. Under such conditions, the understanding of the effect an open has on circuit conditions enables a
technician to make use of test equipment to locate the open component.
