Sufﬁce it to say, intentional direct short-circuits across the terminals of any voltage source
is a bad idea. Even if the resulting high current (heat, ﬂashes, sparks) causes no harm to
people nearby, the voltage source will likely sustain damage, unless it has been speciﬁcally
designed to handle short-circuits, which most voltage sources are not.
