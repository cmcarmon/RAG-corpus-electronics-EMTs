The method of moments, also known as the moment
method, is one of the numerical methods developed to rise
up to the challenge of solving increasingly complex problems
in electromagnetics. It transforms the governing equation of a
boundary-value problem into a matrix equation to enable its
solution on a digital computer. Although the basic mathemat-
ical concepts of the moment method were in existence during
early 20th century, true interest in it did not arise until the
mid-1960s, with the publication of pioneering work by Mei
and Van Bladel (1963), Andreasen (1964), Oshiro (1965), and
Richmond (1968). The uniÔ¨Åed formulation of the method was
presented by Harrington in his seminal book in 1968. Since
then, the method has been further developed and applied to a
variety of important electromagnetic problems. It has become
one of the dominant methods in computational electromag-
netics. It is not our intent here to present a complete history
and list of references on the method. The reader is referred to
Miller (1992) for a 35-page bibliography of the journal articles
from 1960 to 1990. This book also presents a selection of key
