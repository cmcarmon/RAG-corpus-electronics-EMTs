The losses are made up of rotational losses (3 to 15%), armature-circuit copper losses (3 to 6%),
and shunt-Ô¨Åeld copper losses (1 to 5%). Figure 13.4.13 shows the schematic diagram of a dc
machine, along with the power division in a generator and a motor. The resistance voltage drop,
also known as arc drop, between brushes and commutator is generally assumed constant at 2
V, and the brush-contact loss is therefore calculated as 2Ia. In such a case, the resistance of the
armature circuit should not include the resistance between brushes and commutator.
