DO remember to align the trace with the X-axis of 
the  graticule  with  the  input  selector  set  to  ‘GND’ 
prior to taking DC offset measurements. 
 
DO  make  use  of  the  built-in  calibrator  facility  to 
check the accuracy of the attenuator and the ‘CAL’ 
setting of the variable gain control. 
 
DO  use  properly  screened  leads  and  a  suitable 
probe 
the  circuit  under 
investigation. 
 
DO check that you have made a proper connection 
to ground or 0 V prior to taking measurements. 
 
DON’T  leave  the  intensity  control  set  at  a  high 
level for any length of time. 
 
DON’T leave a bright spot on the display for even 
the  shortest  time  (this  may  burn  the  phosphor 
coating of the screen). 
 
DON’T  rely  on  voltage  measurements  on  circuits 
where  high-frequency  signals  may  be  outside  the 
bandwidth of the oscilloscope. 
 
DON’T forget to set the a.c.-d.c.-gnd switch to the 
d.c. position when making measurements of the d.c. 
offset present on a.c. signals. 
 
DON’T  place  the  oscilloscope  where  there  is  a 
strong 
local  magnetic  field.  This  may  cause 
unwanted deflection of electron beam!
