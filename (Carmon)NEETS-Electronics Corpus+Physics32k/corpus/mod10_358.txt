Neither the muf nor the luf is a practical operating frequency. While radio waves at the luf can be 
refracted back to Earth at the desired location, the signal-to-noise ratio is still much lower than at the 
higher frequencies, and the probability of multipath propagation is much greater. Operating at or near the 
muf can result in frequent signal fading and dropouts when ionospheric variations alter the length of the 
transmission path.
