types of elements in the formulation. The circuit stamps for
other common elements are given in Table 3.1 and can be
found in CAD books. In this table, rows labeled with lowercase
letters j, k, l, and m represent KCL equations at that node, and
Vj, Vk, Vl, and Vm represent nodal voltages at the corre-
sponding nodes. All rows and columns labeled by a current I
represent additional rows and columns required for MNA.
