There exist additional possibilities on how to couple the vari-
ables. They can be found in any textbook on network theory.
For demonstration, we use the network in Figure 4.5 and
derive its zij parameters. We attach a voltage source V1 on the
left and nothing on the right. This means that I2 ¼ 0, and the
voltage V2 appears in the middle of the network as indicated.
We see that V1 ¼ (Z1 þ Z3)I1 and z11 ¼ V1=I1 ¼ Z1 þ Z3. In
addition, since the voltage in the middle of the network is V2,
we can write V2 ¼ I1Z3 and z21 ¼ V2=I1 ¼ Z3. In the next step,
we place the voltage source on the right and proceed similarly.
The result is:
