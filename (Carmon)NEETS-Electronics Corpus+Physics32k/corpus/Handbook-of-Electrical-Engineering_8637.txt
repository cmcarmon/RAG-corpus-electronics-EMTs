This  register  (which  is  a  general  register  on  the VAX  but  a  special  register  on  the
other  machines)  points  to  the  place  (memory  location)  in  the  machine  language
instruction stream where the program is currently operating. As each instruction is
fetched,  the  PC  is  automatically  incremented.  The  action  of  the  JSR  is  to  save  the
last version of the PC—the one for the next fetch—and replace it with the starting
address of the routine to be jumped to.
