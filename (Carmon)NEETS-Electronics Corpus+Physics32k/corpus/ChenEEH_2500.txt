The simplest form of a passive component is a section of
transmission line bounded by certain impedance conditions,
including short and open (electrically). The transmission line
may be a planar structure, a quasiplanar structure, or a
nonplanar waveguide. These three basic categories of trans-
mission lines form the foundation for designing a microwave
passive component.
