The LPV synthesis conditions described here make use of a
ﬁxed Lyapunov function (as opposed to one that depends on
the scheduling variables) to characterize stability and perfor-
mance. Such approaches are potentially conservative because
they allow for arbitrary rates of variation in the scheduling
variables, a generalization that may render the synthesis
conditions infeasible. A signiﬁcant improvement over such
techniques can be obtained by exploiting the concept of param-
eter-dependent Lyapunov functions. Parameter-dependent
Lyapunov functions allow incorporation of knowledge on the
parameter variation rate into the analysis or synthesis technique
and can lead to less conservative answers. Implementation of
solutions based on parameter-dependent Lyapunov functions
require not only the real-time measurement of the parameter
but also its time derivative. This is generally prohibitive because
such values are either unavailable or difﬁcult to estimate in real-
time. Generally speaking, there is no systematic rule for
selecting the functional dependence of the Laypunov function
on the parameter. The key idea is to mimic the parameter
dependence of the plant in the Lyapunov function variables.
