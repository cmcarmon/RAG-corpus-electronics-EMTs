I/O program control statements, e.g., transfer in channel, are interpreted by the channel, while the storage
director (also known as the device controller or control unit) handles seek and data-transfer requests. Besides
these control functions, it may also perform certain datapath functions, such as error detection/correction and
mapping  between  serial  and  parallel  data.  In  response  to  requests  from  the  storage  director,  the  device  will
position the access mechanism, select the appropriate head, and perform the read or write. If the storage director
is simply a control unit, then the datapath functions will be handled by the head of string (also known as a
string controller).
