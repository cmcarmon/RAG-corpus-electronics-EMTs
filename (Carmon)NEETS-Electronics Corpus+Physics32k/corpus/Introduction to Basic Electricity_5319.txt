Many problems have simple solutions. When trou-
bleshooting, do not immediately assume a problem is 
complex. It could be a bad connection or a blown fuse. 
Remember that problems with the most impact usually 
have the simplest solutions. Difficult problems to solve 
are those that are intermittent or hard to reproduce.
