1. The dependence of the bus voltage V on the load P is
very much nonlinear. It has been possible for us to
compute the power ï¬‚ow solutions analytically for this
simple system. In the large power system with hun-
dreds of generators delivering power to thousands of
loads, we have to solve for thousands of bus voltages
and their phase angles from large coupled sets of non-
