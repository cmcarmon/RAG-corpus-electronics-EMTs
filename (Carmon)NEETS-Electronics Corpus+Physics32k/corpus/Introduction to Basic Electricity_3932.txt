A factor that limits the high-frequency response in 
a transistor amplifier is the shunt capacitance of the 
circuit. A small capacitance exists between the junc-
tions of the transistor. The capacitance is determined 
by the size of the junction and the spacing between the 
transistorâ€™s leads. The capacitance is further affected 
by the junction bias. A forward-biased base-emitter 
junction has a greater capacitance than a reverse- 
biased collector-base junction.
