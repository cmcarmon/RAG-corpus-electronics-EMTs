A limiter is little more than the half-wave rectifier you studied in NEETS, Module 6, Introduction to 
Electronic Emission, Tubes, and Power Supplies. By using a diode, a resistor, and sometimes a dc bias 
voltage, you can build a limiter that will eliminate the positive or negative alternations of an input 
waveform. Such a circuit can also limit a portion of the alternations to a specific voltage level. In this 
chapter you will be introduced to five types of limiters: SERIES-POSITIVE, SERIES-NEGATIVE, 
PARALLEL-POSITIVE, PARALLEL-NEGATIVE, and DUAL-DIODE LIMITERS. Both series- and 
parallel-positive and negative limiters use biasing to obtain certain wave shapes. They will be discussed in 
this chapter.
