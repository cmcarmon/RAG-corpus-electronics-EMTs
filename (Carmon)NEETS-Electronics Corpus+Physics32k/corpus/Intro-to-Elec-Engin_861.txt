Total power ﬂow on these lines had been 1600 MW into Ontario, including 500 MW being
imported from the Power Authority of the State of New York. All this power was suddenly
dumped on the New York system. The resultant surge knocked out the Power Authority’s
main east–west transmission line and shut down seven units that had been feeding the north-
eastern grid. The resulting drain on systems to the south and east caused the whole system to
collapse.
