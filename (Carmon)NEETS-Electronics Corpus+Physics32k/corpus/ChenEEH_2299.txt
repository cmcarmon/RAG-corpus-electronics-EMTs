Equation 4.7 represents an incident wave traveling from the
generator toward the load, and it remains valid on an inﬁnitely
long line, in which case there is no reﬂected wave. We can
obtain some insight into wave propagation along the line by
plotting the voltage as a function of phase delay bz for a ﬁxed
time variable vt. Figure 4.5 shows three progression stages of
the voltage waveform.
As time progresses from t ¼ 0 to t ¼ t1 and then to t ¼ t2,
the reference voltage sample at the waveform’s peak moves
along the positive z direction from location z ¼ 0 to z1 to z2,
for example. This is true for every point on the waveform. In
fact, there is a constant phase delay, bDz ¼ vDt , between
successive snapshots. Since v and b are constant, it means
that as time increases by Dt, the position of the reference
sample is proportionately displaced along positive z direction
