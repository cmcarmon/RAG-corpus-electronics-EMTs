and return later to unscramble the cosine and sine parts. In this equation we
have used
s1 as a shorthand for jω1,
and have included a ‘‘˜’’ above vi to indicate that this is not the true drive voltage.
For consistency, we will use the same notation for all variables related to this
fake drive voltage. The differential equation to find the particular solution to ˜vi
now becomes
