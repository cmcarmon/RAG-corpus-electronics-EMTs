Much of what you have learned about resonance and series-LC circuits can be applied directly to 
parallel-LC circuits. The purpose of the two circuits is the same â€” to select a specific frequency and 
reject all others. XL still equals XC at resonance. Because the inductor and capacitor are in parallel, 
however, the circuit has the basic characteristics of an a.c. parallel circuit. The parallel hookup causes
