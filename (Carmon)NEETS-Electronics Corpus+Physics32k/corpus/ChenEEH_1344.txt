The advantage of CC-NUMA over a standard SMP design is
that there are several local busses, so each one need not carry
all transactions occurring throughout the system. This in turn
means that a larger number of processors can be used than in
the equivalent SMP design, allowing a greater level of parallel-
ism. The Sequent NUMA-Q system can support over two
hundred Pentium II processors. CC-NUMA has a clear advan-
tage over clusters of communicating computers—because the
nonlocal memory accesses and cache coherence is maintained
automatically, it is a much easier process to port software
developed for an SMP to a CC-NUMA system than to a
cluster. In addition, the programming paradigm is signiﬁcantly
simpler.
