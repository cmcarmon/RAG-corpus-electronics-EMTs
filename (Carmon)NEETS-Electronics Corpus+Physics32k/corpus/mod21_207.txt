Because of the reliability of semiconductor devices, servicing techniques developed for
transistorized equipment differ from those used for electron-tube circuits. Electron tubes are usually
considered to be the circuit component most susceptible to failure and are normally the first to be tested.
Transistors, however, are capable of operating in excess of 30,000 hours at maximum ratings without
appreciable degradation. They are often soldered into equipment in the same manner as resistors and
capacitors. Substitution of a diode or transistor known to be in good condition is a simple method of
determining the quality of a questionable semiconductor device. You should use this technique only after
voltage and resistance measurements indicate that no circuit defect exists that might damage the
substituted semiconductor device. If more than one defective semiconductor is present in the equipment
section where trouble has been localized, substitution becomes cumbersome since several semiconductors
may have to be replaced before the trouble is corrected. To determine which stages failed and which
semiconductors are not defective, you must test all of the removed semiconductors. This can be
accomplished by observing whether the equipment operates correctly as each of the removed
semiconductor devices is reinserted into the equipment.
