An oscillator is a circuit that generates a  repetitive 
AC signal. The frequency of the AC signal may vary 
from a few hertz to many millions of hertz. The 
 oscillator is an alternative to the mechanical  generator 
used to produce electrical power. The advantages of 
the  oscillator are the absence of moving parts and the 
range over which the AC signal can be  produced. The 
 output of an oscillator may be a sinusoidal,  rectangular, 
or  sawtooth waveform, depending on the type of 
 oscillator used. The main requirement of an oscillator 
is that the  output be uniform; that is, the output must 
not vary in either frequency or amplitude.
