An ATM LAN consists of a switch into which are wired end users in a star-type topology. There are several
possibilities for the internal architecture of the switch. A low-cost switch may essentially be a computer bus in
a  box.  More  sophisticated  switches  may  use  switching  fabrics.  These  are  very  large-scale  integrated  (VLSI)
implementations of patterned networks of simple switching elements, sometimes referred to as space division
switching. A great deal of effort has gone into producing cost-effective ATM switches over the past 12 years. It
should be pointed out that many of the issues that are not yet resolved for wide area network ATM (i.e., trafÔ¨Åc
policing, billing) are more tractable in the private ATM LAN environment.
