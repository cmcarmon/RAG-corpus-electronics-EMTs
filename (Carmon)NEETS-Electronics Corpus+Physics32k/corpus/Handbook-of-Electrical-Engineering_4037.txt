The frequency spectral content should be designed for the speciﬁc needs of the circuit, minimizing interfer-
ence by constraining signals to desired paths, eliminating undesired paths, and separating signals from inter-
ference. Interference control is also achieved by physically separating leads carrying currents from different sources.
For  optimum  control,  the  three  major  methods  of  EMI  suppression—grounding,  shielding,  and  ﬁlter-
ing—should  be  incorporated  early  in  the  design  process.  The  control  of  EMI  is  ﬁrst  achieved  by  proper
grounding, then by good shielding design, and ﬁnally by ﬁltering.
