Regular triangular coordinates are in a grid of equilateral triangles and are of the form



(
x
,
y
,
z
)


{\displaystyle (x,y,z)}
such that



x
,
y
,
z


{\displaystyle x,y,z}
are equal to or greater than 0.
Regular tetrahedral coordinates are in a Euclidean 3-space 'grid' of equilateral tetrahedra and are of the form



(
w
,
x
,
y
,
z
)


{\displaystyle (w,x,y,z)}
such that



w
,
x
,
y
,
z


{\displaystyle w,x,y,z}
are equal to or greater than 0.
