The analog capacitive system uses the same metallic overlay, but
the metallic surface is continuous rather than etched. The connec-
tions at the four ends are each connected to a separate oscillator,
and the frequency of each is measured and stored. Then when the
overlay is touched the change in capacitance will have a different
effect on the frequency of each oscillator. These are measured and
the differences are used to determine the coordinates of the touch
by means of an algorithm. This technique is capable of much higher
resolution (250 Â· 250) than the digital approach and is preferred for graphics or other high-density displays.
