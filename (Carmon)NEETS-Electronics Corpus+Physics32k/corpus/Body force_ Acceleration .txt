Like any other force, a body force will cause an object to accelerate. For a non-rigid object, Newton's second law applied to a small volume element is





f

(

r

)
=
ρ
(

r

)

g

(

r

)


{\displaystyle \mathbf {f} (\mathbf {r} )=\rho (\mathbf {r} )\mathbf {g} (\mathbf {r} )}
,
where ρ(r) is the mass density of the substance, ƒ the force density, and a(r) all at point r.
In the case of gravity on a planet surface, g(r) is simply the approximately constant and uniform gravitational field, like on Earth where:

{\displaystyle g=9.81{\frac {\mathrm {m} }{\mathrm {s} ^{2}}}}
