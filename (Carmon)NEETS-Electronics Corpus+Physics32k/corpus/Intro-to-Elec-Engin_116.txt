Oscilloscope
To measure time-varying signals (voltages and currents), an instrument known as an oscilloscope
is employed. It can be used as a practical electronic voltmeter which displays a graph of voltage
as a function of time. Such a display allows one not only to read off the voltage at any instant of
time, but also to observe the general behavior of the voltage as a function of time. The horizontal
and vertical scales of the display are set by the oscilloscopeâ€™s controls, such as 5 ms per each
horizontal division and 50 V per each vertical division. For periodic waveforms, the moving
light spot repeatedly graphs the same repetitive shape, and the stationary waveform is seen. For
nonperiodic cases, a common way of handling is to cause the oscilloscope to make only one single
graph, representing the voltage over a single short time period. This is known as single-sweep
operation. Since the display lasts for only a very short time, it may be photographed for later
inspection.
