The flow velocity of a fluid is a vector field which is used to mathematically describe the motion of a continuum. The length of the flow velocity vector is the flow speed and is a scalar. The flow velocity




u



{\displaystyle \mathbf {u} }
of a fluid is a vector field





u

=

u

(
x
,
y
,
z
,
t
)
,


{\displaystyle \mathbf {u} =\mathbf {u} (x,y,z,t),}

which gives the velocity of an element of fluid at a position



(
x
,
y
,
z
)



{\displaystyle (x,y,z)\,}
and time



t
.



{\displaystyle t.\,}
The Lambda2 method determines for any point




u



{\displaystyle \mathbf {u} }
in the fluid whether this point is part of a vortex core. A vortex is now defined as a connected region for which every point inside this region is part of a vortex core.
Usually one will also obtain a large number of small vortices when using the above definition. In order to detect only real vortices, a threshold can be used to discard any vortices below a certain size (e.g. volume or number of points contained in the vortex).
