The diameter of conductors used in electronics is often only a fraction of an inch, therefore, the
diameter is expressed in mils (thousandths of an inch). It is also standard practice to assign the unit
circular mil to the cross-sectional area of the conductor. The circular mil is found by squaring the
diameter when the diameter is expressed in mils. Thus, if the diameter is 35 mils (0.035 inch), the circular
