 
Most  electronic  circuits  can  be  represented  as  a  system  with  an  input  and  an 
output as shown in Figure 1.10. The input signal is typically a voltage that is generated by 
a sensor or by another circuit. The output signal is also often a voltage and is used to 
power an actuator or transmit signals to another circuit.
