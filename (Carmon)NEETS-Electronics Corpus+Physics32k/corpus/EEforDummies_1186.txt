One of the top benefits of a multimeter is that it can help you analyze the 
rights and wrongs of your circuits. By using the various test settings, you 
can verify the viability of individual components and confirm that voltages 
and currents are what they should be. Sooner or later, you hook up a circuit 
that doesn’t work right away — but your multimeter can help you sniff out 
the problem if you can’t resolve the problem by physically checking all your 
 connections.
