The sign of the stream function depends on the definition used.
One way is to define the stream function



ψ


{\displaystyle \psi }
for a two-dimensional flow such that the flow velocity can be expressed through the vector potential




ψ

:


{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\psi }}:}






u

=
∇
×

ψ



{\displaystyle \mathbf {u} =\nabla \times {\boldsymbol {\psi }}}

Where




ψ

=
(
0
,
0
,
ψ
)


{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\psi }}=(0,0,\psi )}
if the flow velocity vector




u

=
(
u
,
v
,
0
)


{\displaystyle \mathbf {u} =(u,v,0)}
.
In Cartesian coordinate system this is equivalent to




u
=



∂
ψ


∂
y



,

v
=
−



∂
ψ


∂
x





{\displaystyle u={\frac {\partial \psi }{\partial y}},\qquad v=-{\frac {\partial \psi }{\partial x}}}

Where



u


{\displaystyle u}
and



v


{\displaystyle v}
are the flow velocity components in the cartesian



x


{\displaystyle x}
and



y


{\displaystyle y}
coordinate directions, respectively.
