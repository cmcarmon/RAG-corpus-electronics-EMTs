The three-phase input voltage to the stator of figure 4-4 is shown in the graph of figure 4-5. Use the
left-hand rule for determining the electromagnetic polarity of the poles at any given instant. In applying
the rule to the coils in figure 4-4, consider that current flows toward the terminal numbers for positive
voltages, and away from the terminal numbers for negative voltages.
