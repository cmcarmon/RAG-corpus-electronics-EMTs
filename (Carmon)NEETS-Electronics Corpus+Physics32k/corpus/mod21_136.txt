Certain special tests require the use of a continuously adjustable auxiliary power supply. By pressing
pushbutton S302B, you may use meter M301 to read the voltage of the auxiliary power supply on meter
M301. This voltage may be adjusted by the use of the potentiometer R142. The rest of the potentiometer
controls are calibration controls and are adjusted by the use of special calibration cards and a calibration
test cell.
