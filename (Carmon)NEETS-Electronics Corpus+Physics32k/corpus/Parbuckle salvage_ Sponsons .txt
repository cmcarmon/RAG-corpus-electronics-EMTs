Eleven steel sponsons were installed on the port side of the hull: two long horizontal sponsons; two long vertical sponsons and seven short vertical sponsons.
Each long horizontal sponson
measured 33 by 11.5 by 10.5 meters (108 by 38 by 34 ft),
weighed about 540 metric tons (600 short tons),
provided 3,600 cubic meters (4,700 cubic yards) of buoyancy.

Each long vertical sponson
measured 33 by 11.5 by 10.5 meters (108 by 38 by 34 ft),
weighed of about 523 metric tons (577 short tons),
provided about 3,600 cubic meters (4,700 cubic yards) of buoyancy.

Each short vertical sponson
measured 21.8 by 11.5 by 10.5 meters (72 by 38 by 34 ft),
weighed about 400 metric tons (440 short tons),
provided about 2,400 cubic meters (3,100 cubic yards) of buoyancy.

Two steel "blister" tanks were connected together at the hull's bow. They measured 23 meters (75 feet) in length, 20 meters (66 feet) in height each, and had a total breadth of about 36 meters (118 feet). The whole blister structure (the two blister tanks, the tubular frame and the three anchor pipes) weighed about 1,700 metric tons (1,900 short tons). They provided a net buoyancy of 4,500 metric tons (5,000 short tons) to the bow section.
