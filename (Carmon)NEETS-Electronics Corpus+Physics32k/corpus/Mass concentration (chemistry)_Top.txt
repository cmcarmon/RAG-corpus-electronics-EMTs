In chemistry, the mass concentration ρi (or γi) is defined as the mass of a constituent mi divided by the volume of the mixture V:

{\displaystyle \rho _{i}={\frac {m_{i}}{V}}.}

For a pure chemical the mass concentration equals its density (mass divided by volume); thus the mass concentration of a component in a mixture can be called the density of a component in a mixture. This explains the usage of ρ (the lower case Greek letter rho), the symbol most often used for density.
