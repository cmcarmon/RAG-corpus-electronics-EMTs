There is also a similar consideration in the movement of the metacentre forward and aft as a ship pitches. Metacentres are usually separately calculated for transverse (side to side) rolling motion and for lengthwise longitudinal pitching motion. These are variously known as






G

M

T

{\displaystyle {\overline {GM_{T}}}}
and






G

{\displaystyle {\overline {GM_{L}}}}
, GM(t) and GM(l), or sometimes GMt and GMl .
Technically, there are different metacentric heights for any combination of pitch and roll motion, depending on the moment of inertia of the waterplane area of the ship around the axis of rotation under consideration, but they are normally only calculated and stated as specific values for the limiting pure pitch and roll motion.
