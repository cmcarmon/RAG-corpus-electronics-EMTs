FIGURE 113.1
Functional components of (a) motor and (b) sensory neurons. Arrows indicate the direction of information
ï¬‚ow.  Signals  are  propagated  across  synapses  via  chemical  neurotransmitters  and  elsewhere  by  membrane  depolarization.
Synapses are inside the spinal column. The sizes of the components are drawn on a distorted scale to emphasize various
features.
