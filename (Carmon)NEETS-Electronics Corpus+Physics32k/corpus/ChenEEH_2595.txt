A band-pass ﬁlter may also be called a band-select ﬁlter as it
selects a speciﬁc frequency range to pass a signal unattenuated.
This type of ﬁlter is the most frequently used. Band-pass ﬁlters
may be built from all common transmission line media,
ranging from waveguide to microstrip line. A basic feature of
the geometry of a band-pass ﬁlter is that it may consist of
resonators coupled along the transmission path of signal, and
its number of poles is related to the number of resonant modes
of the ﬁlter.
