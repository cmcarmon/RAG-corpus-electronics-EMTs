In  the  classical  approach,  the  objective  is  to  calculate  the  potential  and  the  carrier  distribution  inside  the
device. Poisson’s equation is solved to yield the potential distribution inside the device from which the electric
ﬁeld can be approximated. The electric ﬁeld distribution is then used in the current continuity equations to
obtain the carrier distribution and the current densities. The diffusion coefﬁcients and carrier mobilities are
usually ﬁeld as well as spatially dependent.
