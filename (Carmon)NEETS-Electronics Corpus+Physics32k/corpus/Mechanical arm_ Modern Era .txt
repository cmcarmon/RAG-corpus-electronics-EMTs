As time passed, limb design started to focus on people's specialties as well. For example, a pianist would need a different type of mechanical arm than others. Their limbs would be widespread and their middle and ring fingers would be smaller than normal. In addition, an arm design of padded tips on the thumb and little finger would allow a pianist to span a series of notes while playing their instrument.
Technology for the prosthetic limbs kept evolving after World War I. After the war, laborers would return to work, using either legs or the arms because of its ability to grip objects. This is one of the designs that remains unchanged over the past century. People with such prosthetics would do everyday things like driving a car, eating food, and much more.
