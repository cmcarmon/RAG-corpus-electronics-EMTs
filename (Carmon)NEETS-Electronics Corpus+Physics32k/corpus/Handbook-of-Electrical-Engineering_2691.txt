An important goal in ﬂoorplanning is the cell sizing problem where the goal is to determine the dimensions
of variable cells whose area is invariant. All cells are assumed to be rectangular, and in the cell sizing problem
the goal is to determine the width and height of each cell subject to predetermined upper and lower bounds
on their ratio, and to their product being equal to its area, so that the ﬁnal ﬂoorplan has optimal area.
