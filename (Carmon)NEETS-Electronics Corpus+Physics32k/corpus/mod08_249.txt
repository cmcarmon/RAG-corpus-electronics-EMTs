Optimum coupling will usually provide the necessary bandpass for the frequency-determining
network (and therefore the rf amplifier). For some uses, such as rf amplifiers in a television receiver, the
bandpass available from optimum coupling is not wide enough. In these cases, a swamping resistor (as
mentioned earlier) will be used with the optimum coupling to broaden the bandpass.
