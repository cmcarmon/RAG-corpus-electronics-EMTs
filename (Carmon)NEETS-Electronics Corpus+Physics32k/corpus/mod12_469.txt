After the electron beam passes the limiter grid, the screen grid refocuses the beam toward the
quadrature grid. The quadrature grid acts much the same as the limiter grid; it either opens or closes the
passage for electrons. These two grids act similar to an AND gate in digital devices; both gates must be
open for the passage of electrons to the plate. Either grid can cut off plate current. AND gates were
presented in NEETS, Module 13, Introduction to Number Systems, Boolean Algebra, and Logic Circuits.
