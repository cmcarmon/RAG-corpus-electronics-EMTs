Remove the end of the jumper wire that you connected in Step 2 and 
just let it hang. Observe the voltage reading on your meter. Your meter 
should continue to read 9Â V or thereabouts. (You may see the reading 
decrease a tiny bit, as the capacitor discharges slowly through the inter-
nal resistance of your meter.) The capacitor is holding its charge (really, 
storing electrical energy), even without the battery connected.
