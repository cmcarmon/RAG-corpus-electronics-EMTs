If the beam of light and mirror arrangement is used, the beam of light is swept to the right or left
across a translucent screen (scale). The translucent screen is divided uniformly with the zero reading
located at center scale. If the pointer arrangement is used, the pointer is moved in a horizontal plane to the
right or left across a scale that is divided uniformly with the zero reading at the center. The direction in
which the beam of light or the pointer moves depends on the direction (polarity) of current through the
coil.
