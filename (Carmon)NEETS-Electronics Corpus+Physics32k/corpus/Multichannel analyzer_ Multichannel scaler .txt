In multichannel scaler (MCS) mode, the pulses are counted in a given time period, and in the channel the pulses are input as changes over time (rather than with amplitude as in PHA mode). The trigger for changing channel can be used for changing other parameters of an experiment, allowing an MCA to be used as an Xâ€“Y recorder. This mode can be used in conjunction with a Geiger counter to see a change in radioactivity over time.
