▶✓ In a dynamic microphone, the diaphragm is attached to a movable 
induction coil located inside a permanent magnet. As sound moves 
the diaphragm, the coil moves inside the magnetic field produced by 
the magnet, and a current is induced in the coil. (Chapter 8 has the 
lowdown on this phenomenon, which is known as electromagnetic 
induction.)
