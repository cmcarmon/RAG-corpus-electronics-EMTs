The term Fermi point has two applications but refers to the same phenomena (special relativity):
Fermi point (Quantum Field Theory)
Fermi point (Nanotechnology)
For both applications count that the symmetry between particles and anti-particles in weak interactions is violated:At this point the particle energy E = cp is zero.
In nanotechnology this concept can be applied to electron behavior. An electron when as single particle is a Fermion obeying the Pauli exclusion principle.
