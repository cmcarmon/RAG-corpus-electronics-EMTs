Accordingly, as depicted in Figure 8.20 we compute it by applying a small test
voltage vtest at the input and measuring the corresponding current itest. All other
independent small-signal voltages or DC voltage sources are shorted. Similarly,
all other independent small-signal or DC current sources are turned into open
circuits.
