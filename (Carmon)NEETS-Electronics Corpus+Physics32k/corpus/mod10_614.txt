Sky-wave transmission is used at high frequencies. Either horizontal or vertical polarization can be 
used with sky-wave transmission because the sky wave arrives at the receiving antenna elliptically 
polarized. This is the result of the wave traveling obliquely through the Earth's magnetic field and striking 
the ionosphere. The radio wave is given a twisting motion as it strikes the ionosphere. Its orientation 
continues to change because of the unstable nature of the ionosphere. The relative amplitudes and phase 
differences between the horizontal and vertical components of the received wave also change. Therefore, 
the transmitting and receiving antennas can be mounted either horizontally or vertically.
