Another version of the monostable multivibrator is shown in figure 3-15. View (A) is the circuit and 
view (B) shows the associated waveforms. In its stable condition (T0), Q1 is cut off and Q2 is conducting. 
The input trigger (positive pulse at T1) is applied to the collector of Q1 and coupled by C1 to the base of 
Q2 causing Q2 to be cut off. The collector voltage of Q2 then goes âˆ’VCC. The more negative voltage at 
the collector of Q2 forward biases Q1 through R4. With the forward bias, Q1 conducts, and the collector 
voltage of Q1 goes to about 0 volts. C1 now discharges and keeps Q2 cut off. Q2 remains cut off until C1 
discharges enough to allow Q2 to conduct again (T2). When Q2 conducts again, its collector voltage goes 
toward 0 volts and Q1 is cut off. The circuit returns to its quiescent state and has completed a cycle. The 
circuit remains in this stable state until the next trigger arrives (T3).
