The three-phase power can be measured by three single-phase wattmeters having current coils
in each line and potential coils connected across the given line and any common junction. Since
this common junction is completely arbitrary, it may be placed on any one of the three lines, in
which case the wattmeter connected in that line will indicate zero power because its potential coil
has no voltage across it. Hence, that wattmeter may be dispensed with, and three-phase power can
be measured by means of only two single-phase wattmeters having a common potential junction
on any of the three lines in which there is no current coil. This is known as the two-wattmeter
method of measuring three-phase power. In general, m-phase power can be measured by means
of m âˆ’ 1 wattmeters. The method is valid for both balanced and unbalanced circuits with either
the load or the source unbalanced.
