Thus,  on  an  intrinsic  level,  the  gate  response  time  is  closely  related  to  the  transit  time  of  an  electron  from
source to drain, which is L/usat in velocity saturation. At shorter L, a linear reduction in delay with L is predicted,
while  for  longer  devices  the  improvement  can  be  quadratic  in L,  depending  upon  how  VG  is  scaled  as  L  is
reduced.
