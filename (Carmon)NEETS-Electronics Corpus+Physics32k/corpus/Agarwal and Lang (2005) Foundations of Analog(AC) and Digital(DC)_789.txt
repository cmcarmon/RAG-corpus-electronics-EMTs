Implement the four-input ‘‘odd’’ or ‘‘odd parity’’ circuit depicted
in Figure 5.39 using NOR gates. In this circuit, the output Z is high if an odd number of
the inputs are high, otherwise the output Z is low. How would you use the four-input
‘‘odd’’ circuit module shown in Figure 5.39 to implement a three-input ‘‘odd’’ circuit?
If this cannot be done, discuss why not.

Figure 5.40 depicts a four-input majority circuit module. The
output Z of this circuit module is high if a majority of the inputs are high. Write a
boolean expression for Z in terms of A0, A1, A2, and A3. How would you use the
four-input majority circuit module shown in Figure 5.40 to implement a three-input
majority circuit and a two-input majority circuit? If either of these cannot be done,
discuss why not.

Figure 5.41 illustrates a two-bit grey code converter. Its outputs
OUT0, and OUT1, are equal to the inputs when the IN0, IN1 are 00 or 01. However,
when the inputs IN0, IN1 are 10 and 11, the outputs OUT0 and OUT1 are 11 and 10,
respectively. Implement the grey code converter using two-input NAND gates.

Figure 5.42 illustrates input-output voltage transfer functions
for several one-input one-output devices. For the voltage thresholds VOL, VIL, VOH,
and VIH as shown, which of the devices can serve as valid inverters?
