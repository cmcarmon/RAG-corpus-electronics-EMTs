During the first half cycle, the load circuit flux (dashed-line arrows) cancels in the center leg of the
core. This is shown in figure 3-36, view (A). As a result, there is no effect upon the flux from the control
circuit. During the second half cycle, the polarity of the a.c. (and therefore the polarity of the flux)
reverses as shown in view (B). The result is the same as it was during the first half cycle. There is no
effect upon the control circuit flux.
