Thus the virial theorem applies even without taking a time-average:
the kinetic energy of the system is equal to the absolute value of the total energy
the potential energy of the system is equal to twice the total energy
The escape velocity from any distance is √2 times the speed in a circular orbit at that distance: the kinetic energy is twice as much, hence the total energy is zero.
