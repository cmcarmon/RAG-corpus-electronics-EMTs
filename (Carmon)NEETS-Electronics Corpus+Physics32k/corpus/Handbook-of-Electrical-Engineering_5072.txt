Gas Chromatograph
Molecules in gases have thermal conductivities which are dependent on their masses; therefore, a pure gas can
be identiﬁed by its thermal conductivity. One way to determine the composition of a gas is to ﬁrst separate it
into  its  components  and  then  measure  the  thermal  conductivity  of  each. A  gas  chromatograph  does  exactly
that.  The  gas  ﬂows  through  a  long  narrow  column,  which  is  packed  with  an  adsorbant  solid  (for  gas–solid
chromatography) wherein the gases are separated according to the retentive properties of the packing material
for each gas. As the individual gases exit the end of the tube one at a time, they ﬂow over a heated wire. The
amount of heat transferred to the gas depends on its thermal conductivity. The gas temperature is measured
a short distance downstream and compared to a known gas ﬂowing in a separate sensing tube. The temperature
is related to the amount of heat transferred and can be used to derive the thermal conductivity according to
thermodynamic  theory  and  empirical  data.  This  sensor  required  two  transductions:  a  chemical  to  thermal
energy transduction followed by a thermal to electrical transduction.
