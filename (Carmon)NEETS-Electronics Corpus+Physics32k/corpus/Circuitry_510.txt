Programmed logic devices 
 
Whilst not an example of a microprocessor device, 
a
a 
programmable  chip  that  can  carry  out  complex 
logical  operations.  For  completeness,  we  have 
included a reference to such devices here. PLDs are 
capable  of 
large  number  of 
conventional  logic  gates,  thus  minimising  chip-
count  and  reducing  printed  circuit  board  sizes. 
Programming 
is  relatively  straightforward  and 
simply  requires  the  derivation  of  complex  logic 
functions  using  Boolean  algebra  (see  Chapter  10) 
or truth tables. Typical examples are the 16L8 and 
22V10.
