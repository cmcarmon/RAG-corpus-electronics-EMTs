In Section I, focus is on analysis only (leaving coverage of synthesis and design to Section III, “Electronics”).
Speciﬁcally, the passive circuit elements—resistors, capacitors, inductors, transformers, and fuses—as well as
voltage and current sources (active elements) are discussed. This is followed by a brief discussion on the elements
of linear circuit analysis. Next, some popularly used passive ﬁlters and nonlinear circuits are introduced. Then,
p
  conﬁgurations  are  covered.  Finally,  transfer
Laplace  transform,  state  variables, 
functions, frequency response, and stability analysis are discussed.
