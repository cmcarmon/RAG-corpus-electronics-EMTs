In this section, a computer methodology is presented for the
solution of the QP clock scheduling problem introduced in
Section 4.3. Different computer implementations are analyzed
and compared in detail in Subsection 4.5.1. It is shown that the
QP problem can be efﬁciently solved, and three computer
algorithmic procedures for this solution are discussed. These
three algorithms are demonstrated to have O(r 3) run time
complexity and O(r 2) storage complexity, where r is the
number of registers in the circuit. The numerical constants of
the leading terms in these complexity expressions are derived
as a function of the ratio of the number of local data paths to
the number of registers in the circuit, thereby permitting a
suitable algorithm to be chosen for a speciﬁc circuit. Further-
more, the methodology presented in Section 4.3 is extended
here to account for two important details of practical interest.
The circuit graph model is revisited in Section 4.5.3, where it is
shown that certain clock skews from the basis are uncon-
strained18, and this information is integrated into the math-
ematical framework described in Section 4.3. Section 4.5.4,
