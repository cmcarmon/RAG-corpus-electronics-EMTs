Clearly, the more constrained the rules of language in the
recognizer, the less freedom of expression the user has in
constructing spoken messages. The challenge of LM’ing is to
balance the need for maximally constraining the ‘‘pathways’’
that messages may take in the recognizer while minimizing the
degree to which freedom of expression is diminished. A meas-
ure of the extent to which an LM constrains permissible
discourse is given by the perplexity. This term roughly
means the average number of branches at any decision point
when the decoding of messages is viewed as the search through
a graph of permissible utterances.
