system of rate R will encode a block of n outputs Xn as an index f(Xn) ˛ {1, 2, . . ., º2n Rß}. (Thus, the index will
require R bits/input symbol.) The decoder will calculate a representation ˆX n(f (Xn )) of Xn. Normally, the repre-
sentation alphabet ˆX of the representation is the same as the source alphabet X, but that need not be the case.
