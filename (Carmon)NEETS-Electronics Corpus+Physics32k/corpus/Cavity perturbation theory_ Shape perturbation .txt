When a general shape of a resonant cavity is changed, a corresponding change in resonant frequency can be approximated as:

Expression (3) for change in resonant frequency can additionally be written in terms of time-average stored energies as:

where



Δ

W

m




{\displaystyle \Delta W_{m}}
and



Δ

W

e




{\displaystyle \Delta W_{e}}
represent time-average electric and magnetic energies contained in

V


{\displaystyle \Delta V}
.
This expression can also be written in terms of energy densities  as:
