For a practical receiver, the noise power is often greater than
the thermal noise power. The total noise power at the receiver
output may be considered to be equal to the thermal noise
power multiplied by a factor called the noise ﬁgure. The noise
ﬁgure is a measure of the degradation of signal-to-noise-ratio
as the signal passes through the receiver. It measures how
much noise is added by the receiver and can be expressed by:
