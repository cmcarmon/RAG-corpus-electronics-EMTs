Calculating the risetime budget involves calculating the risetimes of the link transmitter and the
optical fiber. The composite optical transmitter/fiber risetime is referred to as the fiber exit risetime. If
the fiber exit risetime is less than the maximum input risetime specified for the link receiver, then the link
design is viable.
