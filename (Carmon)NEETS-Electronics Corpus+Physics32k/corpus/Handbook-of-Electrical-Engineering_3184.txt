2. The forward converter (Fig. 30.22) is based on the buck converter. It is usually operated in the CCM to
reduce  the  peak  currents  and  does  not  have  the  stability  problem  of  the  ﬂyback  converter.  The  HF
transformer transfers energy directly to the output with very small stored energy. The output capacitor
size and peak current rating are smaller than they are for the ﬂyback. Reset winding is required to remove
the stored energy in the transformer. Maximum duty cycle is about 0.45 and limits the control range.
This topology is used for power levels up to about 1 kW.
