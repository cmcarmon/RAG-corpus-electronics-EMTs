Epoxy resins are prepared from an epoxide monomer. The ﬁrst step involves a reaction between two comono-
mers, and in the subsequent step the prepolymer is cured by means of a cross-linking agent. Epoxy resins are
characterized by low shrinkage and high mechanical strength; they may be reinforced with glass ﬁbers and mixed
with mica ﬂakes. Epoxy resins have many applications such as, for example, for insulation of bars in the stators
of rotating machines, solid-type transformers, and spacers for compressed-gas-insulated busbars and cables.
