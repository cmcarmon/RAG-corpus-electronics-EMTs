ISA extensions have been deﬁned for the major microprocessor architectures. The MAX extension for the
HP PA-RISC architecture [Lee96] was the ﬁrst ISA extension and introduced the notion of subword parallelism.
The VIS (Visual Instruction Set) extension [Tre96] has been added to the Sun SPARC architecture. The Intel
x86 architecture has been extended with the MMX instructions [Pel96].
