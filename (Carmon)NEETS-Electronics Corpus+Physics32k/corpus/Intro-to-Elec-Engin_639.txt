A closer approximation to the actual diode voltâ€“ampere characteristic than that in Figure
7.2.5(a) is depicted in Figure 7.2.5(b), which includes the effect of the forward (dynamic)
resistance Rf, whose value is the reciprocal of the slope of the straight-line portion of the
approximate characteristic beyond the threshold voltage Von.
