Attachment process: A  process  that  occurs  when  one  or  more  stepped  leader  branches  approach  within  a
hundred  meters  or  so  of  the  ground  and  the  electric  ﬁeld  at  the  ground  increases  above  the  critical
breakdown ﬁeld of the surrounding air. At that time one or more upward-going discharges is initiated.
After traveling a few tens of meters, one of the upward discharges, which is essentially at ground potential,
contracts the tip of one branch of the stepped leader, which is at a high potential, completing the leader
path to ground.
