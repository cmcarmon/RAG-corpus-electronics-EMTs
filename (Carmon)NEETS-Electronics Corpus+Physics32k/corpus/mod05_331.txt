CAPACITOR-START.â€”The first type of split-phase induction motor that will be covered is the
capacitor-start type. Figure 4-11 shows a simplified schematic of a typical capacitor-start motor. The
stator consists of the main winding and a starting winding (auxiliary). The starting winding is connected
in parallel with the main winding and is placed physically at right angles to it. A 90-degree electrical
