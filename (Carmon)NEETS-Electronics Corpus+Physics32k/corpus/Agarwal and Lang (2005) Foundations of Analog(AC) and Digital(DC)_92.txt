6. The voltage across the terminals of an element is defined as the work done in moving a unit
charge (one coulomb) from one terminal to the other through the element against the electrical
field. Voltages are measured in volts (V), where one volt is one joule per coulomb.
7. The current is defined as the rate of flow of charge from one terminal to the other through the
element. Current is measured in amperes (A) , where one ampere is one coulomb per second.
