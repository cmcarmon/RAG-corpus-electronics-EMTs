Vectorization
Vector  instructions  were  originally  invented  for  supercomputers  to  improve  the  performance  of  scientiﬁc
calculations. Although video operations are generally done in ﬁxed-point rather than ﬂoating-point arithmetic,
vector  instructions  are  well-suited  to  the  many  video  operations  that  can  be  expressed  in  linear  algebra.
Vectorization was used in many early video processors. More recently, SIMD has become more popular, but
with vectorization becoming more popular in general-purpose microprocessors, there may be a resurgence of
vector units for multimedia computation.
