Fiber optic communication systems operate in the 850-nm, the 1300-nm, and the 1550-nm
wavelength windows. Semiconductor sources are designed to operate at wavelengths that minimize
optical fiber absorption and maximize system bandwidth. By designing an optical source to operate at
specific wavelengths, absorption from impurities in the optical fiber, such as hydroxyl ions (OH -), can be
minimized. Maximizing system bandwidth involves designing optical fibers and sources that minimize
chromatic and intermodal dispersion at the intended operational wavelength.
