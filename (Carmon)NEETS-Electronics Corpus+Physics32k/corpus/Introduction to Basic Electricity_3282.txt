The schematic symbol for a P-channel enhance-
ment MOSFET is shown in Figure 32-13. It is the same 
as that for a P-channel depletion MOSFET except that 
a broken line is used to interconnect the source, drain, 
and substrate region. This indicates the normally off 
condition. The arrow points outward to indicate a  
P channel.
