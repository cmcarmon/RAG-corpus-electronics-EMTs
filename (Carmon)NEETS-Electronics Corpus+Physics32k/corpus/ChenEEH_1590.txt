In a backward-chaining reasoning system the goal is ini-
tially placed in the working memory. The system matches rule
conclusions with the goal, selects one rule, and places its
premises in the working memory. The process iterates, with
these premises becoming new goals to match against rule
conclusions. Thus, the system works backward from the ori-
ginal goal until all the subgoals in the working memory are
known to be true. Subgoals may also be solved by asking the
user for information. For example, MYCIN’s inference engine
uses a backward-chaining control strategy. From its goal of
ﬁnding signiﬁcant disease-causing organisms, MYCIN uses its
rules to reason backward to the data available. Once it ﬁnds
such organisms, it attempts to select a therapy to treat the
disease(s). Since it was designed as a consultant for physicians,
MYCIN was given the ability to explain both its reasoning and
its knowledge (Buchanan and Shortliffe, 1984).
