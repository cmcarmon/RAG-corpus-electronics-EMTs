View (D) shows another audio amplifier. This time the frequency limits are 30 hertz (f1) and 200
hertz (f2). The bandwidth of this amplifier is only 170 hertz. The important thing to notice in view (D) is
that the frequency scale is different from those used in other views. Any frequency scale can be used for a
frequency-response curve. The scale used would be determined by what frequencies are most useful in
presenting the frequency-response curve for a particular amplifier.
