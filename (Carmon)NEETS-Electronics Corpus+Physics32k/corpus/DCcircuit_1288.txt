only 2 µF. However, its working voltage is quite high: 2000 volts! If this capacitor were re-
engineered to have a thinner layer of dielectric between its plates, at least a hundredfold in-
crease in capacitance might be achievable, but at a cost of signiﬁcantly lowering its working
voltage. Compare the above photograph with the one below. The capacitor shown in the lower
picture is an electrolytic unit, similar in size to the one above, but with very different values of
capacitance and working voltage:
