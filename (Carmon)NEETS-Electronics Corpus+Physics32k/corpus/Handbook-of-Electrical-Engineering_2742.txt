B. Veriﬁcation  of  Function’s  Behavior:  It  is  important  to  verify  that  the  behavior  speciﬁcation  of  today’s
complex  ICs  properly  represents  the  behavior  desired.  In  the  case  of  HDL  languages,  there  may  be
software “debugging”  of  the “program”  until  the  desired  behavior  is  obtained,  much  as  programming
languages need to be debugged until correct operation is obtained. Early veriﬁcation is important since
any errors in the speciﬁcation of the function will lead to an IC which is faulty as a result of the design,
rather than of physical defects.
