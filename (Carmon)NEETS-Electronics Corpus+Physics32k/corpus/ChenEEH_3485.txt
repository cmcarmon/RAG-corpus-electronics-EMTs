of these devices is often not much larger than 60 Hz (in 60-Hz
systems). Harmonics may be attenuated by the current or
potential transformer, and this adds intolerable error to the
measurement. Relaying grade current and relaying potential
transformers are usually not much better because of limited
bandwidth. Revenue meter grade current and voltage trans-
formers are generally not designed for high bandwidth appli-
cations. Laboratory grade transformers are usually the best
choice. Modern power quality instruments generally have
companion current and voltage transformers for use with a
given instrument, and the manual for the instrument will
contain the bandwidth measurement of the transformers. It
is noted that for many voltage and current instruments used in
power quality tests, current and voltage transformers are the
most costly components of the instrumentation system.
