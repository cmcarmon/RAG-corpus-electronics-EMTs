The relative speed of separation vseparation of an object A after a collision with another object B is related to the relative speed of approach vapproach by the coefficient of restitution, defined by Newton's experimental impact law:




e
=




|


v



|


separation





|


v



|


approach









{\displaystyle e={\frac {|\mathbf {v} |_{\text{separation}}}{|\mathbf {v} |_{\text{approach}}}}\,\!}

which depends the materials A and B are made from, since the collision involves interactions at the surfaces of A and B. Usually 0 ≤ e ≤ 1, in which e = 1 for completely elastic collisions, and e = 0 for completely inelastic collisions. It's possible for e ≥ 1 to occur – for superelastic (or explosive) collisions.
