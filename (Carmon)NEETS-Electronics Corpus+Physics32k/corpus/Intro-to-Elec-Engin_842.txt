Under most normal operating conditions, the various components of the three-phase system
are characterized by complete phase symmetry. If such phase symmetry is assured throughout
the power system, it is desirable to simplify the analytical efforts to a great extent by the use of
per-phase analysis. Also recall that three-phase systems are most often represented by single-line
(one-line) diagrams.
