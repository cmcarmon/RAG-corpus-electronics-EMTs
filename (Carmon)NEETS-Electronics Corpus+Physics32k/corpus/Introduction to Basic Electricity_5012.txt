Using two 45° angles instead of one 90° angle, 
or using a curve, will save space. This is especially 
true when there are a lot of traces running  parallel 
to each other. The more space saved, the smaller 
and less expensive the printed circuit board will be. 
Printed circuit boards are purchased by the square 
inch.
