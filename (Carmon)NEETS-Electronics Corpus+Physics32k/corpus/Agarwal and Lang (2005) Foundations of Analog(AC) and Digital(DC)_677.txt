a) Assuming the diode can be modeled as an ideal diode, and R1 = R2, plot the
waveform vo(t) for the circuit in Figure 4.57, assuming a triangle wave input. Write
an expression for vo(t) in terms of vi, R1, and R2.
If the triangle wave has a peak amplitude of only 2 volts, and R1 = R2, a more
accurate diode model must be used. Plot and write an expression for vo assuming
that the diode is modeled using an ideal diode in series with a 0.6-volt source. Draw
the transfer curve vo versus vi.
