Tether locks are probably the second most common type of lock seen on the mountain and protecting equipment. These are typically more rugged and heavy weight than the cable locks which increases the protection they can provide at the expense of convenience. The user is still generally required to carry the lock around with them during the day.
Tether locks are can only be securely fastened if the equipment has some sort of closed loop (for example on the bindings of snowboards). The tether at one end must wrap around the equipment and the lock at the other must then thread through the tether. The lock can then be used to clip on to any fixed object. They are usually fastened with a code or with a key once again requiring that the user remove their gloves to operate.
