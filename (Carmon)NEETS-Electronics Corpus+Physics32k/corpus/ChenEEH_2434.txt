This section presents a number of basic antenna elements,
starting with a small dipole antenna that is considered the most
fundamental radiating structure. Behaviors only in the far-ﬁeld
region are emphasized, and various radiation and impedance
parameters of the speciﬁc antennas are derived from them. For
general deﬁnitions and notations used in this study, the reader is
referred to Das (2004). Some useful parameters of the antenna
elements covered in this section are summarized in Table 6.1.
