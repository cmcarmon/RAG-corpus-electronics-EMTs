Angular momentum is a vector quantity (more precisely, a pseudovector) that represents the product of a body's rotational inertia and rotational velocity about a particular axis. However, if the particle's trajectory lies in a single plane, it is sufficient to discard the vector nature of angular momentum, and treat it as a scalar (more precisely, a pseudoscalar). Angular momentum can be considered a rotational analog of linear momentum. Thus, where linear momentum



p


{\displaystyle p}
is proportional to mass



m


{\displaystyle m}
and linear speed



v


{\displaystyle v}
,




p
=
m
v
,


{\displaystyle p=mv,}

angular momentum



L


{\displaystyle L}
is proportional to moment of inertia



I


{\displaystyle I}
and angular speed



ω


{\displaystyle \omega }
,




L
=
I
ω
.


{\displaystyle L=I\omega .}

Unlike mass, which depends only on amount of matter, moment of inertia is also dependent on the position of the axis of rotation and the shape of the matter. Unlike linear speed, which occurs in a straight line, angular speed occurs about a center of rotation. Therefore, strictly speaking,



L


{\displaystyle L}
should be referred to as the angular momentum relative to that center.
Because



I
=

r

2


m


{\displaystyle I=r^{2}m}
for a single particle and



ω
=


v
r




{\displaystyle \omega ={\frac {v}{r}}}
for circular motion, angular momentum can be expanded,



L
=

r

2


m
⋅


v
r


,


{\displaystyle L=r^{2}m\cdot {\frac {v}{r}},}
and reduced to,




L
=
r
m
v
,


{\displaystyle L=rmv,}

the product of the radius of rotation



r


{\displaystyle r}
and the linear momentum of the particle



p
=
m
v


{\displaystyle p=mv}
, where



v


{\displaystyle v}
in this case is the equivalent linear (tangential) speed at the radius (



=
r
ω


{\displaystyle =r\omega }
).
This simple analysis can also apply to non-circular motion if only the component of the motion which is perpendicular to the radius vector is considered. In that case,




L
=
r
m

v

⊥


,


{\displaystyle L=rmv_{\perp },}

where




v

⊥


=
v
sin
⁡
(
θ
)


{\displaystyle v_{\perp }=v\sin(\theta )}
is the perpendicular component of the motion. Expanding,



L
=
r
m
v
sin
⁡
(
θ
)
,


{\displaystyle L=rmv\sin(\theta ),}
rearranging,



L
=
r
sin
⁡
(
θ
)
m
v
,


{\displaystyle L=r\sin(\theta )mv,}
and reducing, angular momentum can also be expressed,




L
=

r

⊥


m
v
,


{\displaystyle L=r_{\perp }mv,}

where




r

⊥


=
r
sin
⁡
(
θ
)


{\displaystyle r_{\perp }=r\sin(\theta )}
is the length of the moment arm, a line dropped perpendicularly from the origin onto the path of the particle. It is this definition, (length of moment arm)×(linear momentum) to which the term moment of momentum refers.
