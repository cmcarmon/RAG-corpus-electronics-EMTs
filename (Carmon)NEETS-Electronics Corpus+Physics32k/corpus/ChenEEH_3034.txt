The three-phase ac systems have been adopted worldwide.
The frequency of the ac and the voltage levels chosen around
the world vary. The frequency of 60 Hz was adopted in North
America (and a few other places), and 50 Hz is used in all other
parts of the world. Because the frequency must be the same to
interconnect power systems, only these two frequencies have
become standards (exceptions to this are a few isolated systems
like those used in rail transportation).
