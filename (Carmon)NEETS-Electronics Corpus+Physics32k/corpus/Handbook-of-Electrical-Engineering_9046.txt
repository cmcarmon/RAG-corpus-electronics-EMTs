Very low-cost, compact, low-power printers have been developed based on this technology because energy
requirements  are  very  low  and  the  printhead  can  be  made  inexpensively  using  semiconductor-like  planar
processing techniques. A proliferation of these printer products (many with color) have appeared in the market
over the past Ô¨Åve years.
