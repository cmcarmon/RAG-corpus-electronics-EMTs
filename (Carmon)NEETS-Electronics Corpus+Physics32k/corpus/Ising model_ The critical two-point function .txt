To determine the form of G, consider that the fields in a path integral obey the classical equations of motion derived by varying the free energy:

→

=
0






{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}&&\left(-\nabla _{x}^{2}+t\right)\langle H(x)H(y)\rangle &=0\\\rightarrow {}&&\nabla ^{2}G(x)+tG(x)&=0\end{aligned}}}

This is valid at noncoincident points only, since the correlations of H are singular when points collide. H obeys classical equations of motion for the same reason that quantum mechanical operators obey them—its fluctuations are defined by a path integral.
At the critical point t = 0, this is Laplace's equation, which can be solved by Gauss's method from electrostatics. Define an electric field analog by




E
=
∇
G


{\displaystyle E=\nabla G}

Away from the origin:




∇
⋅
E
=
0


{\displaystyle \nabla \cdot E=0}

since G is spherically symmetric in d dimensions, and E is the radial gradient of G. Integrating over a large d − 1 dimensional sphere,

{\displaystyle \int d^{d-1}SE_{r}=\mathrm {constant} }

This gives:

{\displaystyle E={C \over r^{d-1}}}

and G can be found by integrating with respect to r.

The constant C fixes the overall normalization of the field.
