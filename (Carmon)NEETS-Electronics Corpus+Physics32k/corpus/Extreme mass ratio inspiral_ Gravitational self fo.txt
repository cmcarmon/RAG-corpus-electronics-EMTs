The large value of the mass ratio in an EMRI opens another avenue for approximation: expansion in one over the mass ratio. To zeroth order, the path of the lighter object will be a geodesic in the Kerr spacetime generated by the supermassive black hole. Corrections due to the finite mass of the lighter object can then be included, order-by-order in the mass ratio, as an effective force on the object. This effective force is known as the gravitational self force.
In the last decade or so, a lot of progress has been made in calculating the gravitational self force for EMRIs. Numerical codes are available to calculate the gravitational self force on any bound orbit around a non-rotating (Schwarzschild) black hole. And significant progress has been made for calculating the gravitational self force around a rotating black hole.
