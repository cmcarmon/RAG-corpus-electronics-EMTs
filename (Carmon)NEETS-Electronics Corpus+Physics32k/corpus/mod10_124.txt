In empty rooms or other confined spaces, sound may be reflected several times to cause what is
known as reverberation. REVERBERATION is the multiple reflections of sound waves. Reverberations
seem to prolong the time during which a sound is heard. Examples of this often occur in nature. For
instance, the discharge of lightning causes a sharp, quick sound. By the time this sound has reached the
ears of a distant observer, it is usually drawn out into a prolonged roar by reverberations that we call
thunder. A similar case often arises with underwater sound equipment. Reverberations from nearby points
may continue for such a long time that they interfere with the returning echoes from targets.
