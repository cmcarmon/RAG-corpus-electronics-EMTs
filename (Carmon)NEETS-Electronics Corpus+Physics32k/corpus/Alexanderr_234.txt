It  can  also  be  used  in  making  a  voltage-  or  current-controlled  current
source. An  op  amp  can  sum  signals,  amplify  a  signal,  integrate  it,  or
differentiate it. The ability of the op amp to perform these mathemat-
ical  operations  is  the  reason  it  is  called  an  operational  ampliÔ¨Åer. It  is
also  the  reason  for  the  widespread  use  of  op  amps  in  analog  design.
Op amps are popular in practical circuit designs because they are ver-
satile, inexpensive, easy to use, and fun to work with.
