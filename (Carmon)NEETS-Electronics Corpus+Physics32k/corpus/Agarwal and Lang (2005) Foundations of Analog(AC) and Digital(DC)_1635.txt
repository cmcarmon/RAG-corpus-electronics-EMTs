3. NMOS logic families actually use a special kind of pullup called a depletion-mode MOSFET,
which has a negative threshold voltage. The MOSFETs that we have been dealing with thus far
are called enhancement-mode MOSFETs. The depletion-mode MOSFET is used as a pullup with
its gate connected to its source instead of the power supply. One of its advantages is that it does
not require a second supply voltage.
4. Although the static power for CMOS is significantly lower than NMOS, sources of static power
loss still remain, such as leakage currents.
5. We saw the p-channel MOSFET briefly in the context of amplifiers in Chapter 7 in Example 7.7.
Here we will focus on its use in digital circuits.
