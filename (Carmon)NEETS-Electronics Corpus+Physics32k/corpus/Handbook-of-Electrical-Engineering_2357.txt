In  FDM,  the  region  under  simulation  is  divided  into  rectangular  or  triangular  areas  for  two-dimensional
cases or into cubic or tetrahedron volumes in three-dimensional cases. Each corner or vertex is considered as
a node. The differential equations are modiﬁed using ﬁnite difference approximations, and a set of equations
is  constructed  in  matrix  form.  The  ﬁnite  difference  equations  are  solved  iteratively  at  only  these  nodes.  The
most commonly used solvers are Gauss–Seidel/Jacobi (G-S/J) techniques or Newton’s technique (NT) [Banks
et al., 1983]. FDM has the disadvantage of requiring more nodes than the FEM for the same structure. A new
variation  of  FDM,  namely  the  ﬁnite  boxes  scheme  [Franz  et al.,  1983],  however,  overcomes  this  problem  by
enabling local area reﬁnement. The advantage of FDM is that its computational memory requirement is less
than that required for FEM because of the band structure of the matrix.
