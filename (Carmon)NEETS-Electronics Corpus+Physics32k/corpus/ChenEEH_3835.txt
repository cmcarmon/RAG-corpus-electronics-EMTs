represents uniformly distributed white noise between 0 and
255. To know something about a given pixel does not imply
knowing anything about the pixels around it. Such an image,
however, is not useful for carrying information and is not of
the kind frequently present in nature. Indeed, one can state
that most natural images are redundant. Therefore, they are
amenable to compression. How to exploit this redundancy to
create a compact representation of an image is the main
objective of image compression techniques.
