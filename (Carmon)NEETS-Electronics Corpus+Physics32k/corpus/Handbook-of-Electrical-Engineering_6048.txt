Power  systems  are  designed  to  survive  all  probable  contingencies. A  contingency  is  deﬁned  as  an  event  that
causes  one  or  more  important  components  such  as  transmission  lines,  generators,  and  transformers  to  be
unexpectedly removed from service. Survival means the system stabilizes and continues to operate at acceptable
voltage and frequency levels without loss of load. Operations must deal with a vast number of possible conditions
experienced by the system, many of which are not anticipated in planning. Instead of dealing with the impossible
task  of  analyzing  all  possible  system  states,  security  control  starts  with  a  speciﬁc  state:  the  current  state  if
executing  the  real-time  network  sequence;  a  postulated  state  if  executing  a  study  sequence.  Sequence  means
sequential execution of programs that perform the following steps:
