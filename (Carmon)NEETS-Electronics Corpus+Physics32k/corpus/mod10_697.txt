The pattern shown in figure 4-24, view B, has radiation concentrated in two lobes. The radiation 
intensity in one lobe is considerably stronger than in the other. The lobe toward point X is called a 
MAJOR LOBE; the other is a MINOR LOBE. Since the complex radiation patterns associated with 
arrays frequently contain several lobes of varying intensity, you should learn to use appropriate 
terminology. In general, major lobes are those in which the greatest amount of radiation occurs. Minor 
lobes are those in which the radiation intensity is least.
