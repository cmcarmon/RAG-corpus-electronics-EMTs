Cascade ﬁlter designs require the transfer function to be expressed as a product of ﬁrst- and second-order
terms. For each of these terms a practical circuit can be implemented. Examples of these circuits are presented
in Figs. 29.12–29.22. In general the following ﬁrst- and second-order terms can be distinguished:
