Duhamel's principle is the result that the solution to an inhomogeneous, linear, partial differential equation can be solved by first finding the solution for a step input, and then superposing using Duhamel's integral. Suppose we have a constant coefficient, mth order inhomogeneous ordinary differential equation.

We can reduce this to the solution of a homogeneous ODE using the following method. All steps are done formally, ignoring necessary requirements for the solution to be well defined.
First let G solve

{\displaystyle P(\partial _{t})G=0,\;\partial _{t}^{j}G(0)=0,\quad 0\leq j\leq m-2,\;\partial _{t}^{m-1}G(0)=1/a_{m}.}
