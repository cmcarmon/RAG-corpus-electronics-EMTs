 
The  concept  of  complex  impedance  introduces  a  unified  representation  for 
resistors, capacitors, and inductors, whereby a circuitâ€™s frequency response from input to 
output  can  be  determined  using  KVL  and  KCL,  where  each  element  is  assigned  the 
appropriate impedance. The key assumption to this point is that the input to the circuit 
must consist solely of DC and/or sinusoidal signals. Now, this analysis is be extended to 
include  arbitrary  input  signals  by  using  the  mathematical  techniques  of  Laplace 
transforms.
