3. Cumulative propagation errors: Additional computa-
tional burdens may arise due to the need for either
progressive mesh reﬁnement or progressively higher
accuracy algorithms to bound cumulative positional
or phase errors for propagating numerical modes in
progressively enlarged meshes. Any need for progres-
sive mesh reﬁnement would feed back to factor 1.
