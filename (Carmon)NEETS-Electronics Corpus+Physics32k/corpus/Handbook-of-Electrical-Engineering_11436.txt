For  users  of  single  detector  systems,  developments  in  the  pulse  processing  electronics  necessary  for  data
acquisition and in the hardware and software for data analysis have resulted in both more compact and more
ﬂexible systems. Plug-in cards for a personal computer are available now that not only contain the functions
of the ADC and multichannel analyzer, but also the high voltage power supply and ampliﬁer as well. Software
developments also allow for control of many pulse processing parameters that were previously set manually.
