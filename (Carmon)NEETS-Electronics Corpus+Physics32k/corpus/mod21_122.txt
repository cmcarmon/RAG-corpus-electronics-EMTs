It is imperative that you be able to troubleshoot an equipment failure to the component level. In the
majority of cases, Navy technicians are expected to troubleshoot and identify faulty components. This
chapter, "Component Testing," will acquaint you with alternative methods of testing various components
and their parameters. A quick glance at the Navyâ€™s mission and concept of operation explains why we, in
most cases, must be able to troubleshoot to the faulty component level. A ship must be a self-sustaining
unit when deployed. Storage space is a primary consideration on most ships and a limiting factor for
storage of bulky items or electronic modules as ready spares. Therefore, it is practical to store only
individual components common to a great number of equipment types. This of course, limits the larger
replacement modules available to you during troubleshooting.
