Figure 5-14 illustrates the OTDR measurement points for measuring the attenuation of the test fiber
using a dead-zone fiber. Fiber attenuation between two points along the test fiber is measured on gradual
downsloping sections on the OTDR trace. There should be no point defects present along the portion of
fiber being tested.
