Figure 7.38 presents a number of nonplanar band-pass
ﬁlters, including waveguide, dielectric, and coaxial line ﬁlters.
Various waveguide ﬁlters have been developed over the fre-
quency range from 1 GHz to more than 100 GHz. They are in
the form of cascaded rectangular or circular cavities in which
low-loss resonant modes are excited. Waveguide ﬁlters may be
