Type Constructors
Enumerated Types
Beginning with Pascal, modern languages provide a rather useful constructor for scalar types, called enumerated
types.  Enumerated  types  have  ﬁnite  (small)  carrier  sets  that  the  programmer  deﬁnes  by  enumerating  the
constants of the type (speciﬁed as identiﬁers). For example, if the type Boolean were not available in Pascal,
its carrier set could simply be deﬁned by:
