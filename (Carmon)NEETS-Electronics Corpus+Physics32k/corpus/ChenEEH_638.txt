Savings percentage S
ave is demonstrated in Figure 1.6(B) for
various values of n and b. Savings are found to exceed 50% in
some cases. Notice that Figure 1.6 reveals that, for a particular
word length n, the proper selection of logarithm base b can
signiÔ¨Åcantly affect the average activity. Therefore, the choice of
b is important in designing a low-power LNS-based system.
