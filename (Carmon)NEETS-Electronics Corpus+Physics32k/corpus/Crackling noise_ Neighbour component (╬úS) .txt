The neighbour component for physical objects such as rocks or tectonic plates is simply a description of Newtonâ€™s laws of motion, if a plate is moving and collides with another plate, the other plate will provide a reactionary force, similarly if a large collection of loose particles (boulders, faults) is forced against its neighbour, the adjacent particle/object will also move.
