In a mobile cellular radio system (see Section 15.2) for the transmission of speech signals,
since the available channel bandwidth per user is small and cannot support the high bit rates
needed by waveform encoding methods such as PCM, the analysis–synthesis method based on
linear predictive coding (LPC) is used to estimate the set of model parameters from short segments
of the speech signal. The speech-model parameters are then transmitted over the channel. With
LPC, a bit rate of 4800–9600 bit/s is achieved.
