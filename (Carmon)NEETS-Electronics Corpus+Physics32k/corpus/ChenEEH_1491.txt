The lowest levels include the hardware and Ô¨Årmware of the
system. Level 1 is the electronic circuitry in which objects are
such things as registers, gates, and memory cells, and oper-
ations are clearing registers, reading memory cells, and other

somewhat more abstract entities, such as evaluation stacks and
arrays of memory locations. Level 3 adds the procedure and the
