a. SHORTSâ€”Any terminal or connection that is close to the chassis or to any other terminal 
should be examined for the possibility of a short. A short in any part of the power supply can 
cause considerable damage. Look for and remove any stray drops of solder, bits of wire, 
nuts, or screws. It sometimes helps to shake the chassis and listen for any tell-tale rattles. 
Remember to correct any problem that may cause a short circuit; if it is not causing trouble 
now, it may cause problems in the future.
