A semiconductor doped with donors is called an n-type
semiconductor. A semiconductor doped with acceptors is
called a p-type semiconductor. Often, especially at room tem-
perature or elevated temperatures, each donor in an n-type
semiconductor supplies one electron to the conduction band,
and the electron concentration, n, in the conduction band is
approximately equal to the donor concentration, Nd. In a
similar way, at room temperature or elevated temperatures,
each acceptor creates one hole in the valence band, and the
hole concentration, p, in the valence band of a p-type semi-
conductor is approximately equal to the acceptor concentra-
tion, Na. If both donors and acceptors are added to a
semiconductor, they ‘‘compensate’’ each other, since electrons
