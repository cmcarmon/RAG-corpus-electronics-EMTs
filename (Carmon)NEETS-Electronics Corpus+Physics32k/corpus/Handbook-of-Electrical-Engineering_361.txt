Measuring AC Power and Energy
With ac steady-state average power given in the ﬁrst line of Eq. (3.6), measuring the average power requires
measuring  the  rms  values  of  voltage  and  current,  as  well  as  the  power  factor.  This  is  accomplished  by  the
arrangement  shown  in  Fig.  3.26,  which  includes  a  breakout  of  an  electrodynamometer-type  wattmeter.  The
current  in  the  high-resistance  pivoted  coil  is  proportional  to  the  voltage  across  the  load.  The  current  to  the
load and the pivoted coil together through the energizing coil of the electromagnet establishes a proportional
magnetic ﬁeld across the cylinder of rotation of the pivoted coil. the torque on the pivoted coil is proportional
to the product of the magnetic ﬁeld strength and the current in the pivoted coil. If the current in the pivoted
coil is negligible compared to that in the load, then the torque becomes essentially proportional to the product
of  the  voltage  across  the  load  (equal  to  that  across  the  pivoted  coil)  and  the  current  in  the  load  (essentially
equal to that through the energizing coil of the electromagnet). The dynamics of the pivoted coil together with
the restraining spring, at ac power frequencies, ensures that the angular displacement of the pivoted coil becomes
proportional to the average of the torque or, equivalently, the average power.
