The Huffman code is determined from the binary tree shown in Fig. 17.8. This tree is constructed recursively
by combining the two least probable symbols in the alphabet into one composite symbol whose probability of
occurrence is the sum of the probabilities of the two symbols that it represents. The code words for these two
symbols  are  the  same  as  that  of  the  composite  symbol  with  a  0  or  a  1  appended  at  the  end  to  distinguish
between them. This procedure is repeated until the reduced alphabet contains only a single code word. Then
the code word for a particular source symbol is determined by traversing the tree from its root to the leaf node
for that source symbol.
