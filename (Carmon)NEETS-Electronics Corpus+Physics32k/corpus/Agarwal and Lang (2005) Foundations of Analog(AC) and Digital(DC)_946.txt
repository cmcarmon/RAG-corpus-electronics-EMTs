e x a m p l e 7.3 a m o s f e t c i r c u i t Determine the current iDS for
the circuit in Figure 7.17. For the MOSFET, assume that K = 1 mA / V2 and VT = 1 V.
It is easy to see that the MOSFET in Figure 7.17 is operating in its saturation region,
since the drain-to-source voltage (5 V) is greater than vGS − VT (2 V − 1 V = 1 V ).
Therefore, we can directly calculate the desired current using the MOSFET equation for
saturation region operation
