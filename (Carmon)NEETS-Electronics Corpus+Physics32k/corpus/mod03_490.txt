relatively independent of the activating mechanism movement. In other words, in a toggle switch, no
matter how fast or slow you move the toggle, the actual switching of the circuit takes place at a fixed
speed. The snap-acting switch is constructed by making the switch mechanism a leaf spring so that it
"snaps" between positions. A snap-acting switch will always be in one of the positions designed for that
switch. The switch cannot be "between" positions. A two-position, single-pole, double-throw, snap-acting
switch could not be left in an OFF position.
