have positive susceptibility. All atoms are diamagnetic by virtue of their having electrons. Some atoms are also
paramagnetic as well, but in this case they are called paramagnetics since paramagnetism is roughly a hundred
times stronger than diamagnetism and overwhelms it. Faraday discovered that paramagnetics are attracted by
a magnetic ﬁeld and move toward the region of maximum ﬁeld, whereas diamagnetics are repelled and move
toward a ﬁeld minimum.
