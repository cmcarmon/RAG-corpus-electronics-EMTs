A subtlety of source coding is whether we need “commas” in the bitstream. When we use an unequal number
of bits to represent symbols, how does the receiver determine when symbols begin and end? If you created a
source code that required a separation marker in the bitstream between symbols, it would be very ineﬃcient
since you are essentially requiring an extra symbol in the transmission stream.
