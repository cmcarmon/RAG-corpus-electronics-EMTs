Resonant circuits are useful in analog design to build filters with high selec-
tivity such as radio tuners and channel selectors in cell phones and wireless
networks. Resonant circuits are also used to build oscillators to produce sinu-
soids of a given frequency. The same oscillators also form the basis of clock
generators in digital design.
