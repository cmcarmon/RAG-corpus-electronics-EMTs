The Simpson gearset is now more or less obsolete. Other gearsets can make 4 forward gears with just two planetaries. Most modern gearboxes employ the Ravigneaux planetary gearset design, which produces 4 forward gears from a single set, or a Lepelletier gearset which provides 6 or more forward gears by adding another standard planetary to the Ravigneaux gearset.
Nevertheless, some new cars are still sold with automatic transmissions based on the Simpson gearset. Such transmissions are typically four-speed, designed in the late 1990s, they are electronically controlled versions of older projects, and are kept in production because they are cheap, reliable, well-known and good enough for the target application.
