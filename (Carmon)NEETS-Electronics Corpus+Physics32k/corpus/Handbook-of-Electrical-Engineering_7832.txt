Sampled Tracking
Since  dynamic  track  runout  is  usually  a  slow  and  gradual  process,  there  is  actually  no  need  for  continuous
tracking as done on grooved media. A pair of embedded marks, offset from the track center as in Fig. 80.23(b),
can  provide  the  necessary  information  for  correcting  the  relative  position  of  the  focused  spot.  The  reﬂected
intensity will indicate the positions of the two servo marks as two successive short pulses. If the beam happens
to be on track, the two pulses will have equal magnitudes and there will be no need for correction. If, on the
other hand, the beam is off-track, one of the pulses will be stronger than the other. Depending on which pulse
is  the  stronger,  the  system  will  recognize  the  direction  in  which  it  has  to  move  and  will  correct  the  error
accordingly. The servo marks must appear frequently enough along the track to ensure proper track following.
In a typical application, the track might be divided into groups of 18 bytes, 2 bytes dedicated as servo offset
areas and 16 bytes ﬁlled with other format information or left blank for user data.
