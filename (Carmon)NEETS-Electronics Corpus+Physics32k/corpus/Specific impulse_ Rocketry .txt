In rocketry, where the only reaction mass is the propellant, an equivalent way of calculating the specific impulse in seconds is also frequently used. In this sense, specific impulse is defined as the thrust integrated over time per unit weight-on-Earth of the propellant:





I


s
p



=



v

e



g

0




,


{\displaystyle I_{\rm {sp}}={\frac {v_{\text{e}}}{g_{0}}},}

where





I


s
p





{\displaystyle I_{\rm {sp}}}
is the specific impulse measured in seconds,





v

e




{\displaystyle v_{\text{e}}}
is the average exhaust speed along the axis of the engine (in ft/s or m/s),





g

0




{\displaystyle g_{0}}
is the standard gravity (in ft/s2 or m/s2).
In rockets, due to atmospheric effects, the specific impulse varies with altitude, reaching a maximum in a vacuum. This is because the exhaust velocity isn't simply a function of the chamber pressure, but is a function of the difference between the interior and exterior of the combustion chamber. It is therefore important to note whether the specific impulse refers to operation in a vacuum or at sea level. Values are usually indicated with or near the units of specific impulse (e.g. "sl", "vac").
