Emerging Trends
Object-Oriented Databases
Object-oriented database systems (OODBMSs) [Brown, 1991] are one of the latest trends in database technol-
ogy.  The  emergence  of  OODBMS  is  in  response  to  the  requirements  of  advanced  applications.  In  general,
traditional commercial and administrative applications can be effectively modeled using one of the three record-
based data models. These applications are characterized by simple data types. Furthermore, for such applica-
tions, access and relationships are based on data values. Advanced database applications such as those found
in  engineering  CAD/CAM  require  complex  data  structures. When  these  applications  are  modeled  using  the
relational  model,  they  require  an  excessive  number  of  relations.  In  addition,  a  large  number  of  complex
