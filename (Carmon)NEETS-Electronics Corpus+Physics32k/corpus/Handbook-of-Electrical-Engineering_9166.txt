The IFDHandler allows access to the smart card reader. It is the driver level and the hardware manufacturer
that will normally provide it. PC/SC deÔ¨Ånes the interfaces that the IFDHandler must expose to take place in
the structure. The IFDHandler is the implementation of the functionality required by the exposed functions
to transmit commands to the reader and/or the card. The IFDHandler maps the native capabilities of the smart
card reader to the IFDHandler interface. All distinctions between smart cards based on ISO protocol handling,
whether  synchronous  or  asynchronous,  are  hidden.  Once  installed,  the  IFDhandler  registers  itself  to  the
Resource Manager.
