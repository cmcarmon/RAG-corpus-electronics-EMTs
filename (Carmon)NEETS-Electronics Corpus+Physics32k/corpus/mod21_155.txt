The beam current is also an indication of the power output of the klystron. As klystrons age they
normally draw less beam current; when this current decreases to a minimum value for a specific beam
voltage, the tube must be replaced. You can usually determine the power output of transmitter klystrons
by measuring the transmitter power output during equipment performance checks.
