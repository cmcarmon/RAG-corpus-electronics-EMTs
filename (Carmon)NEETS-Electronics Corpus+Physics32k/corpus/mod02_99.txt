 Just as the example of the boat was used to explain the growth of current in a circuit, it can also be 
used to explain the decay of current in a circuit. When the force applied to the boat is removed, the boat 
still continues to move through the water for a while, eventually coming to a stop. This is because energy 
was being stored in the inertia of the moving boat. After a period of time the friction of the water 
overcomes the inertia of the boat, and the boat stops moving. Just as inertia of the boat stored energy, the 
magnetic field of an inductor stores energy. Because of this, even when the power source is removed, the 
stored energy of the magnetic field of the inductor tends to keep current flowing in the circuit until the 
magnetic field collapse.
