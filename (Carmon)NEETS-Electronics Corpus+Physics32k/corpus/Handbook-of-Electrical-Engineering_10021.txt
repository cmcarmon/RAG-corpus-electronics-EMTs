One  way  of  sketching  phase  plane  behavior  is  to  draw  a  set  of  curves  given  for  various  values  of  r  by  Eq.
(100.141) and marking the trajectory slope r on the curves. This procedure is known as the method of isoclines
and has been used to obtain the limit cycles shown in Fig. 100.51 for the Van der Pol equation with m = 0.2 and 4.
