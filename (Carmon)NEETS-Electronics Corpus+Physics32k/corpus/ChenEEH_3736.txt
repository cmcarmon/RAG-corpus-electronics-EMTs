Dynamic time warping (DTW) is a feature-matching
scheme that uses DP to achieve time alignment between
sequences of reference and test features. The brief description
of DTW presented here is mostly of historical interest and for
its value in introducing the HMM (Deller et al., 2000; Rabiner
and Juang, 1993; Silverman and Morgan, 1990) DTW has been
successfully employed in simple applications requiring rela-
tively straightforward algorithms and minimal hardware. The
technique had its genesis in isolated-word recognition (IWR)
in which words are deliberately spoken in isolation but has also
been applied in a limited way to continuous-speech recogni-
tion (CSR) in which speech is produced naturally without
concern for the recognition process. The approach to CSR
using DTW has been called connected-speech recognition a
sort of hybrid approach in which the continuous speech
(spoken naturally or with minimal
‘‘cooperation’’ by the
talker), is assumed to have been uttered as isolated words.
The DTW process essentially concatenates isolated-word tem-
plates against which to match the ﬂowing speech feature
stream. Details and algorithms used in connected-speech
recognition are found in Chapter 11 of Deller et al. (2000).
Because DTW requires a template (or concatenation of
templates) to be available for any utterance to be recognized,
the method does not generalize well to accommodate the
numerous sources of variation in speech. Therefore, DTW is
not used for complex tasks involving large vocabularies.
