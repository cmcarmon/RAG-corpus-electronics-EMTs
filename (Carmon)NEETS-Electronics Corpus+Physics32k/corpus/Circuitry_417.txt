The  three  basic  configurations  for  operational 
voltage  amplifiers,  together  with  the  expressions 
for their voltage gain, are shown in Fig. 8.7. Supply 
rails  have  been  omitted  from  these  diagrams  for 
clarity  but  are  assumed  to  be  symmetrical  about 
0V. 
  All of the amplifier circuits described previously 
have used direct coupling and thus have frequency 
response characteristics that extend to d.c. This, of 
course, 
is  undesirable  for  many  applications, 
particularly  where  a  wanted  a.c.  signal  may  be 
superimposed on an unwanted d.c. voltage level or 
when  the  bandwidth  of  the  amplifier  greatly 
exceeds  that  of  the  signal  that  it  is  required  to 
amplify.  In  such  cases,  capacitors  of  appropriate 
value  may  be  inserted  in  series  with  the  input 
resistor,  RIN, and  in  parallel  with  the  feedback 
resistor, RF, as shown in Fig. 8.8.  
  The  value  of  the  input  and  feedback  capacitors, 
CIN and CF respectively, are chosen so as to roll-off 
the  frequency  response  of  the  amplifier  at  the 
desired 
lower  and  upper  cut-off  frequencies, 
respectively. The effect of these two capacitors on 
an  operational  amplifierâ€™s  frequency  response  is 
shown in Fig. 8.9. 
  By selecting appropriate values of capacitor, the 
frequency  response  of  an  inverting  operational 
voltage amplifier may be very easily tailored to suit 
a particular set of requirements. 
  The lower cut-off frequency is determined by the 
value  of  the  input  capacitance,  CIN, and  input 
resistance,  RIN. The  lower  cut-off  frequency  is 
given by:
