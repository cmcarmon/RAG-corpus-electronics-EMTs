In a multipath system, the wireless channel is frequency dependent, time dependent, and position dependent. Therefore, the following parameters describe the channel:
Direction of departure(DOD)
Direction of arrival (DOA)
Time delay
Doppler shift
Complex polarimetric path weight matrix
To characterize the propagation path between each transmitter element and each receiver element, engineers transmit a broadband multi-tone test signal. The transmitter's continuous periodic test sequence arrives at the receiver, and is correlated with the original sequence. This impulse-like auto correlation function is called channel impulse response (CIR). By obtaining the transfer function of CIR, we can make an estimation of the channel environment and improve the performance.
