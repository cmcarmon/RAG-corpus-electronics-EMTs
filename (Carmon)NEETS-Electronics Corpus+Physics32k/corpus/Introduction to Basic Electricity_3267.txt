When the gate voltage of a depletion MOSFET is 
made positive, the silicon-dioxide insulating layer pre-
vents any current from flowing through the gate lead. 
The input resistance remains high, and more major-
ity carriers (electrons) are drawn into the channel, 
enhancing the conductivity of the channel. A positive 
gate voltage can be used to increase the MOSFETâ€™s 
drain current, and a negative gate voltage can be used 
to decrease the drain current. Because a negative gate 
voltage is required to deplete the N-channel MOSFET, 
it is called a depletion mode device. A large amount 
of drain current flows when the gate voltage is equal 
to 0. All depletion mode devices are considered to be 
turned on when the gate voltage is equal to 0.
