Linear analysis techniques such as superposition cannot be applied to the whole circuit
because of the nonlinear element. But because there is only one nonlinear device, it is
permissible to find the Th√©venin (or Norton) equivalent circuit faced by the nonlinear
device (see Figures 4.13a and b), because this part of the circuit is linear. Then we
can compute easily the terminal voltage and current for the nonlinear device using the
circuit in Figure 4.13b from Equations 4.11 and 4.12.
