,  the  property  that  the  light  waves  it  contains  are  in
phase with one another. Strictly speaking, all light sources have a Ô¨Ånite coherence length, or distance over which
the light they produce is in phase. However, for conventional light sources that distance is essentially zero. For
many common lasers, it is a fraction of a meter or more, allowing their use for applications requiring coherent
light. The most important of these applications is probably holography, although coherence is useful in some
types of spectroscopy, and there is growing interest in communications using coherent light.
