In
Figure 9.51, suppose that C1 = 1 µF and C2 = 10 µF. Further, suppose that v1 = 10 V
and v2 = 1 V before the switch is closed. How much energy is stored in the two
capacitors before the switch is closed? Also, how much energy is lost during the switch
closure, and what is the common voltage across the capacitors after the switch closes?
