U.S. military rounds designated specifically for the Mk 47 grenade launcher include:
MK285, Programmable Prefragmented High Explosive/Self-Destructible (PPHE/SD)
The MK285 consists of an electronic programmable fuze, a prefragmented warhead and a propulsion system. The fuze is programmed through the fire control of the gun. the fuze is mechanically armed at approximately 23 meters.
The round is programmed to airburst over the target and the fuze counts down the programmed time via its built in electronics. If an unprogrammed round is fired, it will detonate on impact.
The projectile has a built in self-destruct and can be fired by any automatic grenade launcher.
