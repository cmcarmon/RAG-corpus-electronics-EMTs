An analog signal is an electric signal whose value varies in analogy with a physical quantity
such as temperature, force, or acceleration. Sampling of an analog signal makes it discrete in time.
A digital signal, on the other hand, can only have a Ô¨Ånite number of discrete amplitudes at any
given time. Through a process known as quantization, which consists of rounding exact sample
