MOSFETs are continually downscaled for higher packing dens-
ity, higher device speed, and lower power consumption. The
scaling methods are covered later in this chapter in a dedicated
subsection. When physical dimensions of MOSFETs are re-
duced, the equations for drain current have to be modiÔ¨Åed to
account for the so-called short channel effects. The three
primary short channel effects included in this chapter are the
following:
