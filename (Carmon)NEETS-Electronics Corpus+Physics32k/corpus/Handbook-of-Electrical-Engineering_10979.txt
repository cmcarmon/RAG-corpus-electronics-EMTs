Several  journals  treat  engineering  applications  of  neuroelectric  principles,  such  as  IEEE  Transactions  on
Biomedical Engineering, Medical and Biological Engineering and Computing, and Annals of Biomedical Engineering.
Of the many conferences treating bioelectric responses, one having a broad range of applications is the IEEE
