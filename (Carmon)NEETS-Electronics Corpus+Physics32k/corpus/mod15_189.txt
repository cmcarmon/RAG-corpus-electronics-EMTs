When you have reconnected a TX and a TR into a system after zeroing them, you can perform a 
simple check on the system to see if they are accurately on electrical zero. First, place the transmitter on 
0ยบ. When the system reaches the point of correspondence, the induced voltages in the S1 and S3 stator 
windings of both synchros should be equal. Since the terminals of S1 and S3 are at equal potential, a
