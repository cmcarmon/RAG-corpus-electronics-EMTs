Now refer to figure 4-13. When the current starts to flow through the coil, an expanding magnetic 
field builds up around the inductor. This magnetic field around the coil develops the CEMF that opposes 
the change in current. When the rectifier current decreases, as shown in figure 4-14, the magnetic field 
collapses and again cuts the turns (windings) of wire, thus inducing current into the coil. This additional 
current merges with the rectifier current and attempts to keep it at its original level.
