In our Equation 12.4, there is no drive to begin with, so Equation 12.4 is also
the homogeneous equation. Thus, the homogeneous solution is also the total
solution. To obtain the homogeneous solution, we proceed as in Section 10.1.1
for solving first-order homogeneous equations. We expect the homogeneous
solution to our linear, constant-coefficient, ordinary, second-order differential
equation (Equation 12.4) to be a superposition of two terms of the form
