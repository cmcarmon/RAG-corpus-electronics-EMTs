When analyzing the circuits in Figure 4.2 to obtain equation
4.8, we did assume ideal op-amps with inﬁnite gain A and
inﬁnite bandwidth. The designer is cautioned to investigate
very carefully the validity of such an idealized model. Filters de-
signed with ideal op-amps will normally not function correctly
except at the lowest frequencies and for moderate values of Q. A
more appropriate op-amp model that is adequate for most ﬁlter
applications uses the ﬁnite and frequency-dependent gain A(s):
