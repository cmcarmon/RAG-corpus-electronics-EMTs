The way we deﬁne current as i in Eq. (1.1) suggests that current need
not be a constant-valued function. As many of the examples and prob-
lems in this chapter and subsequent chapters suggest, there can be sev-
eral types of current; that is, charge can vary with time in several ways.
If the current does not change with time, but remains constant, we
