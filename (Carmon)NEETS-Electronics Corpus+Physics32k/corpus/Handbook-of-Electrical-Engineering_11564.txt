If sight is lost, how can it be replaced? A simple pair of eyeglasses will not work, because either the sensor
(the  retina),  the  communication  channel  (the  optic  nerve  and  all  of  its  relays  to  the  brain),  or  one  or  more
essential central processors (the occipital part of the cerebral cortex for initial processing; the parietal and other
cortical  areas  for  information  extraction)  has  been  damaged.  For  replacement  within  the  system,  one  must
determine where the visual system has failed and whether a stage of the system can be artiﬁcially bypassed. If
one uses another sensory modality (e.g., touch or hearing) as an alternate input channel, one must determine
whether  there  is  sufﬁcient  bandwidth  in  that  channel  and  whether  the  higher-order  processing  hierarchy  is
plastic enough to process information coming via a different route.
