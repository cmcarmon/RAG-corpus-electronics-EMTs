At low voltage, such as 9 kV, the Ô¨Årst layer of luminescent material is excited and a red color is obtained. At
high voltage, such as 18 kV, the electrons penetrate the red layer without losing much of their energy and excite
the green layer to produce a slightly desaturated green. Typically, only four colors can be produced.
