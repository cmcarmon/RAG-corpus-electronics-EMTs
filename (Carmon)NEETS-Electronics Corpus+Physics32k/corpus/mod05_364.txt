LEFT-HAND RULE FOR GENERATORSâ€”A representation of the relationships between motion,
magnetic force, and resultant current in the generation of a voltage. The thumb, forefinger, and
middle finger of the left hand are extended at right angles to each other. The thumb should point in
the direction the conductor moves. The forefinger should point in the direction of magnetic flux from
north to south. The middle finger will then point in the direction the generated voltage forces current
to flow. Any of three quantities may be found if the other two are known.
