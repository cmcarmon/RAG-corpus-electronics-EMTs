components at various frequencies propagate at the same speed. Transmitted signal amplitude does decay
exponentially along the transmission line. Note that in the high-frequency regime the space constant is small,
which means the signal attenuates little.
6.4 Wireless Channels5
Wireless channels exploit the prediction made by Maxwell’s equation that electromagnetic ﬁelds propagate
in free space like light. When a voltage is applied to an antenna, it creates an electromagnetic ﬁeld that
propagates in all directions (although antenna geometry aﬀects how much power ﬂows in any given direction)
that induces electric currents in the receiver’s antenna. Antenna geometry determines how energetic a ﬁeld
a voltage of a given frequency creates. In general terms, the dominant factor is the relation of the antenna’s
size to the ﬁeld’s wavelength. The fundamental equation relating frequency and wavelength for a propagating
wave is
