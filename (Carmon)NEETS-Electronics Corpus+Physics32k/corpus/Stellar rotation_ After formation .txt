For main-sequence stars, the decline in rotation can be approximated by a mathematical relation:





Ω

{\displaystyle \Omega _{e}\propto t^{-{\frac {1}{2}}}}

where




Ω

e




{\displaystyle \Omega _{e}}
is the angular velocity at the equator and t is the star's age. This relation is named Skumanich's law after Andrew P. Skumanich who discovered it in 1972, but which had actually been proposed much earlier by Evry Schatzman. Gyrochronology is the determination of a star's age based on the rotation rate, calibrated using the Sun.
Stars slowly lose mass by the emission of a stellar wind from the photosphere. The star's magnetic field exerts a torque on the ejected matter, resulting in a steady transfer of angular momentum away from the star. Stars with a rate of rotation greater than 15 km/s also exhibit more rapid mass loss, and consequently a faster rate of rotation decay. Thus as the rotation of a star is slowed because of braking, there is a decrease in rate of loss of angular momentum. Under these conditions, stars gradually approach, but never quite reach, a condition of zero rotation.
