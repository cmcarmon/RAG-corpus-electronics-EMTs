In order to demonstrate the quantum mechanical behaviour, the team first needed to cool the mechanical resonator until it was in its quantum ground state (the state with the lowest possible energy). Specifically, a temperature T ≪ hf/k was required, where h is the Planck Constant, f is the frequency of the resonator and k is the Boltzmann constant. Previous teams of researchers had struggled with this stage, as a 1 MHz resonator, for example, would need to be cooled to the extremely low temperature of 50 μK. O'Connell's team constructed a different type of resonator, a film bulk acoustic resonator, with a much higher resonant frequency (6 GHz) which would hence reach its ground state at a (relatively) higher temperature (~0.1 K); this temperature could then be easily reached with a dilution refrigerator. In the experiment, the resonator was cooled to 25 mK.
