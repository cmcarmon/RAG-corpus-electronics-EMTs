In most electron-tube circuits, the operating level of a tube is determined by the level of bias. When a
negative-bias voltage is applied to the control grid of a tube, with no input signal, the conduction through
the tube is reduced; thus the damage to the tube is minimized. There is one drawback to this. Because the
control grid is already negatively charged by the bias voltage, the negative alternation of a large input
signal will drive the tube into cutoff long before the positive alternation can drive the tube into saturation.
Once the negative alternation reaches a certain level (determined by the bias voltage and tube
characteristics), the tube simply cuts off. For this reason, conventional tubes, which you previously
studied, are called SHARP-CUTOFF TUBES. Because of this sharp cutoff, the range of amplification of
the conventional tube is limited by the bias voltage and tube characteristics. Once this range is exceeded,
the output becomes distorted due to cutoff.
