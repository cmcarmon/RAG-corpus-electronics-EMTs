room lights can be controlled by either a switch, a binary or two-state device,
or a dimmer, a continuous control device. Chapter 6 will introduce another
multi-terminal device called the MOSFET in which a control voltage between
one pair of terminals of the device determines the MOSFETâ€™s behavior between
another pair of terminals. Thus, when the multi-terminal dependent source is
connected in a circuit, the behavior of the device can be controlled by a voltage
or current in some other part of the circuit.
