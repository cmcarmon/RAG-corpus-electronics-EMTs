Information waveforms are produced by many different sources and are generally quite low in 
frequency. A good example is the human voice. The frequencies involved in normal speech vary from one 
individual to another and cover a wide range. This range can be anywhere from a low of about 90 hertz 
for a deep bass to as high as 10 kilohertz for a high soprano.
