An oscillator can be thought of as an amplifier that provides itself (through feedback) with an input 
signal. By definition, it is a nonrotating device for producing alternating current, the output frequency of 
which is determined by the characteristics of the device. The primary purpose of an oscillator is to 
generate a given waveform at a constant peak amplitude and specific frequency and to maintain this 
waveform within certain limits of amplitude and frequency.
