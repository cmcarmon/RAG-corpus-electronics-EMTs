The structure of Maxwell relations is a statement of equality among the second derivatives for continuous functions. It follows directly from the fact that the order of differentiation of an analytic function of two variables is irrelevant (Schwarz theorem). In the case of Maxwell relations the function considered is a thermodynamic potential and xi and xj are two different natural variables for that potential:

where the partial derivatives are taken with all other natural variables held constant. It is seen that for every thermodynamic potential there are n(n âˆ’ 1)/2 possible Maxwell relations where n is the number of natural variables for that potential. The substantial increase in the entropy will be verified according to the relations satisfied by the laws of thermodynamics
