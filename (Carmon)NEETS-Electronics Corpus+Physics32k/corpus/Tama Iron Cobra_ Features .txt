Since the beginning the Iron Cobra was known for adjustability. Through all the generations, the pedal has had the ability to adjust the footboard angle independently of the beater shaft angle, adjust the beater head angle, adjust the hoop clamp size, adjust the beater shaft length, adjust the feel of the beater with a sliding weight, and adjust the spring tension. Not all of these adjustments are universally possible on all other pedals from other manufacturers. The cam shape is not adjustable on the Iron Cobra, except on the third gen. duo-glide model, but the pedal has historically been offered with two different optional cams. The rolling-glide cam is round for a smooth action, while the powerglide cam changes radius mid-stroke for more acceleration. While most of the Iron Cobra pedals are double chain drive, the flexi-glide version has a kevlar strap drive. Since at least the second generation, the pedals have come with a hard plastic carrying case.
