Venus has a very well observed and predictable orbit. From the perspective of all but the most demanding its orbit is simple. An equation in Astronomical Algorithms that assumes an unperturbed elliptical orbit predicts the perihelion and aphelion times with an error of a few hours. Using orbital elements to calculate those distances agrees to actual averages to at least five significant figures. Formulas for computing position straight from orbital elements typically do not provide or need corrections for the effects of other planets.
However, observations are much better now, and space age technology has replaced the older techniques. E. Myles Standish wrote Classical ephemerides over the past centuries have been based entirely upon optical observations:almost exclusively, meridian circle transit timings. With the advent of planetary radar, spacecraft missions, VLBI, etc., the situation for the four inner planets has changed dramatically. For DE405, created in 1998, optical observations were dropped and as he wrote initial conditions for the inner four planets were adjusted to ranging data primarily... Now the orbit estimates are dominated by observations of the Venus Express spacecraft. The orbit is now known to sub-kilometer accuracy.
