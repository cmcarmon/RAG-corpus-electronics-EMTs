Figure 4-28 shows a pure square wave that is applied to a series-resistive circuit. If the values of the 
two resistors are equal, the voltage developed across each resistor will be equal; that is, from one pure 
square-wave input, two pure square waves of a lower amplitude will be produced. The value of the 
resistors does not affect the phase or amplitude relationships of the harmonics contained within the square 
waves. This is true because the same opposition is offered by the resistors to all the harmonics presented. 
However, if the same square wave is applied to a series RC circuit, as shown in figure 4-29, the circuit 
action is not the same.
