According to the programs stored and the parameters entered, the machine initially mixes
the ingredients for several minutes. The heating resistor is turned on to warm the yeast, causing
the dough to rise while a temperature of about 90°F is maintained. The time remaining and the
temperature are continually checked until the baked loaf is cooled, and the ﬁnished bread is ﬁnally
ready in about 4 hours.
