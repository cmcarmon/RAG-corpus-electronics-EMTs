Perhaps the most interesting method presents an image of the scanned data directly to the visual cortex or
retina  via  an  array  of  implantable  electrodes  that  are  used  to  electrically  activate  nearby  cortical  or  retinal
structures. The visual cortex and retina are laid out in topographic fashion such that there is an orderly mapping
of the signal from different parts of the visual ﬁeld to the retina, and from the retina to corresponding parts
of the occipital cortex. The goal of stimulation is to mimic the neural activity that would have been evoked
had the signal come through normal channels. And, such stimulation does produce the sensation of light. Since
. However,
the “image” stays within the visual system, the rehabilitation solution is said to be 
substantial problems dealing with biocompatibility and image processing and reduction remain in the design
of the electrode arrays and processors that serve to interface the electronics and neurological tissue.
