During 1996, the ROSAT All Sky Survey discovered another nearby supernova remnant, RX J1713.7-3946, which two years later, was suggested as a better match for SN 393. Observations in 1999 suggested that this remnant was associated with H II region, G347.611 +0.204, whose distance was about 6,000 pc (20,000 ly), but in 2003, examining interactions between a nearby molecular cloud and the expanding remnant found the closer distance of around 1,000 pc (3,000 ly). In 2004, measures of the degree of X-ray and neutral hydrogen absorption by intervening matter between the remnant and Earth, confirmed this closer distance, making the true physical remnant diameter as 20 pc (65 ly), assuming the apparent angular diameter of about 1.2° or 70 arcminutes.
Supernova remnant RX J1713.7-3946 is consistent with type II or type Ib supernovae. SN 393's progenitor had a mass of at least 15 solar masses, whose destruction generated energies of about 1.3 × 1051 erg, with three solar masses of material ejected into the surrounding interstellar medium.
