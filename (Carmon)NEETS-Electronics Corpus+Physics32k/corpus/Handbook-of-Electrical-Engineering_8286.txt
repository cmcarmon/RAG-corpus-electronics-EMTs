LFSRs as Pseudo-Random Pattern Generators
An autonomous LFSR is a clocked synchronous shift register augmented with appropriate feedback taps and
receiving no external input [Bardell et al., 1987; Abramovici, 1992]. It is an example of a general linear ﬁnite
 ﬂip-ﬂops and the next state operations are implemented
state machine, where the memory cells are simple 
= 3. An LFSR of length 
k
by EXOR gates only. Figure 85.6 shows an example of an autonomous LFSR of length 
 where the nonzero coefﬁcients of the
can be described by a polynomial with binary coefﬁcients of degree 
x
polynomial denote the positions of the respective feedback taps. In Fig. 85.6, the high-order coefﬁcient for 
3
 is 0, and thus no feedback
is 1, and thus there is a feedback tap from the rightmost cell 
x
 and to the leftmost stage since

s
tap exists after cell 
1
coefﬁcients. Since this is an autonomous LFSR, there is no external input to the leftmost cell.
