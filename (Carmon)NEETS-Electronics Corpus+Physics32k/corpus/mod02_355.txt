PHASEâ€”The angular relationship between two alternating currents or voltages when the voltage or
current is plotted as a function of time. When the two are in phase, the angle is zero, and both reach
their peak simultaneously. When out of phase, one will lead or lag the other; at the instant when one
is at its peak, the other will not be at peak value and (depending on the phase angle) may differ in
polarity as well as magnitude.
