MOS Levels 1, 2, and 3. Originally, SPICE came with three MOS models known as level 1, level 2, and level 3.
The level 1 MOS model is a very crude ﬁrst-order model that is rarely used. The level 2 and level 3 MOS models
are extensions of the level 1 model and have been used extensively in the past and present [Vladimirescu and
Liu, 1980]. These two models contain about 15 DC parameters each and are usually considered useful for digital
circuit simulation down to 1 mm channel length technologies. They can ﬁt the drain current for wide transistors
of varying length with reasonable accuracy (about 5% RMS error), but have very little advanced ﬁtting capability
for analog application. They have only one parameter for ﬁtting the subthreshold region, and no parameters
for ﬁtting the derivative of drain current with respect to drain voltage, Gds (usually considered critical for analog
applications). They also have no ability to vary the mobility degradation with back-bias, so the ﬁts to Ids in the
saturation region at high back-bias are not very good. Finally, these models do not interpolate well over device
