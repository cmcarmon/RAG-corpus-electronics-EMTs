Hybrid Circuits and Directional Couplers
Hybrid circuits are multiport components which preferentially route a signal incident at one port to the other
ports. This property is called directivity. One type of hybrid is called a directional coupler, the schematic of
which is shown in Fig. 39.8(a). Here the signal incident at port 1 is coupled to ports 2 and 3 while very little
is  coupled  to  port  4.  Similarly,  a  signal  incident  at  port  2  is  coupled  to  ports  1  and  4  but  very  little  power
appears at port 3. The feature that distinguishes a directional coupler from other types of hybrids is that the
power at the output ports (here ports 2 and 3) is different. The performance of a directional coupler is speciÔ¨Åed
by three parameters:
