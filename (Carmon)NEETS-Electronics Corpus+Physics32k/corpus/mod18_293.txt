To examine the operation of the transmitter, we will trace the signal through the entire circuit. The
local oscillator shown at the left of figure 2-10 is a very stable rf oscillator that produces two cw rf
outputs. As shown, the cw output is sent to the receiver system; the cw output is also one of the two rf
signals fed to the mixer amplifier by way of the two BUFFER AMPLIFIER STAGES. The buffer
amplifiers raise the power level of the signal and also isolate the local oscillator.
