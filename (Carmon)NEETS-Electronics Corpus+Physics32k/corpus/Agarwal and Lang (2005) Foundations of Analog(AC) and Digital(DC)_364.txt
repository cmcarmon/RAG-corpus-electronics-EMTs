is supplying power to the rest of the circuit. Further, assume that the voltage VO is of
interest to us. Notice also that the two voltages VS and VO share a common negative
reference node. A power supply voltage source and a common voltage reference will be
encountered so commonly in our circuit language that it is worth creating an idiomatic
representation for them.
