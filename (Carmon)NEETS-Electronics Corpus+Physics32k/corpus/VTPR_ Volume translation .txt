VTPR implements a correction to the pure component densities resp. volume. This volume translation corrects systematic deviations of the Peng–Robinson equation of state (PR EOS). The translation constant is obtained by determining the difference between the calculated density at Tr=0.7 and the real value of the density obtained from experimental data. Tr is close to the normal boiling point for many substances. The volume translation constant ci

is therefore component specific.
This volume/density translation is then applied to the complete density/volume curve calculated by the PR EOS. This is sufficient because the calculated curve has the right slope and is only shifted.
The Peng–Robinson equation of state is then
