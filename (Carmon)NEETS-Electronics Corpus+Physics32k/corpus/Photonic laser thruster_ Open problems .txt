To date the experimental tests of the photonic thruster are limited to laboratory-scale distances. The maximum range of operation for a photonic laser thruster, PLT, is yet to be established. Bohn demonstrated a 1 km-long laser resonator similar to the PLT cavity, which is an active cavity, in 1995 and proposed that such resonators could scale to 100 km. Recently, 4-km  Fabry–Pérot cavities, which are passive cavities, but share the same intracavity power multiplication principle with the PLT cavity, have been demonstrated in LIGO for gravitational wave detection with an intracavity multiplication factor of 280 and an intracavity laser power on the order of 100 kW. Based on these results and the state-of-the-art technologies in precision optics, the PLT cavity length over 1,000 km is promising. Further studies need to be performed to determine whether the PLT cavity could be scaled for astronomical distances.
Likewise, use of the amplifying cavity has not yet been demonstrated for the case when the sail is moving at velocities approaching fractions of the light velocity. The Doppler shift of the moving sail will, as noted earlier, mean that the amplification medium will need to operate at a different wavelength for each pass of the photons through the system. The mode of the Fabry-Perot cavity will likewise be changing with time.
Another issue is intracavity laser beam aiming, aligning and tracking over long distances. Progress in directed energy weapons has improved these capabilities. The speed of light limits how quickly tracking information can travel between the two cavity ends over long distances.
At speeds higher than rocket speeds lack of brakes is a problem. Such a problem can be solved by installing another photonic laser thruster at the destination as in photonic railway. The braking of spacecraft with PLT in lab has been recently demonstrated.
