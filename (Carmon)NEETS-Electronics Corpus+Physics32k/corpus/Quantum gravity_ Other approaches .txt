There are a number of other approaches to quantum gravity. The approaches differ depending on which features of general relativity and quantum theory are accepted unchanged, and which features are modified. Examples include:
Asymptotic safety in quantum gravity
Euclidean quantum gravity
Causal dynamical triangulation
Causal fermion systems
Covariant Feynman path integral approach
Group field theory
Wheeler–DeWitt equation
Geometrodynamics
Hořava–Lifshitz gravity
MacDowell–Mansouri action
Path-integral based models of quantum cosmology
Regge calculus
Scale relativity
Shape Dynamics
String-nets and quantum graphity
Superfluid vacuum theory a.k.a. theory of BEC vacuum
Supergravity
Twistor theory
Canonical quantum gravity
E8 Theory
Quantum holonomy theory
