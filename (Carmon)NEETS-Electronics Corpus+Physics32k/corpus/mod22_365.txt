To represent numeric, alphabetic, and special characters in a computer's internal storage and on 
magnetic media, we must use some sort of coding system. In computers, the code is made up of fixed size 
groups of binary positions. Each binary position in a group is assigned a specific value; for example 8, 4, 
2, or 1. In this way, every character can be represented by a combination of bits that is different from any 
other combination.
