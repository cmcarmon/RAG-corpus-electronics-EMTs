In this circuit, the current supplied by the battery is limited by the total 
resistance of the circuit, which is 2.65 kΩ. Supply current flows from the posi­
tive battery terminal through resistor R1, splits — with half flowing through 
resistor R2 and half flowing through resistor R3 (because those resistances 
are the same) — and then combines again to flow into the negative battery 
terminal.
