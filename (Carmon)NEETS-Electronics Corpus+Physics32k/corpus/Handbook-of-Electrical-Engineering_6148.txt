Make sure that programs you use are designed to do the job you require. Some programs make assumptions
which give satisfactory results in most cases but may not be adequate for your particular case. No matter how
sophisticated and friendly the program may appear, it is the algorithm and processing of data which are the
most  important  parts.  As  programs  become  more  complex  and  integrated,  new  errors  (regressions)  can  be
introduced. Wherever possible check the answers and always make sure they feel right.
