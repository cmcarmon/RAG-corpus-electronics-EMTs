Photodiodes and Solar Cells
Photodiodes are ordinary pn-diodes that generate hole–electron pairs when exposed to light. A photocurrent
ﬂows  across  the  junction,  if  the  diode  is  reverse  biased.  Silicon pn-junctions  are  used  to  sense  light  at  near-
infrared and visible spectra around 0.9 mm. Other materials are used for different spectra.
