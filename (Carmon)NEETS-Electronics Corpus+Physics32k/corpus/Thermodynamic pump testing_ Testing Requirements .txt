Another key difference between the two methods is test setup requirements. The conventional method requires more stringent piping requirements, usually requiring greater than 5 diameters of straight pipe upstream of the flow meter in order to provide the quoted flow accuracy. The thermodynamic method, however, typically requires only 1-2 diameters of straight pipe upstream of the equipment in order to achieve quoted accuracies. Consequently, the thermodynamic method is often able to perform field tests which cannot be performed by a conventional test.
