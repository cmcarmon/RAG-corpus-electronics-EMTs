In 1961, MÃ¸ller showed that a tetrad description of gravitational fields allows a more rational treatment of the energy-momentum complex than in a theory based on the metric tensor alone. The advantage of using tetrads as gravitational variables was connected with the fact that this allowed to construct expressions for the energy-momentum complex which had more satisfactory transformation properties than in a purely metric formulation. Recently it has been shown that total energy of matter and gravitation is proportional to Ricci scalar of three-space up to linear order of perturbation.
