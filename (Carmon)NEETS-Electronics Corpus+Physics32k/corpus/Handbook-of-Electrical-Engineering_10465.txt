Accurate 3D kinematic models of the robot and work space components allow the operator to preplan
and  optimize  robot  trajectories  before  the  program  is  automatically  generated.  Control  commands  are
monitored when running in autonomous, teleoperational, or shared control modes to assure procedural safety.
