k   is

Boltzmann’s constant, and  T  is the temperature of the semiconductor. Around the knee of the curve in Fig. 5.2
is a positive voltage that is termed the turn-on or sometimes the threshold voltage for the diode. This value is
an approximate voltage above which the diode is considered turned “on” and can be modeled to ﬁrst degree
as a closed switch with constant forward drop. Below the threshold voltage value the diode is considered weakly
conducting and approximated as an open switch. The exponential relationship shown in Eq. (5.1) means that
the diode forward current can change by orders of magnitude before there is a large change in diode voltage,
thus providing the simple circuit model during conduction. The nonlinear relationship of Eq. (5.1) also provides
a means of frequency mixing for applications in modulation circuits.
