Figure 15.2.4(a) depicts the waveforms of the message signal and its amplitude spectrum; Figure
15.2.4(b) shows the DSB waveform sDSB(t), and Figure 15.2.4(c) displays the amplitude spectrum
of sDSB(t). From Equation (15.2.6) with Ac = 0, the efﬁciency of DSB SC AM comes out as 1.0,
or 100%. While the power efﬁciency is increased, there will be added complexity, especially in
the demodulator.
