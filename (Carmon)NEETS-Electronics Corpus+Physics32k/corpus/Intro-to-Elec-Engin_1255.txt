13.3.6 For a 45-kVA, three-phase, wye-connected, 220-
V synchronous machine at rated armature cur-
rent, the short-circuit load loss (total for three
phases) is 1.80 kW at a temperature of 25°C. The
dc resistance of the armature at this temperature
is 0.0335  per phase. Compute the effective
armature ac resistance in per unit and in ohms
per phase at 25°C.
