Sensors, or input transducers, take one form of energy and convert it into 
electrical energy, which is fed into the input of an electronic circuit. Output 
transducers do the opposite: They take the electronic signal at the output of 
a circuit and convert it into another form of energy â€” for instance, sound, 
light, or motion (which is mechanical energy).
