The electrodynamic wattmeter may be converted into an instrument for measuring reactive power by 
replacing the resistance normally in series with the voltage coil with a large inductance. A 90-degree 
current lag within the voltage coil provides a direct reading proportional to the reactive power in the 
circuit. Compensating networks must be used to cause the phase shift to be exactly 90ยบ.
