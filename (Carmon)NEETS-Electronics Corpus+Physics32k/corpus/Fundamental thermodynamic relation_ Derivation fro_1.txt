The first law of thermodynamics states that:





d

U
=
δ
Q
−
δ
W



{\displaystyle \mathrm {d} U=\delta Q-\delta W\,}

where



δ
Q


{\displaystyle \delta Q}
and



δ
W


{\displaystyle \delta W}
are infinitesimal amounts of heat supplied to the system by its surroundings and work done by the system on its surroundings, respectively.
According to the second law of thermodynamics we have for a reversible process:





d

S
=



δ
Q

T





{\displaystyle \mathrm {d} S={\frac {\delta Q}{T}}\,}

Hence:




δ
Q
=
T


d

S



{\displaystyle \delta Q=T\,\mathrm {d} S\,}

By substituting this into the first law, we have:





d

U
=
T


d

S
−
δ
W



{\displaystyle \mathrm {d} U=T\,\mathrm {d} S-\delta W\,}

Letting



δ
W


{\displaystyle \delta W}
be reversible pressure-volume work done by the system on its surroundings,




δ
W

=
P

d

V



{\displaystyle \delta W\ =P\mathrm {d} V\,}

we have:





d

U

d

P


d

V



{\displaystyle \mathrm {d} U=T\,\mathrm {d} S-P\,\mathrm {d} V\,}

This equation has been derived in the case of reversible changes. However, since U, S, and V are thermodynamic state functions, the above relation holds also for non-reversible changes in a system of uniform pressure and temperature at constant composition. If the composition, i.e. the amounts

{\displaystyle n_{i}}
of the chemical components, in a system of uniform temperature and pressure can also change, e.g. due to a chemical reaction, the fundamental thermodynamic relation generalizes to:

The

If the system has more external parameters than just the volume that can change, the fundamental thermodynamic relation generalizes to
