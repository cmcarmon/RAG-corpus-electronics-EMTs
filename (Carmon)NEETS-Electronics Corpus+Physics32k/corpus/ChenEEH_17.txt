The voltage or potential difference (VAB) between two points
A and B is the amount of energy required to move a unit
positive charge from B to A. If this energy is positive, that is
work is done by external sources against forces on the charges,
then VAB is positive and point A is at a higher potential with
respect to B. The voltage is measured using the unit of volt [V].
The voltage between two points is 1 V if 1 J (joule) of work is
required to move 1 C of charge. If the voltage, v, between two
points is constant, then the work, w, done in moving q cou-
lombs of charge between the two points is given by:
