Comparison between Cartesian and Curvilinear grids shows that in Cartesian grid cells are wasted in dealing with objects. The distribution of function is very fine in curvilinear grid. The resources required in curvilinear grids are less as compared to Cartesian grids thus saving lots of memory. Therefore, we can say that coarse grids are able to capture flow details efficiently.
