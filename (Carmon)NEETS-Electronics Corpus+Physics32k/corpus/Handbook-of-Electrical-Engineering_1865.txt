Luckily,  VLSI  technology  is  also  advancing  rapidly  and  allows  us  to  build  ever  more  sophisticated  video
processing architectures. The state of video processing architectures will continue to advance as VLSI allows us
to integrate more transistors on a chip; in particular, the ability to integrate a signiÔ¨Åcant amount of memory
along with multiple processing elements will provide great strides in video processing performance over the
next several years. However, the basic techniques for video processing used today [Pir98] will continue to be
the basis for video architectures in the long run.
