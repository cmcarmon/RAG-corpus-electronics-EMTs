Voltage and current source equivalence in ac circuits:
An ac voltage source in series with an impedance can be
replaced across the same terminals by an equivalent ac current
source of the same frequency in parallel with an admittance, as
shown in Figure 1.28. Similarly, an ac current source in parallel
with an admittance can be replaced across the same terminals
by an equivalent ac voltage source of the same frequency in
series with an impedance.
