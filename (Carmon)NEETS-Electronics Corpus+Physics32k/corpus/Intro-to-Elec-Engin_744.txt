(8.5.1)
which is shown in Figure 8.5.1. When both ωL and ωH have signiﬁcant values, the ampliﬁer
is known as a bandpass ampliﬁer. A narrow-bandpass ampliﬁer is one in which W3dB is small
relative to the center frequency of the midband region. In a low-pass unit (dc ampliﬁer) there is
no low 3-dB frequency.
