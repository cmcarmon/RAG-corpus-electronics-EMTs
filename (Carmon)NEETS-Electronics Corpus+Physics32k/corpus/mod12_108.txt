OSCILLATOR KEYING.â€”Two methods of OSCILLATOR KEYING are shown in figure 1-23. 
In view (A) the grid circuit is closed at all times. The key (K) opens and closes the negative side of the 
plate circuit. This system is called PLATE KEYING. When the key is open, no plate current can flow and 
the circuit does not oscillate. In view (B), the cathode circuit is open when the key is open and neither 
grid current nor plate current can flow. Both circuits are closed when the key is closed. This system is 
called CATHODE KEYING. Although the circuits of figure 1-23 may be used to key amplifiers, other 
keying methods are generally employed because of the high values of plate current and voltage 
encountered.
