These participation factors may be proportional to the inverse of the second derivative of the cost of unit
generation so that the units would be loaded according to their costs, thus meeting the third objective. However,
cost may not be the only consideration because the different units may have different response rates and it may
be necessary to move the faster generators more to obtain an acceptable response. The UCEs are then sent to
the various units under control and the generating units monitored to see that the corrections take place. This
control action is repeated every 2 to 6 s.
