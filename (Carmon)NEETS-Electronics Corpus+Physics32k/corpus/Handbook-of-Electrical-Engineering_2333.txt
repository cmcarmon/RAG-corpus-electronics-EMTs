Low-Frequency  Large-Signal  Equivalent  Circuit  Model  of  a  BJT. 
 In  this  case,  low  frequency  denotes  fre-
quencies  below  10  kHz.  The  low-frequency  large-signal  equivalent  circuit  model  of  a  BJT  is  based  on  its  dc
characteristics. Whereas at high frequencies one has to take incremental values to obtain accurate analysis, at
low  frequencies,  the  average  of  these  incremental  values  yields  the  same  level  of  accuracy  in  the  analysis.
Therefore,  in  low-frequency  analysis,  the  circuit  elements  of  the  high-frequency  model  are  replaced  by  their
average values. The low-frequency large-signal equivalent circuit model is shown in Fig. 22.26.
