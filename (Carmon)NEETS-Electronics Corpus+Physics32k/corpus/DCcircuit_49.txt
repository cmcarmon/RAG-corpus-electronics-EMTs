A noteworthy observation may be made here. As each electron moves uniformly through
a conductor, it pushes on the one ahead of it, such that all the electrons move together as a
group. The starting and stopping of electron ﬂow through the length of a conductive path is
virtually instantaneous from one end of a conductor to the other, even though the motion of
each electron may be very slow. An approximate analogy is that of a tube ﬁlled end-to-end with
marbles:
