Nonsinusoidal oscillators generate complex waveforms such as those just discussed. Because the 
outputs of these oscillators are generally characterized by a sudden change, or relaxation, these oscillators 
are often called RELAXATION OSCILLATORS. The pulse repetition rate of these oscillators is usually 
governed by the charge and discharge timing of a capacitor in series with a resistor. However, some 
oscillators contain inductors that, along with circuit resistance, affect the output frequency. These RC and 
LC networks within oscillator circuits are used for frequency determination. Within this category of 
relaxation oscillators are MULTIVIBRATORS, BLOCKING OSCILLATORS, and SAWTOOTH- and 
TRAPEZOIDAL-WAVE GENERATORS.
