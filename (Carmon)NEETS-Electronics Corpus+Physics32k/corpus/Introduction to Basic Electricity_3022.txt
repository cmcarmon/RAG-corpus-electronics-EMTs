Independent electrical charges exist in each type 
of semiconductor material, because electrons are free 
to drift. The electrons and holes that drift are referred 
to as mobile charges. In addition to the mobile 
charges, each atom that gains an electron has more 
electrons than protons and assumes a negative charge. 
Similarly, each atom that loses an electron has more  
protons than electrons and therefore assumes a  positive 
charge. As described in Chapter 10, these  individual 
charged atoms are called negative and  positive ions. 
There is always an equal number of  mobile and ionic 
charges within N-type and P-type semiconductor 
materials.
