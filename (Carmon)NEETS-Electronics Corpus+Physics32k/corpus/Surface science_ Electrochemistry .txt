The behavior of an electrode-electrolyte interface is affected by the distribution of ions within the electrical double layer. Adsorption and desorption events can be studied at atomically flat single crystal surfaces as a function of applied bias, time, and solution conditions using scanning probe microscopy and surface X-ray scattering. These studies link traditional electrochemical techniques such as cyclic voltammetry to direct observations of interfacial processes.
