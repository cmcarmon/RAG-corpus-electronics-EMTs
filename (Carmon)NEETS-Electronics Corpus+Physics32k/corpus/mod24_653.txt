For medium-distance, medium-data-rate systems, ELEDs are preferred. ELEDs may be modulated at
rates up to 400 Mb/s. ELEDs may be used for both single mode and multimode fiber systems. Both SLDs
and ELEDs are used in long-distance, high-data-rate systems. SLDs are ELED-based diodes designed to
operate in the superluminescence mode. A further discussion on superluminescence is provided later in
this chapter. SLDs may be modulated at bit rates of over 400 Mb/s.
