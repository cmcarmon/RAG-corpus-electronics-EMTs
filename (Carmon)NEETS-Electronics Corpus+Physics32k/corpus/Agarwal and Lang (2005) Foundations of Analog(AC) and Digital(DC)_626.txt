intuitive approach suggested in Section 2.4 involving first collapsing, then
expanding the circuit. Suppose we knew the voltage vx at node x, then we can
easily obtain vBV by the voltage divider relation. We can obtain vx by first
collapsing the circuit in Figure 4.30b into the equivalent circuit in Figure 4.31
and applying the voltage divider relation. Rx in the circuit in Figure 4.31 is
found by collapsing the 1-k, 5-k, 3-k, and the 100- resistances into an
equivalent resistance as follows:
