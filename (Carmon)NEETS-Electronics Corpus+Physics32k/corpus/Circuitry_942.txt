Notation 
 
The  standard  notation  used 
in  mathematics 
provides us with a shorthand that helps to simplify 
the  writing  of  mathematical  expressions.  Notation 
is based on the use of symbols that you will already 
recognize. These include =  (equals), + (addition), - 
(subtraction),  ×  (multiplication),  and  ¸  (division). 
Other symbols that you may not be so familiar with 
include  < 
than),  W
(proportional to) and Ö (square root).
