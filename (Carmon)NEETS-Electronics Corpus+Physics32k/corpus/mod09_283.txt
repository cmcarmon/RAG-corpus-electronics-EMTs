When a voltage is applied to the circuit, current from the battery flows through coil L1 and to the 
emitter through RE. Current then flows from the emitter to the collector and back to the battery. The surge 
of current through coil L1 induces a voltage in coil L2 to start oscillations within the tank circuit.
