For  all  the  difﬁculties,  Kennedy  Space  Center  and  its  prime  contractor  for  shuttle  processing —
Lockheed Space Operations Company (LSOC) — are doing an outstanding job of managing OPF oper-
ations with the help of a number of processing innovations in recent years. One of the most important
is  the  Ground  Processing  Scheduling  System,  or  GPSS.  The  GPSS  is  a  software  system  for  enhancing
efﬁciency  by  providing  an  automated  scheduling  tool  that  predicts  conﬂicts  between  scheduled  tasks,
helps human schedulers resolve those conﬂicts, and searches for near-optimal schedules.
