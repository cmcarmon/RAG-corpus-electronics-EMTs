such as in random-access memories or RAMs. In some
cases, the ROMs can be made electrically alterable
(Â¼ write-few) with high energies (EAROM) or pro-
grammable by means of fuses (PROM), for example.
Only the R/W memories will be discussed further on.
2. Volatile or not: For R/W memories, the data are usu-
ally removed once the power goes down. In some cases,
this can be avoided, but these nonvolatile options are
expensive and slow. Examples are magnetic media and
tapes that are intended for slow access of mass data.
This discussion is restricted to the most common case
on chip, namely, the volatile one.
