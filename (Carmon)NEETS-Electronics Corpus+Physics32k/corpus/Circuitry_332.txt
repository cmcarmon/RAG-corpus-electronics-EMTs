Many  different  types  of  amplifier  are  found  in 
electronic circuits. Before we explain the operation 
of  transistor  amplifiers  in  detail,  we  shall  briefly 
describe the main types of amplifier. 
 
a.c. coupled amplifiers 
 
In  a.c.  coupled  amplifiers,  stages  are  coupled 
together in such a way that d.c. levels are isolated 
and  only  the  a.c.  components  of  a  signal  are 
transferred from stage to stage. 
 
d.c. coupled amplifiers 
 
In  d.c.  (or  direct)  coupled  amplifiers,  stages  are 
coupled together in such a way that stages are not 
isolated to  d.c. potentials. Both a.c. and d.c. signal 
components are transferred from stage to stage. 
 
Large-signal amplifiers 
 
Large-signal  amplifiers  are  designed  to  cater  for  
appreciable voltage and/or current levels (typically 
from 1V to 100 V or more). 
 
Small-signal amplifiers 
 
Small-signal  amplifiers  are  designed  to  cater  for 
low-level signals (normally less than 1V and often 
much  smaller).  Small-signal  amplifiers  have  to  be 
specially designed to combat the effects of noise.
