The general problem is the following. When a cell u is
replaced by another cell v along a reconﬁguration path, a net
ni connected to u may need its route to be extended to connect
to v [as shown for u ¼ the dark node B2 and v ¼ C2 in Figure
8.8(A) if the current route of ni does not include the required
track segment. The required extension is the CS. For each CS,
if the required interconnect segment where the CS is to be
inserted is vacant, the net extension is straightforward, and no
other nets are disturbed. If the required interconnect segment
is occupied by another net, then the CS insertion will cause a
displacement or ‘‘bumping’’ of this net. The net requiring the
CS extension is termed the CS-net [n1 in Figure 8.8(A)], and
the net occupying the required track segment is termed the
occupying net or O-net [n2 in Figure 8.8(A)].
