The definition of an adiabatic process is that heat transfer to the system is zero, δQ = 0. Then, according to the first law of thermodynamics,





(1)


d
U

δ
W
=
δ
Q
=
0
,


{\displaystyle {\text{(1)}}\qquad dU+\delta W=\delta Q=0,}

where dU is the change in the internal energy of the system and δW is work done by the system. Any work (δW) done must be done at the expense of internal energy U, since no heat δQ is being supplied from the surroundings. Pressure–volume work δW done by the system is defined as





(2)

.


{\displaystyle {\text{(2)}}\qquad \delta W=P\,dV.}

However, P does not remain constant during an adiabatic process but instead changes along with V.
It is desired to know how the values of dP and dV relate to each other as the adiabatic process proceeds. For an ideal gas the internal energy is given by





(3)


U
=
α
n
R
T
,


{\displaystyle {\text{(3)}}\qquad U=\alpha nRT,}

where α is the number of degrees of freedom divided by two, R is the universal gas constant and n is the number of moles in the system (a constant).
Differentiating Equation (3) and use of the ideal gas law, PV = nRT, yields

{\displaystyle {\text{(4)}}\qquad dU=\alpha nR\,dT=\alpha \,d(PV)=\alpha (P\,dV+V\,dP).}

Equation (4) is often expressed as dU = nCV dT because CV = αR.
Now substitute equations (2) and (4) into equation (1) to obtain

{\displaystyle -(\alpha +1){dV \over V}=\alpha {dP \over P}.}

Exponentiate both sides, and substitute α + 1/α with γ, the heat capacity ratio
