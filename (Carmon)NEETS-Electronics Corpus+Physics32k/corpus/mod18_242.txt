When a low voltage is applied to a magnetron, the magnetron produces a noise voltage output
instead of oscillations. If this noise enters the receiver, it can completely mask the returning echoes. If a
modulator pulse builds up and decays slowly, noise is produced at both the beginning and end of the
pulse. Therefore, for efficient radar operation, a magnetron requires a modulator pulse that has a flat top
and steep leading and trailing edges. An effective modulator pulse must perform in the following manner:
