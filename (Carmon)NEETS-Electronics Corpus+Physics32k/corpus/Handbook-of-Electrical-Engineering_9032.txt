very consistent drop breakoff and diameter. Operation at frequencies in excess of 100 kHz is possible with drop
velocities of typically 25 m/s with a 50-mm nozzle diameter. Because the drops must be electrostatically charged
at  the  breakoff  point,  conductive  ink  must  be  used.  The  ink  source  is  typically  grounded  and  a  controllable
voltage electrode is placed at the breakoff point (usually surrounding the jet stream). The charge level on each
drop is then proportional to the applied voltage. Each charged drop can then be deﬂected by parallel downstream
deﬂection  plates  with  a  ﬁeld  of  typically  10  kV/cm.  This  deﬂection  (assuming  parallel  plates  and  a  uniform
electric ﬁeld between the plates) can be approximated by:
