Impedance 
 
Figure 4.11 shows two circuits which contain both 
resistance and reactance. These circuits are said to 
exhibit impedance (a combination of resistance and 
reactance)  which,  like  resistance  and  reactance,  is 
measured in ohms.  
  The impedance of the circuits shown in Fig. 4.11 
is simply the ratio of supply voltage, VS, to supply 
current, IS. The impedance of the simple C–R and 
L–R  circuits  shown  in  Fig.  4.11  can  be  found  by 
using  the  impedance  triangle  shown  in  Fig.  4.12.    
In either case, the impedance of the circuit is given 
by: 
Z
and  the  phase  angle  (between  VS and  IS) is  given 
by:
