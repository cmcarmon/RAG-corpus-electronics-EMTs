The ﬂow of power and reactive power is from A to B when V1 > V2 and V1 leads V2. Q is determined mainly
by V1 – V2. The direction of reactive power can be reversed by making V2 > V1. It can thus be seen that if a
scalar voltage difference exists across a largely reactive link, the reactive power ﬂows toward the node of lower
voltage. Looked at from an alternative point of view, if there is a reactive power deﬁcit at a point in an electric
network, this deﬁcit has to be supplied from the rest of the circuit and hence the voltage at that point falls. Of
course,  a  surplus  of  reactive  power  generated  will  cause  a  voltage  rise.  This  can  be  interpreted  as  providing
voltage support by supplying reactive power at that point.
