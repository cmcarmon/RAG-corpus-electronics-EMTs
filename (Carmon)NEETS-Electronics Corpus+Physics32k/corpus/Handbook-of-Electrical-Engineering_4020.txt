The vibrating rod modulates the electric Ô¨Åeld in the cavity. The phase difference between the vibrations and the
modulation  provides  an  indication  of  deviation  from  resonance  and  is  used  to  control  repositioning  of  the
plunger to maintain resonance. (Reprinted with permission from NASA Tech Briefs, 20(10), 54, 1996.)
