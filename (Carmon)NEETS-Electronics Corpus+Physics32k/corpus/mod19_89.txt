Basically, a tourniquet consists of a pad, a band, and a device for tightening the band so that the 
blood vessels will be compressed. There are several different kinds of ready-made tourniquets. A variety 
of materials can be used to improvise tourniquets. Any round, smooth pressure object may be used for the 
pad  a compress, a roller bandage, a stone, a rifle shell  and any long, flat material may be used as the 
band. However, the band must be flat: belts, stockings, flat strips of rubber, or neckerchiefs can be used; 
but rope, wire, string, or very narrow pieces of cloth should not be used because they will cut into the 
flesh. A short stick may be used to twist the band, thus tightening the tourniquet.
