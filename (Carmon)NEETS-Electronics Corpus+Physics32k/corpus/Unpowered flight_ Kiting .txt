An airflow over a tethered object can gain it height up to a maximum determined partly by the length of the tether, and then enable it to maintain height while there is sufficient airflow. Such a tethered flying object is called a kite.
If there is a wind, the tether may be attached to a fixed point, or the motion of an object such as a speedboat can be used to create an airflow or to augment the wind. The mobile object can even be another kite.
