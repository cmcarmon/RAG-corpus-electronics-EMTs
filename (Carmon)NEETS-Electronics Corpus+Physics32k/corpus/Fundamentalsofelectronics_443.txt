Figure 4.13 shows the actual speech production system and Figure 4.14 the model speech production
system. The characteristics of the model depends on whether you are saying a vowel or a consonant. We
concentrate ﬁrst on the vowel production mechanism. When the vocal cords are placed under tension by
the surrounding musculature, air pressure from the lungs causes the vocal cords to vibrate. To visualize this
eﬀect, take a rubber band and hold it in front of your lips. If held open when you blow through it, the air
passes through more or less freely; this situation corresponds to “breathing mode.” If held tautly and close
together, blowing through the opening causes the sides of the rubber band to vibrate. This eﬀect works best
with a wide rubber band. You can imagine what the airﬂow is like on the opposite side of the rubber band
or the vocal cords. Your lung power is the simple source referred to earlier; it can be modeled as a constant
supply of air pressure. The vocal cords respond to this input by vibrating, which means the output of this
system is some periodic function.
