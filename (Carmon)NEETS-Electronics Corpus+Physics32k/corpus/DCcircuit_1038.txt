To ﬁnd the Thevenin series resistance for our equivalent circuit, we need to take the original
circuit (with the load resistor still removed), remove the power sources (in the same style as we
did with the Superposition Theorem: voltage sources replaced with wires and current sources
replaced with breaks), and ﬁgure the resistance from one load terminal to the other:
