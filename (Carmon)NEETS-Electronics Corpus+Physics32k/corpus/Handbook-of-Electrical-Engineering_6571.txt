Still further capacity is possible using optical frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM). In this scheme, many
optical carriers very closely spaced in wavelength (maybe a few tenths of a nanometer) operate as independent
channels. Hundreds of channels can be visualized in each of the two low-loss Ô¨Åber windows. Systems of this
type require coherent detection receivers to separate the closely spaced carriers.
