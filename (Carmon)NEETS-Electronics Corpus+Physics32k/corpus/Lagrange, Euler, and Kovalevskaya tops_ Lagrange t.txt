"Physically, the Lagrange top is a symmetric rigid body spinning about its figure axis whose base point is fixed. A constant vertical gravitational force acts on the center of mass of the top, which lies on its axis."
The Lagrange top is a symmetric top with the center of mass along the symmetry axis at location,
