Note that, in general, all mixing products will be present in
the spectrum of the output current (i.e., the current will
contain components at jmvRF  nvLOj with m and n integers
ranging from zero to inﬁnity. The ﬁrst few mixing products are
typically of primary interest. Using the three-term expansion
of the output current, yields the following:
