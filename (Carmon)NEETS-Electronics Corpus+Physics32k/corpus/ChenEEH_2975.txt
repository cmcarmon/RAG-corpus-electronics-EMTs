Ampliﬁcation is one of the primary functions in an active
microwave circuit. Historically, microwave tubes or diodes in
a negative resistance conﬁguration were used to achieve gain.
Currently, transistors (usually GaAs FETs) are almost univer-
sally used for this purpose. Design of microwave transistor
ampliﬁers takes two speciﬁc paths: small signal ampliﬁers,
such as the low noise ampliﬁers (LNA), use small signal
S-parameters for an adequate design, whereas large signal
ampliﬁers, such as power ampliﬁers, rely on more advanced
