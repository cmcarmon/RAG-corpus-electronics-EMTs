tiveness of impedances, assuming complex exponential sources is actually quite general.
3.14 Designing Transfer Functions25
If the source consists of two (or more) signals, we know from linear system theory that the output voltage
equals the sum of the outputs produced by each signal alone. In short, linear circuits are a special case
