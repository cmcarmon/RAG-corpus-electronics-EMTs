Observing the previous equation, a trivial solution is found for the case dc/dξ = 0, that is when concentration is constant over ξ. This can be interpreted as the rate of advancement of a concentration front being proportional to the square root of time (



x
∝


t




{\displaystyle x\propto {\sqrt {t}}}
), or, equivalently, to the time necessary for a concentration front to arrive at a certain position being proportional to the square of the distance (



t
∝

x

2




{\displaystyle t\propto x^{2}}
); the square term gives the name parabolic law.
