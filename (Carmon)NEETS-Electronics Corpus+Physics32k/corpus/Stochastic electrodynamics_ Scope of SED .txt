SED has been used in attempts to provide a classical explanation for effects previously considered to require quantum mechanics (here restricted to the Schr√∂dinger equation and the Dirac equation and QED) for their explanation. It has also been used to motivate a classical ZPF-based underpinning for gravity and inertia. There is no universal agreement on the successes and failures of SED, either in its congruence with standard theories of quantum mechanics, QED, and gravity, or in its compliance with observation. The following SED-based explanations are relatively uncontroversial and are free of criticism at the time of writing:
The Casimir effect
The Van der Waals force
Diamagnetism
The Unruh effect
The following SED-based calculations and SED-related claims are more controversial and some have been subject to published criticism:
The ground state of the harmonic oscillator
The ground state of the hydrogen atom
De Broglie waves
Inertia
Gravitation
Non-locality and tests of Bell's theorem
