Search Procedures
Searching along the direction of the gradient is ﬁne if the performance surface is quadratic. However, in ANNs
rarely is this the case, because of the use of nonlinear PEs and topologies with several layers. So, gradient descent
can be caught in local minima, which makes the search very slow in regions of small curvature. One efﬁcient
way to speed up the search in regions of small curvature and, at the same time, to stabilize it in narrow valleys
is to include a momentum term in the weight adaptation
