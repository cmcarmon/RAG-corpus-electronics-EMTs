Tracking on Grooved Regions
As shown in Fig. 80.23(a), grooves are continuous depressions that are either embossed or etched or molded
onto the substrate prior to deposition of the storage medium. If the data is recorded on the grooves, then the
lands are not used except for providing a guard band between neighboring grooves. Conversely, the land regions
may be used to record the information, in which case grooves provide the guard band. Typical track widths
are  about  one  wavelength.  The  guard  bands  are  somewhat  narrower  than  the  tracks,  their  exact  shape  and
dimensions depending on the beam size, required track-servo accuracy, and the acceptable levels of cross-talk
between  adjacent  tracks.  The  groove  depth  is  usually  around  one-eighth  of  one  wavelength  (l/8),  since  this
depth  can  be  shown  to  give  the  largest  TES  in  the  push-pull  method.  Cross  sections  of  the  grooves  may  be
rectangular, trapezoidal, triangular, etc.
