In a solid state circuit breaker, thyristors connected back-to-back form
an ac switch module, several of which are, in turn, connected in series to
acquire the required voltage rating. The breaker will interrupt the circuit
at the Ô¨Årst zero of the ac current. This means a delay of a few milliseconds,
which should be acceptable for most applications.
