The procedural paradigm was the earliest programming paradigm. It is the basis of COBOL, FORTRAN,
Pascal, C, BASIC, and most early languages. In this paradigm the world is modeled by an algorithm. Thus, an
electrical circuitâ€™s behavior is modeled as a system of equations. The equations are solved for voltage, current,
and so forth by writing an algorithmic procedure to numerically compute these quantities.
