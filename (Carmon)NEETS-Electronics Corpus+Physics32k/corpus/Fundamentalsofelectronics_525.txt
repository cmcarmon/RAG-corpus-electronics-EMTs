Despite such fundamental diﬀerences, the theory underlying digital signal processing mirrors that for ana-
log signals: Fourier transforms, linear ﬁltering, and linear systems parallel what previous chapters described.
These similarities make it easy to understand the deﬁnitions and why we need them, but the similarities
should not be construed as “analog wannabes.” We will discover that digital signal processing is not an
approximation to analog processing. We must explicitly worry about the ﬁdelity of converting analog signals
into digital ones. The music stored on CDs, the speech sent over digital cellular telephones, and the video
carried by digital television all evidence that analog signals can be accurately converted to digital ones and
back again.
