Power transmission is the movement of energy from its place of generation to a location where it is applied to perform useful work.
Power is defined formally as units of energy per unit time. In SI units:





watt

=


joule
second


=




newton

Ã—

meter


second




{\displaystyle {\text{watt}}={\frac {\text{joule}}{\text{second}}}={\frac {{\text{newton}}\times {\text{meter}}}{\text{second}}}}

Since the development of technology, transmission and storage systems have been of immense interest to technologists and technology users.
