Eddy-current stimulation is very energy inefﬁcient when com-
pared to direct tissue stimulation with electrodes. To improve the
efﬁciency,  investigators  have  sought  strategies  to  concentrate
(focus) the magnetic ﬁeld without the use of ferromagnetic mate-
rial. Ueno et al. [1988] introduced what they called the ﬁgure-of-
eight coil of the type shown in Fig. 113.29 in which the current in the conductors where the two coils touch is
in the same direction, thereby concentrating the ﬁeld. Note that the currents in the two coils are in opposite
directions; hence the magnetic ﬁelds (B1, B2) are in opposite directions. With this coil conﬁguration and current
direction, the induced electric ﬁeld is a maximum over the site where the coils touch, as shown in Fig. 113.28b.
Although  the  use  of  a  pair  of  coils  increases  the  efﬁciency  of  magnetic  stimulation,  it  makes  coil  placement
more critical.
