As additional terms are used to develop a subdomain basis, higher-order continuity can be achieved in the
unknown  that  the  basis  represents,  assuming  still  that  one  unknown  is  reserved  for  the  amplitude  of  the
multiterm  basis  function.  In  the  general  case  of  the ns-term  subdomain  basis,  up  to  ns –  1  constants  can  be
determined  from  continuity  conditions,  with  the  remainder  reserved  for  the  unknown.  The  kind  of  basis
function  employed  ultimately  determines  the  degree  of  ﬁt  that  the  numerical  result  can  provide  to  the  true
behavior of the unknown for a given order of matrix. An important factor that should inﬂuence basis-function
selection, then, is how closely a candidate function might resemble the physical behavior of the unknown it
represents. Another consideration is whether a system of equations that is numerically easier to solve might
result from a particular choice of basis and weight function, for example, by increasing its diagonal dominance
so that an iterative technique will converge more rapidly and/or reduce the number of signiﬁcant interactions.
Various evolving approaches having names such as “impedance-matrix localization.” “fast multipole method,”
“spatial decomposition,” and “multilevel matrix-decomposition” are being developed with these goals.
