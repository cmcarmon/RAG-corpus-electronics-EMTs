After all parts are placed in the solder paste, the entire assembly enters a reﬂow oven to raise the temperature
of  the  assembly  high  enough  to  reﬂow  the  solder  paste  and  create  acceptable  solder  joints  at  the  component
lead/pad transitions. Reﬂow ovens most commonly use convection and IR heat sources to heat the assembly above
(cid:176)
C. Due to the much higher thermal
the point of solder liquidus, which for 63/37 tin-lead eutectic solder is 183
conductivity  of  the  solder  paste  compared  to  the  IC  body,  reﬂow  soldering  temperatures  are  reached  at  the
leads/pads before the IC chip itself reaches damaging temperatures. The board is inverted and the process repeated.
If mixed-technology Type II is being produced, the board will then be inverted, an adhesive will be dispensed
at the centroid of each SMD, parts placed, the adhesive cured, the assembly re-righted, through-hole components
mounted,  and  the  circuit  assembly  will  then  be  wave-soldered  which  will  create  acceptable  solder  joints  for
both the through-hole components and bottom-side SMDs.
