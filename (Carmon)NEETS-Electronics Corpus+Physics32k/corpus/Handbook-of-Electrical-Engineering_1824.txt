Multidimensional signal processing techniques have found wide application in seismology—where a group
of identical seismometers, called seismic arrays, are used for event location, studies of the earth’s sedimentation
structure, and separation of coherent signals from noise, which sometimes may also propagate coherently across
the array but with different horizontal velocities—by employing velocity ﬁltering [Claerbout, 1976]. Velocity
ﬁltering is performed by multidimensional ﬁlters and allows also for the enhancement of signals which may
occupy the same wavenumber range as noise or undesired signals do. In a broader context, beamforming can
be used to separate signals received by sensor arrays based on frequency, wavenumber, and velocity (speed as
well as direction) of propagation. Both the transfer and unit impulse-response functions of a velocity ﬁlter are
two-dimensional functions in the case of one-dimensional arrays. The transfer function involves frequency and
wavenumber  (due  to  spatial  sampling  by  equally  spaced  sensors)  as  independent  variables,  whereas  the  unit
impulse response depends upon time and location within the array. Two-dimensional ﬁltering is not limited
to velocity ﬁltering by means of seismic array. Two-dimensional spatial ﬁlters are frequently used, for example,
in the interpretation of gravity and magnetic maps to differentiate between regional and local features. Input
data for these ﬁlters may be observations in the survey of an area conducted over a planar grid over the earth’s
surface. Two-dimensional wavenumber digital ﬁltering principles are useful for this purpose. Velocity ﬁltering
by means of two-dimensional arrays may be accomplished by properly shaping a three-dimensional response
function  H(k1,k2,w).  Velocity  ﬁltering  by  three-dimensional  arrays  may  be  accomplished  through  a  four-
dimensional function H(k1,k2,k3,w) as explained in the following subsection.
