Similar to Allied and Digi‐Key, Mouser is a stocking distributor with tens of 
thousands of parts on hand. If you can’t find it at Mouser, it probably doesn’t 
exist. Mouser carries more than 165,000 resistors alone, listed in the “Passive 
Components” category. You can order from its online store or its humongous 
print catalog. Feel free to request a printed catalog to keep on your night-
stand, or let your mouse do the walking through Mouser’s online catalog.
