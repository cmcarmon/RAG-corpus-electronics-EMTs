In 1943, he was sent to the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos, New Mexico, working under Robert Oppenheimer to develop the atomic bomb. At Los Alamos, Skaggs was charged with the task of adapting the anti-aircraft detection system into a failsafe "fuse" for the first bomb that would be used against Japan.
From a distance of 20 miles, Skaggs witnessed the first test at Alamogordo, New Mexico. Skaggs immediately understood that the current plans left an unacceptable amount of time for the bombardiers to safely escape from the drop zone. He developed a system with two back-up systems that allowed additional time to for the plane and crew to make a secure exit from the skies over Japan.
