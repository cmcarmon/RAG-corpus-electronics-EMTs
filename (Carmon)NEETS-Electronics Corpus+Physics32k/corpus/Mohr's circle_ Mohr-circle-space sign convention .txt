In the Mohr-circle-space sign convention, normal stresses have the same sign as normal stresses in the physical-space sign convention: positive normal stresses act outward to the plane of action, and negative normal stresses act inward to the plane of action.
Shear stresses, however, have a different convention in the Mohr-circle space compared to the convention in the physical space. In the Mohr-circle-space sign convention, positive shear stresses rotate the material element in the counterclockwise direction, and negative shear stresses rotate the material in the clockwise direction. This way, the shear stress component

{\displaystyle \tau _{xy}}
is positive in the Mohr-circle space, and the shear stress component

{\displaystyle \tau _{yx}}
is negative in the Mohr-circle space.
Two options exist for drawing the Mohr-circle space, which produce a mathematically correct Mohr circle:
Positive shear stresses are plotted upward (Figure 5, sign convention #1)
Positive shear stresses are plotted downward, i.e., the

{\displaystyle \tau _{\mathrm {n} }}
-axis is inverted (Figure 5, sign convention #2).
Plotting positive shear stresses upward makes the angle

on the Mohr circle have a positive rotation clockwise, which is opposite to the physical space convention. That is why some authors prefer plotting positive shear stresses downward, which makes the angle

{\displaystyle 2\theta }
on the Mohr circle have a positive rotation counterclockwise, similar to the physical space convention for shear stresses.
To overcome the "issue" of having the shear stress axis downward in the Mohr-circle space, there is an alternative sign convention where positive shear stresses are assumed to rotate the material element in the clockwise direction and negative shear stresses are assumed to rotate the material element in the counterclockwise direction (Figure 5, option 3). This way, positive shear stresses are plotted upward in the Mohr-circle space and the angle

θ


{\displaystyle 2\theta }
has a positive rotation counterclockwise in the Mohr-circle space. This alternative sign convention produces a circle that is identical to the sign convention #2 in Figure 5 because a positive shear stress

{\displaystyle \tau _{\mathrm {n} }}
is also a counterclockwise shear stress, and both are plotted downward. Also, a negative shear stress

{\displaystyle \tau _{\mathrm {n} }}
is a clockwise shear stress, and both are plotted upward.
This article follows the engineering mechanics sign convention for the physical space and the alternative sign convention for the Mohr-circle space (sign convention #3 in Figure 5)
