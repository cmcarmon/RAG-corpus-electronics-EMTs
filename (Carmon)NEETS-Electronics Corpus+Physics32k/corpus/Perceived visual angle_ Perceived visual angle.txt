The perceived endpoint at B′ has the perceived direction, d′B, and the observer might simply say "it looks straight ahead and toward the horizon."
This concept of the (subjective) visual direction is very old. However, as Wade, Ono & Mapp (2006) noted, it unfortunately has been ignored in many current theories of size perception, and size illusions.
The object's other perceived endpoint, A′, has a perceived direction d′A;, about which the observer might say "it appears toward a higher elevation than point B′." The difference between the two perceived directions (d′A − d′B) is the perceived visual angle θ′, also called the perceived angular size or apparent angular size.
It is not easy to quantify θ′. For instance, a well-trained observer might say that point A′ "looks about 25 degrees higher" than B′, but most cannot reliably say how large a direction difference looks. That skill is not practiced because it is easier to use pointing gestures (Ono, 1970): For example, one often tells another person about the change in the directions seen for two viewed points by pointing something, say a finger or the eyes from one point to the other.
Therefore, in some experiments the observers aimed a pointer from one viewed point to the other, so the angle through which the pointer rotated was the measure of θ′, (Komodo, 1970, Komodo & Ono, 1974, Ono, Muter, & Mitson, 1974, Gogel & Eby, 1997).
Also, because θ′, specifies the amount by which one should rotate one's eye to quickly look from one seen point to another eye tracking, saccade, observers in other experiments shifted their gaze from one object endpoint to the other, and the angle the eye rotated through was measured as θ′ for that object (Yarbus (1967).
