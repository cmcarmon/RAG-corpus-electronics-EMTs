Maps can be presented in any of several projections to assist in interpretation [Zappulla, 1991]. The most
common projection is the top view which presents the spatial distribution of variables from all leads simulta-
neously. Lateral, posterior, and anterior projections highlight focal areas of interest. Although mapping presents
a  method  by  which  spatial  information  can  be  efÔ¨Åciently  communicated,  it  is  important  to  be  alert  to  the
artifacts that can arise from map construction and manipulation. Topographic spatial artifacts that can lead to
misinterpretation include ring enhancement around a spike using source-derivation references, spatial aliasing
arising from linear interpolation which causes maximal activity to be mapped at electrode sites, the enhancement
of  activity  away  from  the  midline,  and  the  attenuation  of  midline  activity  on  amplitude  asymmetry  maps
(centrifugal effect).
