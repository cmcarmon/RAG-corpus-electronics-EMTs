As  we  have  discussed  in  the  previous  sections,  the  1980s  was  an  important  decade  for  control  engineering.
Apart form new theories, better design methods, and more accurate numerical algorithms, this was the decade
when  powerful  and  easy-to-use  interactive  CACSD  tools  were  put  on  the  average  control  engineerâ€™s  desk.
Through the use of interactive and extendible programs, new methods and algorithms could be easily imple-
mented and quickly brought to bear on real control engineering problems. Yet despite this tremendous improve-
ment in the availability of good control design environments, the total cost and cycle time for a complex control
design  was  still  perceived  by  many  groups  and  companies  as  being  too  high.  One  of  the  major  remaining
bottlenecks was the manual conversion of a control design into testable simulation code and, at a later stage,
the conversion of the eventual design into the actual embedded real-time controller code.
