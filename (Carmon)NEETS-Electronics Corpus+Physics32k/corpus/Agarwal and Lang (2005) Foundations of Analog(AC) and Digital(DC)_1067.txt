(cid:1) The SU model provides accurate models of the MOSFET in both the triode
and the saturation regions, but is more complicated. In its saturation region,
it behaves as the SCS model. So, for analog circuits that are designed to
adhere to the saturation discipline its use is no different than the use of
the SCS model. Thus the SU model is useful when the designer wishes
to conduct very accurate analyses of digital or analog circuits in which
the MOSFETs are allowed to operate in both their triode and saturation
regions. To analyze a circuit containing MOSFETs, the designer first makes
an educated guess as to the region
in
which each of the MOSFETs operates. Then, the designer writes node
equations for the circuit, selecting appropriate device equations for each of
the MOSFETs. After solving the set of equations for the node voltages and
edge currents, the designer must confirm that their initial guess as to the
state of the MOSFET is consistent with the final node voltages. We leave a
