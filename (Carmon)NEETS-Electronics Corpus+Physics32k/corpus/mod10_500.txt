source voltage and the action stops (view D). As each capacitor is charged, current in each inductor drops
to zero, effectively reflecting the current with the opposite polarity (view C). Reflected current of
opposite polarity cancels the original current at each point, and the current drops to zero at that point.
When the last capacitor is charged, the current from the source stops flowing (view D).
