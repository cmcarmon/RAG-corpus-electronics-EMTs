Passive and Active Filters
There are formal deﬁnitions of activity and passivity in electronics, but it is sufﬁcient to observe that passive
ﬁlters are built from passive components; resistors, capacitors, and inductors are the commonly encountered
building  blocks  although  distributed  RC  components,  quartz  crystals,  and  surface  acoustic  wave  devices  are
used in ﬁlters working in the high-megahertz regions. 
 also use resistors and capacitors, but the
inductors are replaced by active devices capable of producing power gain. These devices can range from single
transistors to integrated circuit (IC) -controlled sources such as the operational ampliﬁer (op amp), and more
exotic devices, such as the operational transconductance ampliﬁer (OTA), the generalized impedance converter
(GIC), and the frequency-dependent negative resistor (FDNR).
