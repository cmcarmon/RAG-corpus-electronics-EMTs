Recording Action Potentials
Action potentials of single excitable cells are recorded with transmembrane electrodes (micron diameter) only
in research studies. When action potentials are used for diagnostic purposes, extracellular electrodes are used
that are both large and distant from the population of cells which become active and recover. The depolarization
