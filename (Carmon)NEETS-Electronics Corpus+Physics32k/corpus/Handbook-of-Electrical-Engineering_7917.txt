Transfer of data between registers is an important operation in all digital systems and sometimes the data
may be modiÔ¨Åed during the transfer. For example, in an addition routine the contents of one register will be
added to the contents of another, the resulting sum then being returned to one of the two registers. Parallel or
serial addition could be used, but the example shown in Fig. 81.34 is that of a serial adder. The registers could
each be made up of two 74LS295A devices as previously described. The data to be added is transferred to the
two shifting registers, A, B, using parallel loading of data into the registers, carried out prior to the application
of the shift clock pulses shown.
