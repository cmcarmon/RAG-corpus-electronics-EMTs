Microstrip Antenna Arrays
One of the most useful features of microstrip antenna technology is the ease with which array antennas can
be  constructed,  since  the  feed  network  can  be  fabricated  with  microstrip  transmission  lines  and  microstrip
circuit  components  at  the  same  time  as  the  microstrip  radiating  elements.  This  eliminates  the  cumbersome
and expensive coaxial or waveguide feed networks that are necessary for other types of arrays. In fact, microstrip
technology offers such versatility in design that a wide variety of series-fed, corporate-fed, Ô¨Åxed-beam, scanning,
multilayer, and polarization agile microstrip arrays have been demonstrated, many examples of which can be
found in the literature [James and Hall, 1989; Pozar and Schaubert, 1995].
