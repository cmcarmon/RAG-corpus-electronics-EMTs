Let us first compute the static power dissipated in an inverter. The static
power can be determined by removing all capacitive and inductive elements
from the circuit (remember, this means that we replace capacitors with open
circuits and inductors with short circuits). Accordingly, we will assume that
CL = 0 for our static power calculation. When the MOSFET in the inverter is
turned on, a resistive path exists between power and ground. So current flows
through RL and the on resistance of the MOSFET, RON, causing static power
dissipation:
