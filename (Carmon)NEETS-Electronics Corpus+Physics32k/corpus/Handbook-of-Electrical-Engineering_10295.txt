The  satellite-based  communications  systems  have  signiﬁcantly  evolved  over  a  three-decade  period.  In  the
1960s,  satellite  communications  for  commercial  use  became  a  viable  alternative  because  of  the  demand  for
reliable communications (telephony and voice). In the 1970s, technical innovations made larger, more powerful
and more versatile satellites possible. Advanced modulation and multiple-access schemes resulted in smaller,
and better service offerings that were lower cost and higher quality. In the 1980s
less expensive 
very small aperture terminals 
) emerged and the Ku-band frequency spectrum became widely used.
In  the  1990’s  satellites  support  data,  voice,  and  video  communications  applications.  The VSAT  industry  has
given an overall boost to the entire satellite communication industry.
