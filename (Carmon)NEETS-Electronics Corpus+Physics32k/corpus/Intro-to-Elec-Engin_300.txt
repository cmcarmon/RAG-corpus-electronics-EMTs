Analysis of Frequency Response with PSpice and PROBE
PSpice can readily accomplish the circuit analysis as a function of frequency, and PROBE
can display Bode plots for magnitude and phase of network transfer functions. Besides the
linear (LIN) frequency sweep that we used in steady-state sinusoidal analysis, with a sim-
ilar syntax statement, a logarithmic frequency sweep, with points specifying the number of
points per octave (an octave represents a twofold increase in frequency) or per decade (a
decade represents a tenfold increase in frequency), can be speciÔ¨Åed. For example,
the
