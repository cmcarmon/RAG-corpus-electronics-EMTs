At the beginning of this chapter, signals were classiﬁed into
four categories according to the values assumed by the inde-
pendent and the dependent variables. So far, we have focused
our attention only on the independent variable, namely time,
to distinguish signals between continuous-time and discrete-
time signals, and we assumed that the dependent variable can
assume a continuum of values.
