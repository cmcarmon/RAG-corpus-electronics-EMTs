fD and fA represent discrete-time and analog frequency variables, respectively. Figure 5.4 inspires another
way of deriving this result. As the duration of each pulse in the periodic sampling signal pTs (t) narrows, the
amplitudes of the signal’s spectral repetitions, which are governed by the Fourier series coeﬃcients (4.10) of
pTs (t), become increasingly equal. Examination of the periodic pulse signal (Figure 4.1) reveals that as ∆
decreases, the value of c0, the largest Fourier coeﬃcient, decreases to zero: |c0| =
. Thus, to maintain
a mathematically viable Sampling Theorem, the amplitude A must increase as 1
, becoming inﬁnitely large
∆
as the pulse duration decreases. Practical systems use a small value of ∆, say 0.1 · Ts and use ampliﬁers to
rescale the signal. Thus, the sampled signal’s spectrum becomes periodic with period 1
