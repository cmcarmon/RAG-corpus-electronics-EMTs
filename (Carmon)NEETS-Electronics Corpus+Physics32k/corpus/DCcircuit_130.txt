One foundational unit of electrical measurement, often taught in the beginnings of electron-
ics courses but used infrequently afterwards, is the unit of the coulomb, which is a measure of
electric charge proportional to the number of electrons in an imbalanced state. One coulomb of
charge is equal to 6,250,000,000,000,000,000 electrons. The symbol for electric charge quantity
is the capital letter ”Q,” with the unit of coulombs abbreviated by the capital letter ”C.” It so
happens that the unit for electron ﬂow, the amp, is equal to 1 coulomb of electrons passing by
a given point in a circuit in 1 second of time. Cast in these terms, current is the rate of electric
charge motion through a conductor.
