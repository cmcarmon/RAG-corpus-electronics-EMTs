This clumping behavior applies to any small macroscopic object that floats or clings to the surface of a liquid. Examples of such objects are hair particles in shaving cream and fizzy beer bubbles. The effect is not noticeable in boats and other large floating objects because the force of surface tension is relatively small at that scale. (The Casimir effect, with a similar result, occurs at a nanoscopic scale; boats and other large floating objects in a choppy sea are subject to its classical equivalent. Both are caused by waves, not surface tension.)
