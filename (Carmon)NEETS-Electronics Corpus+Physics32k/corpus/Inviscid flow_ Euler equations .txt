In a 1757 publication, Leonhard Euler described a set of equations governing inviscid flow:

{\displaystyle \rho {Dv \over Dt}=-\nabla p+\rho g}

Assuming inviscid flow, or negligible viscosity, allows the use of the Euler equation, and can apply to many examples of flow in which viscous forces are insignificant. Some examples include flow around an airplane wing, upstream flow around bridge supports in a river, and ocean currents.
