In differential convective form, the compressible (and most general) Euler equations can be written shortly with the material derivative notation:

where the additional variables here is:




e


{\displaystyle e}
is the specific internal energy (internal energy per unit mass).
The equations above thus represent conservation of mass, momentum, and energy: the energy equation expressed in the variable internal energy allows to understand the link with the incompressible case, but it is not in the simplest form. Mass density, flow velocity and pressure are the so-called convective variables (or physical variables, or lagrangian variables), while mass density, momentum density and total energy density are the so-called conserved variables (also called eulerian, or mathematical variables). If one explicitates the material derivative the equations above are:
