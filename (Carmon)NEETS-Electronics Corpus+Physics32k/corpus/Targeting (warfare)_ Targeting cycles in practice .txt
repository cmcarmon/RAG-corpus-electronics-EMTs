General Stanley A. McChrystal wrote in 2014 about a targeting cycle called "F3EA" used in the Iraq War, which stands for:
Find: A target (person or location) is first identified and located.
Fix: The target is then kept under continuous surveillance to ensure it hasn't moved.
Finish: A raiding force is assigned to capture or kill the target.
Exploit: Intelligence material is secured and mined, with detainees interrogated.
Analyze: Information is studied to identify further targeting opportunities.
