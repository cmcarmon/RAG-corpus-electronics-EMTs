generic circuit with a binary-tree structure that has been bit-
sliced with added spare components (shown shaded) in this
manner. The last bit slice is composed only of spares. Such a
structure with the appropriate input and output pipelines
will be 1-FD and, with some slight modiﬁcations, would also
be 1-FT.
