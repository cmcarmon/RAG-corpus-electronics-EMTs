A classic molecular solid consists of small, non-polar covalent molecules, and is held together by London dispersion forces (van der Waals forces); a classic example is paraffin wax. These forces are weak, resulting in pairwise interatomic binding energies on the order of 1/100 those of covalent, ionic, and metallic bonds. Binding energies tend to increase with increasing molecular size and polarity (see intermediate forms).
Solids that are composed of small, weakly bound molecules are mechanically weak and have low melting points; an extreme case is solid molecular hydrogen, which melts at 14 K (−259 °C). The non-directional nature of dispersion forces typically allows easy plastic deformation, as planes of molecules can slide over one another without seriously disrupting their attractive interactions. Molecular solids are typically insulators with large band gaps.
