When you are using ammeters, a primary rule of safety is that such current-measuring instruments
must always be connected in series with a circuit, never in parallel with it. When an ammeter is
connected across a constant-potential source of appreciable voltage, the low internal resistance of the
meter bypasses the circuit resistance. This results in the application of the source voltage (or a good
