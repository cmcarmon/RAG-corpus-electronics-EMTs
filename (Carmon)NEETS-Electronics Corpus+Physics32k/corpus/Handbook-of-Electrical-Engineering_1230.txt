Positive-Semideﬁnite Matrices
Positive-semideﬁnite matrices frequently arise in applications related to random and deterministic time series.
For example, if x ˛  C n is a vector whose components are random variables, it is well known that the associated
n ·  n correlation matrix as deﬁned by Rxx =  E{xx*} is positive-semideﬁnite Hermitian, where E designates the
expected value operator. Similarly, orthogonal projection matrices are often used to describe vector subspaces
that identify signals present in empirical data. An orthogonal projection matrix is a positive-semideﬁnite matrix
which has the additional requirements of being idempotent (i.e., A2 = A) and Hermitian (i.e., A* = A). It is
well known that the eigenvalues associated with an orthogonal projection matrix are exclusively equal to zero
and  one.  With  these  examples  serving  as  motivation,  we  shall  now  examine  some  of  the  salient  algebraic
characteristics of positive-semideﬁnite matrices.
