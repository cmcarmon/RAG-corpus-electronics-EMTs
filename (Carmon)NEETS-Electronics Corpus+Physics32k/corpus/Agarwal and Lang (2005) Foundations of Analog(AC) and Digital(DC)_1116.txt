To summarize, the small-signal model is a statement of a particular type
of linearized analysis of our circuits, which applies when the desired circuit
responds to signals that can be represented as an incremental perturbation over
a DC operating value. Put another way, it is a statement of a particular type of
constraint on our use of circuits called the small-signal discipline that allows us
to obtain linear behavior from nonlinear circuits over small ranges of operation.
