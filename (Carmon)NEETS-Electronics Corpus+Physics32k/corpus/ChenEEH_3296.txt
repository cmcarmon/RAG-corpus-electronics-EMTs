2. Multiple power ﬂow solutions can exist for a speciﬁed
loading condition. In Figure 7.10, there exist two solu-
tions for any load P < Pmax. Among the two solutions,
the solution on the upper locus with voltage V near
1 pu is considered the nominal solution. For the solu-
tions on the lower locus, the bus voltage V may be
unacceptably low for normal operation. The lower
voltage solution also requires higher line current to
deliver the speciﬁed load P, and the line current values
can become unacceptably high. In general, for any
speciﬁed loading condition, we would like to locate
the power ﬂow solution that has the most acceptable
values of voltages and currents among the multiple
power ﬂow solutions. In this example of a single gen-
erator delivering power to a single load, there exist two
power ﬂow solutions. In a large power system, there
may exist a very large number of possible power ﬂow
solutions.
