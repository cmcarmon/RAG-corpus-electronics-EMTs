Standard core sizes for multimode step-index fibers are 50 m m and 100 m m. Standard core sizes for
multimode graded-index fibers are 50 m m, 62.5 m m, 85 m m, and 100 m m. Standard core sizes for single
mode fibers are between 8 m m and 10 m m. In most cases, the material used in the preparation of optical
fibers is high-quality glass (SiO2). This glass contains very low amounts of impurities, such as water or
elements other than silica and oxygen. Using high-quality glass produces fibers with low losses. Small
amounts of some elements other than silica and oxygen are added to the glass material to change its index
of refraction. These elements are called material dopants. Silica doped with various materials forms the
refractive index profile of the fiber core and material dopants are discussed in more detail later in this
chapter. Glass is not the only material used in fabrication of optical fibers. Plastics are also used for core
and cladding materials in some applications.
