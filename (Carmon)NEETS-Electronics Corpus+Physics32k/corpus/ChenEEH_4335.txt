The value of the determinant is independent of the choice of
row or column; it makes no difference whatsoever. Determi-
nants of 2  2 matrices are fairly straightforward in that the two
elements along the main diagonal are multiplied together and
then the product of the remaining two elements is subtracted.
An explanation of determinants for matrices larger than
2  2 is best understood ﬁrst with 3  3 matrices to help
grasp the notation, which can then be expanded to n  n
matrices in general. Consider ﬁrst:
