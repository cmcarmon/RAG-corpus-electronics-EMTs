The RC capacitor-input filter is limited to applications in which the load current is small. This type 
of filter is used in power supplies where the load current is constant and voltage regulation is not 
necessary. For example, RC filters are used in high-voltage power supplies for cathode-ray tubes and in 
decoupling networks for multistage amplifiers.
