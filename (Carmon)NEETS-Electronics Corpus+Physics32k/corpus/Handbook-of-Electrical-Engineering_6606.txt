If we were to go to very high bit rates, the physical bus length might no longer be short compared with a
packet, and collisions caused by delays might upset the “perfect scheduling” of packets. Although methods have
been proposed [Acampora and Hluchyj, 1984] for overcoming this limitation, the electronic circuit costs and
electrical reﬂections on the bus may limit the effectiveness of a centralized bus at very high data rates.
