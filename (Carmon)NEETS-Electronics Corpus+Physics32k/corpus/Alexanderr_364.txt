7.7
An op amp circuit containing a storage element will exhibit ﬁrst-order
behavior.  Differentiators  and  integrators  treated  in  Section  6.6  are
examples  of  ﬁrst-order  op  amp  circuits.  Again,  for  practical  reasons,
inductors are hardly ever used in op amp circuits; therefore, the op amp
circuits we consider here are of the RC type.
