Cyclic Redundancy Check
For a cyclic redundancy check, the scheme selects a standard
deﬁned 8 bits, 10 bits, 12 bits, 16 bits, or 32 bits of a constant
check data. A constant check data is normally represented as a
polynomial constant. For example, the polynomial x3 þ x2 þ 1
is the check data bit of 1101. A data message that could be
thousands of bytes is divided by the polynomial constant with
exclusive or bit-by-bit operation. The remainder of the di-
vision is the CRC that is appended at the end of a frame or
block. With the above example, the CRC will be 3 bits long.
The receiving station takes the data it receives and performs
the same computation with the same polynomial constant. If
the computed CRC is equal to the CRC in the received mes-
sage, it is ﬁne; otherwise an error has occurred. The CRC error
detection scheme cannot detect all errors at all times. In the
case of an error pattern being the multiples of the polynomial
constant, the error cannot be detected. Therefore, it is very
important to select a polynomial constant that has low prob-
ability of being generated in a transmission environment.
