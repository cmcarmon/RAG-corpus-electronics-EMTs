. Source routing transparent (SRT): This approach allows
for the interconnection of LANs by a mixture of source
routing and transparent bridging. The route information
indicator (RII) bit in MAC source address determines
which algorithm will be used. If the RII is equal to 0,
then the frame is handled by transparent bridge logic; if it
equals to 1, it is handled by the source routing logic.
