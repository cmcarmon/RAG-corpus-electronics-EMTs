As secondary consequences of increasing dopant-ion density, channel conductance is further reduced due
to the combined effects of increased scattering of electrons from the dopant atoms and increased oxide ﬁelds
that pin carriers in the inversion layer closer to the insulator–semiconductor interface, increasing scattering at
the interface. These effects also reduce driving ability, although for shorter devices they are important only in
the linear region (that is, below saturation), assuming that mobility m is more strongly affected than saturation
velocity usat.
Hot-Electron Effects
Another limit upon how small a MOSFET can be made is a direct result of the larger ﬁelds in small devices.
Let us digress to consider why proportionately larger voltages, and thus larger ﬁelds, are used in smaller devices.
First,  according  to  Eq. (24.45),  tG  is  shortened  if  voltages  are  increased,  at  least  so  long  as  VG/L  &  Fsat
52104 V/cm. If tG is shortened this way, then so are tD and tINT, Eqs. (24.46) and (24.47). Thus, faster response
is gained by increasing voltages into the velocity saturation region. Second, the fabricational control of smaller
devices has not improved proportionately as L has shrunk, so there is a larger percentage variation in device
parameters with smaller devices. Thus, disproportionately larger voltages are needed to ensure that all devices
operate  in  the  circuit,  to  overcome  this  increased  fabricational “noise.”  Thus,  to  increase  speed  and  to  cope
with fabricational variations, ﬁelds go up in smaller devices.
