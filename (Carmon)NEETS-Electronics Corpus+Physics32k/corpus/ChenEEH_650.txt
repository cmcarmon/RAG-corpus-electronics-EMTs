The more redundant an RNS is, the easier it is to identify
and correct errors. A redundant RNS (RRNS) uses a number r
of moduli
that
are necessary for covering the desired dynamic range. All
N þ r moduli must be relatively prime. In an RRNS, a number
X is presented by a total of N nonredundant residue digits
{X2, . . ., XN } plus r redundant residue digits {XNþ1 . . ., XNþr }.
Of the total number of states, MR ¼ Nþr
i¼1 mi is represented by
the RRNS. The M ¼ N
i¼1mi ﬁrst states constitute its ‘‘legitim-
ate range,’’ while any number that lies in the range (M , MR), is
called ‘‘illegitimate.’’
Any single error moves a legitimate number X into an
illegitimate number X0. Once it is veriﬁed that the number
being tested is illegitimate, its digits are discarded one by one,
until a legitimate representation is found. The discarded digit
whose omission results in the legitimate representation is
the erroneous one. A correct digit can then be produced
by extending the base of the reduced RNS that produced
the legitimate representation. The above error-locating-and-
correcting procedure can be implemented in a variety of
ways. Assuming that the mixed radix representations of all
the reduced RNS representations can be efﬁciently generated,
the legitimate one can be easily identiﬁed by checking the
highest order mixed radix digit against zero. If it is zero,
the representation is legitimate.
