Electricity is a study that is frequently explained in terms of opposites. The term that is the opposite
of resistance is CONDUCTANCE. Conductance is the ability of a material to pass electrons. The factors
that affect the magnitude of resistance are exactly the same for conductance, but they affect conductance
in the opposite manner. Therefore, conductance is directly proportional to area, and inversely proportional
to the length of the material. The temperature of the material is definitely a factor, but assuming a
constant temperature, the conductance of a material can be calculated.
