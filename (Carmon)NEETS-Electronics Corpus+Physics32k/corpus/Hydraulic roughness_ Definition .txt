Hydraulic roughness is the measure of the amount of frictional resistance water experiences when passing over land and channel features. One roughness coefficient is Manning's n-value. Manningâ€™s n is used extensively around the world to predict the degree of roughness in channels. Flow velocity is strongly dependent on the resistance to flow. An increase in this n value will cause a decrease in the velocity of water flowing across a surface.
