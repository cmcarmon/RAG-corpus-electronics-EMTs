General  considerations  for  a  robot  installation  include  hazardous,  repetitive,  or  uncomfortable  working
conditions, difﬁcult handling jobs, or multishift operations. High- and medium-volume production typically
has  many  examples  of  repetitive  operations.  It  can  prove  useful  to  investigate  injury  (particularly  muscular)
reports with medical personnel and ergonomics experts to identify potential manual operations that may be
alleviated  with  the  aid  of  robotics  or  automation.  Multishift  operations  associated  with  high  demand  for  a
product  are  likely  candidates  for  robot  applications. As  compared  to  manual  work  that  typically  has  a  high
variable labor cost, a robot substitution would have a high ﬁxed cost which can be distributed over the number
of shifts plus a low variable cost. The overall effect of a robot application would then be to reduce the total
operating cost.
