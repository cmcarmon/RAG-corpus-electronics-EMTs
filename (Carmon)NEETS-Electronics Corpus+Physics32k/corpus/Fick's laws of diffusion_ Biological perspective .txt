The first law gives rise to the following formula:





Flux

P
(

c

)





{\displaystyle {\text{Flux}}={-P(c_{2}-c_{1})}\,\!}

in which,
P is the permeability, an experimentally determined membrane "conductance" for a given gas at a given temperature.
c2 − c1 is the difference in concentration of the gas across the membrane for the direction of flow (from c1 to c2).
Fick's first law is also important in radiation transfer equations. However, in this context it becomes inaccurate when the diffusion constant is low and the radiation becomes limited by the speed of light rather than by the resistance of the material the radiation is flowing through. In this situation, one can use a flux limiter.
The exchange rate of a gas across a fluid membrane can be determined by using this law together with Graham's law.
