Notice  that  the  observation  signal  is  determined  by  the  energy  per  bit  of  the  noisy  received  signal  ri(t)  =
si(t) + n(t). This is why a signiﬁcant drawback of the CSK system — namely that the threshold value of the
decision circuit depends on the noise level — also applies to COOK. This means that using COOK, one can
maximize the distance between the elements of the signal set, but the threshold level required by the decision
