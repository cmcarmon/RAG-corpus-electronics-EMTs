Other methods of validation are decidedly less mathematical. One may wish to vary parameters and ascertain
whether the performance parameter changes in a reasonable manner. For example, small changes in SNR rarely
cause dramatic changes in system performance. When constructing a simulation, each subsystem, such as ﬁlters,
nonlinear ampliﬁers, and noise and data sources, should be thoroughly tested before being included in a larger
simulation. Be aware, however, that correct operation of all the various subsystems that make up a communi-
cation system does not imply that the overall system performs correctly. If one is writing his or her own code,
one must verify that there are no software bugs or fundamental design errors. Even if one purchases a commercial
software package, there is no guarantee that the designer of the software models made the same assumptions
the user will make when using the model. In most cases it will be far easier to test a module before it is inserted
into a simulation than it will be to isolate a problem in a complex piece of code. The ﬁnal check one may wish
to perform is a redundant simulation. There are many methods of simulating a system. One may wish to have
two teams investigate a problem or have a single team implement a simulation using two different techniques
to verify that the results are reasonable.
