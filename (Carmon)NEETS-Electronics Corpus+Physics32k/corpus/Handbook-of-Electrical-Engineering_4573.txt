Modeling Uncertainties
The  process  of  proceeding  from  an  original  physical  problem  to  computed  results  is  one  that  is  subject  to
numerous uncertainties caused by a variety of factors. Perhaps foremost among these factors is the degree of
arbitrariness associated with many of the choices that are made by the code developer and/or modeler in the
course of eventually obtaining numerical results. Whereas the numerical evaluation of classical boundary-value
problems such as scattering from a sphere is numerically robust in the sense that different workers using different
