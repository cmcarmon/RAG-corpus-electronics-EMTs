Now that you have read how the LC choke-input filter functions, it will be discussed with actual 
component values applied. For simplicity, the input frequency at the primary of the transformer will be 
117 volts 60 hertz. Both half-wave and full-wave rectifier circuits will be used to provide the input to the 
filter.
