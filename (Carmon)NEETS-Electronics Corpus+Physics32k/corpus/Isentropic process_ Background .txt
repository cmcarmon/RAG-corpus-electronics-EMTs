The second law of thermodynamics states that,




T
d
S
≥
δ
Q


{\displaystyle TdS\geq \delta Q}

where



δ
Q


{\displaystyle \delta Q}
is the amount of energy the system gains by heating,



T


{\displaystyle T}
is the temperature of the system, and



d
S


{\displaystyle dS}
is the change in entropy. The equal sign refers to a reversible process, which is an imagined idealized theoretical limit, never actually occurring in physical reality. For an isentropic process, which by definition is reversible, there is no transfer of energy as heat because the process is adiabatic. In an irreversible process of transfer of energy as work, entropy is produced within the system; consequently, in order to maintain constant entropy within the system, energy must be removed from the system as heat during the process.
For reversible processes, an isentropic transformation is carried out by thermally "insulating" the system from its surroundings. Temperature is the thermodynamic conjugate variable to entropy, thus the conjugate process would be an isothermal process in which the system is thermally "connected" to a constant-temperature heat bath.
