One problem with this rule is that the source of power may not be known, or easily found
in time to save the victim of shock. If a shock victim’s breathing and heartbeat are paralyzed
by electric current, their survival time is very limited. If the shock current is of sufﬁcient
magnitude, their ﬂesh and internal organs may be quickly roasted by the power the current
dissipates as it runs through their body.
