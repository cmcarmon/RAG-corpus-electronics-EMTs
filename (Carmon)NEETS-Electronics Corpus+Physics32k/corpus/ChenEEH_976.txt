Step 6. The Cholesky factorization L2 of N is calculated as
described by equation 4.82. Simple, yet efﬁcient, algo-
rithms for computing the Cholesky factorization have
long been known and can be found in multiple
sources (Farebrother, 1988; Lawson and Hanson,
1974; Golub and Loan, 1996; Forsythe and Moler,
1967; Cormen et al., 1989). Recall that the matrix N
is guaranteed to be positive-deﬁnite by construction.
Therefore, the real (no complex numbers) Cholesky
decomposition is guaranteed to exist.
