To measure the mds, you must measure the power of a test pulse in which the level is just sufficient 
to produce a visible receiver output. If a radar receiver has the mds level specified in the maintenance 
manual, then the noise figure should also be correct. Therefore, measurement of the mds is a satisfactory 
substitute for a noise-figure determination and is less complicated.
