The VPI together with the virtual channel identiﬁer (VCI) form the routing label (identiﬁer of the connec-
tion).  The VPI  itself  marks  only  the  virtual  path  (VP).  The VP  concept  allows  the  ﬂexible  conﬁguration  of
 network or virtual private network), which can be independent of the
individual subnetworks (e.g., 
underlying transmission network. VP networks are under the control of network management. The bandwidth
of a VP will be allocated according to its requirements. Within the VP network the individual connections are
established and cleared down dynamically (by signaling).
