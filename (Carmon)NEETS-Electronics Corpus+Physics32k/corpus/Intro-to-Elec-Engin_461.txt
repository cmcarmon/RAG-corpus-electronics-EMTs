*5.1.13 In the circuit of Example 5.1.4, what is the smallest
value of RL so that no matter what value vout takes
in the range of 0 to 20 V, the power dissipation in
the ampliﬁer never exceeds 50 mW?
5.1.14 (a) An audio ampliﬁer with Ri = 10 k, Ro = 0,
and ¯A (ω), as shown in Figure 5.1.13(a), is
used in the circuit shown in Figure P5.1.14
with RS = 1 k, RL = 16 , and C =
