There are now many software packages and suites available
for the design and simulation of MEMS devices. In a very
fundamental way, they are more complicated than the software
for design of either solely electronic devices or solely mechan-
ical devices. This is due to the close coupling of both electrical
and mechanical effects in many MEMS. Consider a microcan-
tilever that is pulled down by electrostatic forces. Its simulation
has to take into account both the ﬂow of electrical charge and
mechanical elasticity in an iterative and self-consistent fashion.
Thermal, optical, magnetic, ﬂuidic, and other mechanisms
are also active in some MEMS and have to be handled self-
consistently in the simulation phase.
