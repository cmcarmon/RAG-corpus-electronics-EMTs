Solution:
This  circuit  contains  a  dependent  source,  unlike  the  circuit  in  the
previous example. To ﬁnd 
we set the independent source equal to
zero but leave the dependent source alone. Because of the presence of
the  dependent  source,  however,  we  excite  the  network  with  a  voltage
vo
connected  to  the  terminals  as  indicated  in  Fig.  4.32(a).  We
source 
vo ⫽ 1 V
may  set 
to  ease  calculation,  since  the  circuit  is  linear.  Our
goal  is  to  ﬁnd  the  current 
through  the  terminals,  and  then  obtain
RTh ⫽ 1兾io.
(Alternatively, we may insert a 1-A current source, ﬁnd the
corresponding voltage
