DC-to-AC Converters
The  dc-to-ac  converters  are  generally  called  inverters.  The  ac  supply  is  ﬁrst  converted  to  dc,  which  is  then
converted to a variable-voltage and variable-frequency power supply. This generally consists of a three-phase
bridge connected to the ac power source, a dc link with a ﬁlter, and the three-phase inverter bridge connected
