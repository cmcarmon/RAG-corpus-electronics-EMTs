Greeks and Romans used large stone sundials based on "a partial sphere or scaphe,” the shadow of the tip of the gnomon was the time-telling index. These dials could in theory tell time accurately if carved to a true sphere and correctly calibrated for a given site.

It took a skilled stone worker and a great deal of time and money to create a sundial. So only wealthy citizens could afford this elaborate contraption, and it was often for their villas or as donations for erection in the town forum. There was a need for cheaper dials that ordinary laborer could construct. But even if it were easier to make the question of calibrating the Scaphe still posed a problem.
The problem of projecting the three- dimensional scaphe dial upon a vertical or horizontal plane, was addressed by a number of distinguished nineteenth-century mathematicians, each of whom presumably solved it to his own personal satisfaction. Unfortunately, their publications are so complex, long-winded, and obscure that they were virtually inaccessible to antiquaries and—it would appear from the replication of effort----even to their own (unacknowledged) colleagues. The spherical trigonometry required for the latter endeavor is really quite basic, and the calculations tedious rather than difficult. The availability of computer-generated graphics has, of course, completely altered the situation. A Fortran program was written for the VAX computer at the University of Leicester that enabled vertical or horizontal dials to be plotted for any latitude.
