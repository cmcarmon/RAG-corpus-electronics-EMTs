As described in the previous section, the FRGE lends itself to a systematic construction of nonperturbative approximations to the gravitational beta-functions by projecting the exact RG flow onto subspaces spanned by a suitable ansatz for




Γ

k




{\displaystyle \Gamma _{k}}
. In its simplest form, such an ansatz is given by the Einstein–Hilbert action where Newton's constant




G

k




{\displaystyle G_{k}}
and the cosmological constant




Λ

k




{\displaystyle \Lambda _{k}}
depend on the RG scale



k


{\displaystyle k}
. Let




g

μ
ν




{\displaystyle g_{\mu \nu }}
and







g
¯




μ
ν




{\displaystyle {\bar {g}}_{\mu \nu }}
denote the dynamical and the background metric, respectively. Then




Γ

{\displaystyle \Gamma _{k}}
reads, for arbitrary spacetime dimension

, have been derived for the first time in reference for any value of the spacetime dimensionality, including the cases of



d

4


{\displaystyle 4}
dimensions. In particular, in



d
=
4


{\displaystyle d=4}
dimensions they give rise to the RG flow diagram shown on the left-hand side. The most important result is the existence of a non-Gaussian fixed point suitable for asymptotic safety. It is UV-attractive both in



g


{\displaystyle g}
- and in



λ


{\displaystyle \lambda }
-direction.
This fixed point is related to the one found in



d

ϵ


{\displaystyle d=2+\epsilon }
dimensions by perturbative methods in the sense that it is recovered in the nonperturbative approach presented here by inserting



d
=

ϵ


{\displaystyle d=2+\epsilon }
into the



β


{\displaystyle \beta }
-functions and expanding in powers of



ϵ


{\displaystyle \epsilon }
. Since the



β


{\displaystyle \beta }
-functions were shown to exist and explicitly computed for any real, i.e., not necessarily integer value of



d


{\displaystyle d}
, no analytic continuation is involved here. The fixed point in



d
=
4


{\displaystyle d=4}
dimensions, too, is a direct result of the nonperturbative flow equations, and, in contrast to the earlier attempts, no extrapolation in



ϵ


{\displaystyle \epsilon }
is required.
