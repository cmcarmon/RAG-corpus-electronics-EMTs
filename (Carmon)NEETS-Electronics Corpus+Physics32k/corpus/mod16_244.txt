FREQUENCY METER provides a means of measuring this frequency. The electrical output frequency of
ac power generators can be measured by a vibrating reed, a tuned circuit, or by a crossed-coil, iron-vane
type meter. The vibrating-reed device is the simplest type of frequency meter. It has the advantage of
being rugged enough to be mounted on generator control panels.
