Project	#	5	â€“	The	Bell	Experiment
The	Bell	Experiment	is	a	basic	project	that	produces	a	musical	sound;	the
result	is	a	device	that	may	be	similar	to	a	doorbell.	It	works	according	to
each	of	its	components;	if	the	resistor,	transistor,	and	IC	are	triggered,	the
bunch	sends	a	signal	to	the	speaker,	which	will	then,	create	the
sound.
