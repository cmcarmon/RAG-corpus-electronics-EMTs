In preparation for most ordinary combat military operations, armed forces are given a series of objectives that may include one or more primary targets. During combat operations, additional targets may be present. Provided any action to deal with those targets would not compromise outlined operational objectives, the military personnel may elect to attack additional targets if the opportunity to do so arises. Operational objectives and primary target allocation will generally not be altered to account for a target of opportunity unless that target is reviewed by a commanding officer and receives a higher target value designation; e.g. if identifiers reveal the target to be a designated high-value target.
