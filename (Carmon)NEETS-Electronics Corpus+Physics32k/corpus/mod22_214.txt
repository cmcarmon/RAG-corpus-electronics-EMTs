Each completed raster scan is referred to as a field; two fields make up a frame. The display rate of 
fields and frames determines the amount of flicker in the display that is perceived by the human eye. Each 
field is made up of approximately 525 horizontal lines. The actual number of horizontal lines varies from 
device to device. A frame consists of the interlaced lines of two fields. The horizontal lines of the two 
fields are interlaced to smooth out the display. A display rate of 30 frames per second produces a smooth, 
flicker-free raster and corresponding display on the screen.
