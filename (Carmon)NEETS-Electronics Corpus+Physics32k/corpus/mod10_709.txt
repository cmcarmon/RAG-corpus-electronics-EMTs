RADIATION PATTERN.â€”Figure 4-27 shows an end view of two parallel half-wave antennas (A 
and B) operating in the same phase and located 1/2 wavelength apart. At a point (P) far removed from the 
antennas, the antennas appear as a single point. Energy radiating toward P from antenna A starts out in 
phase with the energy radiating from antenna B in the same direction. Propagation from each antenna 
travels over the same distance to point P, arriving there in phase. The antennas reinforce each other in this 
direction, making a strong signal available at P. Field strength measured at P is greater than it would be if 
the total power supplied to both antennas had been fed to a single dipole. Radiation toward point P1 is 
built up in the same manner.
