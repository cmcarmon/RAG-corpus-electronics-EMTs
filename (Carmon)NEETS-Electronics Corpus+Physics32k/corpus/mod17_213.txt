Figure 2-11 illustrates the transmitted signal for both AM and ssb. Ssb communications has several
advantages. When you eliminate the carrier and one sideband, all of the transmitted power is concentrated
in the other sideband. Also, an ssb signal occupies a smaller portion of the frequency spectrum in
comparison to the AM signal. This gives us two advantages, narrower receiver bandpass and the ability to
place more signals in a small portion of the frequency spectrum.
