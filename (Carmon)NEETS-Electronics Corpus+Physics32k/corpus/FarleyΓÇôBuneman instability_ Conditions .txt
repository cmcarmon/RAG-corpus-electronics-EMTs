To derive the dispersion relation below, we make the following assumptions. First, quasi-neutrality is assumed. This is appropriate if we restrict ourselves to wavelengths longer than the Debye length. Second, the collision frequency between ions and background neutrals is assumed to be much greater than the ion cyclotron frequency, allowing the ions to be treated as unmagnetized. Because the Buneman instability is electrostatic in nature, only electrostatic perturbations are considered.
