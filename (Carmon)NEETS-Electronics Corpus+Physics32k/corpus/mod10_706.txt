The effects of spacing and the advantages of proper spacing can be demonstrated by some practical 
examples. A collinear array consisting of two half-wave elements with 1/4-wavelength spacing between 
centers has a gain of 1.8 dB. If the ends of these same dipoles are separated so that the distance from 
center to center is 3/4 wavelengths and they are driven from the same source, the gain increases to 
approximately 2.9 dB.
