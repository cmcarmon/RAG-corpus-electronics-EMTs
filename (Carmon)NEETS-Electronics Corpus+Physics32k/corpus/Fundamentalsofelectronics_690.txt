(b) What sampling frequency (if any works) can be used to sample the derivative of s (t)?
(c) The signal s (t) has been modulated by an 8 kHz sinusoid having an unknown phase: the resulting
signal is s (t) sin (2πf0t + φ), with f0 = 8 kHz and φ =? Can the modulated signal be sampled so that
the original signal can be recovered from the modulated signal regardless of the phase value φ? If so,
show how and ﬁnd the smallest sampling rate that can be used; if not, show why not.
