Interfacing Between Logic Families
The interconnection of logic chips requires that input and output speciﬁcations be satisﬁed. Figure 79.6 illus-
trates voltage and current requirements. The driving chip’s VOH(min) must be greater than the driven circuit’s
VIH(min), and the driver’s VOL(max) must be less than VIL(max) for the loading circuit. Voltage level shifters must be
