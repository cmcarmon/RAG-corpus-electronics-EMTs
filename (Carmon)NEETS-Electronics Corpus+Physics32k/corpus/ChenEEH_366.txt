where cbi is the band bending in the semiconductor due to the
metal-semiconductor work function difference, and c(x) is the
channel potential with respect to the source. In this regime,
the MESFET channel resembles a voltage, controlled resistor.
The drain current varies linearly with the drain bias. The gate
bias changes the width of the depletion region to modulate the
width and the resistance of the channel. This is the linear
region of operation for a MESFET.
For a long channel MESFET (L  a), the drain current in
