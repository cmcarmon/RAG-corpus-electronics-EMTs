Transmitting electrical power to homes and indus-
try requires the use of transformers. Power stations are 
located next to sources of energy, and electrical power 
must often be transmitted over great distances. The 
wires used to carry the power have resistance, which 
causes power loss during the transmission. The power 
is equal to the current times the voltage:
