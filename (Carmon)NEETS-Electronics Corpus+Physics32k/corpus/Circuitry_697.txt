Conclusions 
 
Comment  on  the  measured  voltages.  Are  these 
what  you  would  have  expected?    Justify  them  by 
calculation  and  state  any  assumptions  made. 
Comment  on  the  waveforms  obtained.  What  was 
the  voltage  gain  of  the  amplifier  at  1  kHz?  What 
output  power  was  produced  in  the  load  with  
200 mV pk-pk input? Suggest a typical application 
for the circuit.
