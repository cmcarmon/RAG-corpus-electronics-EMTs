Motors commonly used in variable-speed drives are induction motors, dc motors, and
synchronous motors. For the control of the motors, various types of converters are needed,
as exempliﬁed in Table 16.1.1. A variable-speed drive can use a single converter or more
than one. All converters have harmonics in their inputs and outputs. Some converters suffer
from a poor power factor, particularly at low output voltages. The main advantages of con-
verters are high efﬁciency, fast response, ﬂexibility of control, easy maintenance, reliability,
low weight and volume, less noise, and long life. The power semiconductor converters have
virtually replaced the conventional power controllers such as mercury-arc rectiﬁers and magnetic
ampliﬁers. Most of the drive speciﬁcations are governed by the load requirements, which in
turn depend on normal running needs, transient operational needs, and needs related to location
and environment. Other speciﬁcations are governed by the available source and its capacity,
as well as other aspects like harmonics, power factor, reactive power, regenerated power, and
peak current.
