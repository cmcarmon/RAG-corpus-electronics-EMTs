MAGNETIC FIELDS.â€”Disks should never be exposed to anything that could be the source of a 
magnetic field. Exposure of a disk to a magnetic field could cause the destruction of some or all of the 
data contained on that disk. Some common sources of magnetic energy are crt's, disk drives, and perhaps 
the most common, the telephone.
