transmission line “impedance” is matched to ﬁnal power ampliﬁer “impedance” for maximum
radio frequency power output. Impedance, the overall opposition to AC and DC current, is very
similar to resistance, and must be equal between source and load for the greatest amount of
power to be transferred to the load. A load impedance that is too high will result in low power
output. A load impedance that is too low will not only result in low power output, but possibly
overheating of the ampliﬁer due to the power dissipated in its internal (Thevenin or Norton)
impedance.
