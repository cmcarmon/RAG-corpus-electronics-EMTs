Differential-Error Method
This  technique  is  also  applicable  to  nonlinear  circuits  in  which  energy  storage  effects  can  be  neglected.  The
method is valuable for circuits that have small distortion levels and relies on one’s ability to calculate the small-
signal  gain  of  the  nonlinear  function  at  the  quiescent  operating  point  and  at  the  maximum  and  minimum
excursions of the input signal. Again the power-series expansion provides the basis for developing this technique.
The small-signal gain1 at the quiescent state (x = 0) is a1. At the extreme values of the input signal X1 (positive
peak)  and  –X1  (negative  peak)  let  the  small-signal  gains  be  a+  and  a –,  respectively.  By  deﬁning  two  new
parameters, the differential errors,  E+ and  E –, as
