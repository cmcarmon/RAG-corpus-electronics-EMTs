TETRODES were developed to compensate for the effects of interelectrode capacitance. Placing a
positively charged screen grid between the control grid and plate has the effect of adding a capacitor in
series with the capacitance that exists between the control grid and plate. This reduces total capacitance
below the value of either capacitor as shown by applying the formula:
