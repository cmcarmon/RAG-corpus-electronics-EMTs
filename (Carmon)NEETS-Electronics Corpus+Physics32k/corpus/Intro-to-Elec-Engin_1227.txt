13.1.5 Induction motors are often braked rapidly by
a technique known as plugging, which is the
reversal of the phase sequence of the voltage
supplying the motor. Assume that a motor with
four poles is operating at 1750 r/min from an
inÔ¨Ånite bus (a load-independent voltage supply)
at 60 Hz. Two of the stator supply leads are
suddenly interchanged.
