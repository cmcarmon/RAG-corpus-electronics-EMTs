FREQUENCY CONVERSION.â€”Frequency conversion is accomplished by using the heterodyne
principle of beating two frequencies together to get an intermediate frequency. So far, you have only
become familiar with single conversion; however, some receivers use double or triple conversion. These
methods are sometimes referred to as double or triple heterodyning. Receivers using double or triple
conversion are very selective and suppress IMAGE SIGNALS to yield sharp signal discrimination.
(Image signals are undesired, modulated carrier signals that differ by twice the intermediate frequency
from the frequency to which the superheterodyne receiver is tuned.) Double and triple conversion
receivers also have better adjacent channel selectivity than can be realized in single conversion sets.
