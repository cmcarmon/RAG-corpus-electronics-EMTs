G. VeriÔ¨Åcation/Simulation of Performance: Following placement and routing, the detailed layout of the circuit
blocks and interconnections has been established and more accurate simulations of signal timing and
circuit  behavior  can  be  performed,  verifying  that  the  circuit  behaves  as  desired  with  the  interblock
interconnections in place.
