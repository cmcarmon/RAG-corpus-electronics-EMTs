Surplus just means that the original maker or buyer of the goods doesn’t need 
it any more. It’s simply excess stock for resale. In the case of electronics,   
surplus seldom means used, as it might for other surplus components, such 
as motors or mechanical devices that have been reconditioned. Except for 
hard‐to‐find components — such as older amateur radio gear — surplus 
electronics are typically brand-new, and someone still actively manufactures 
much of this equipment. In this case, surplus simply means extra.
