This chapter puts more emphasis on DSP algorithm to hard-
ware synthesis and its hardware implementation. First, a DSP
algorithm can be expressed as an n-level nested Do-loop, a
recurrent equation, and a data ï¬‚ow graph (DFG). Next, one of
these representations gets synthesized to its hardware counter-
part. The hardware architecture is not only driven by the
algorithm representation but also the sampling rate of input/
output signals. Due to limited hardware resources, operations
and data of a particular algorithm can be scheduled at the right
time and assigned at the right execution unit basis provided
that the precedence and semantics are preserved. For a high-
throughput application such as image/video processing, syn-
thesis of a regular network of processing elements (PEs) is
discussed in detail. Eventually,
implementation technology
and tools of a particular architecture are surveyed.
