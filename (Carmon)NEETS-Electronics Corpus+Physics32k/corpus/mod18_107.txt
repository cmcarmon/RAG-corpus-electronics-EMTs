The antenna system routes the pulse from the transmitter, radiates it in a directional beam, picks up
the returning echo, and passes it to the receiver with a minimum of loss. The antenna system includes the
antenna, transmission lines and waveguide from the transmitter to the antenna, and the transmission line
and waveguide from the antenna to the receiver. In some publications the duplexer is included as a
component of the antenna system.
