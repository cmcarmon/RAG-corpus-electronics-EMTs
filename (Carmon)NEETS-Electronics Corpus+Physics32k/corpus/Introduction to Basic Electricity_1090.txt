When storing power tools, do not wrap the power 
cord around the power tool. Wrapping can damage the 
power cord where it enters the power tool. Extension 
cords should never be wound around an arm to store 
them as it provides an opportunity for the individual 
wires within the power cord to twist. A better solution 
is shown in Figure 8-4. This method can prevent strain 
on the wires in the power cord.
