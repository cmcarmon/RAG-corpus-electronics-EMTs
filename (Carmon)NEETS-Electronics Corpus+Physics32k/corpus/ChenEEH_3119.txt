In its most common conﬁguration, the synchronous ma-
chine stator has a three-phase winding in a laminated core. In
this sense, the stator is the same as the stator in the three-phase
induction motor. The rotor of the synchronous machine has a
dc winding (the ﬁeld) or permanent magnets. In steady-state,
the rotor is moving at synchronous speed so an observer on the
rotor will see a constant ﬁeld. For this reason, the rotor may or
may not be laminated. For high-speed machines, the rotor is
