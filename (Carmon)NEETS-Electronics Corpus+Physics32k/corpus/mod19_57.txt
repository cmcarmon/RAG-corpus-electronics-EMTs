MOUTH-TO-MOUTH.Â—To perform this method of ventilation, clear the victim's mouth of 
obstructions (false teeth and foreign matter), place one hand under the victim's neck and the heel of the 
other hand on the forehead, and, using the thumb and index finger, pinch the nostrils shut. Tilt the head 
back to open the airway. Take a deep breath, cover the victim's mouth with your own, and blow into the 
victim's mouth. Then remove your mouth from the victim's to allow the victim to exhale. Observe the 
victim's chest for movement. If the victim has not started to breathe normally, start artificial ventilation 
with four quick ventilation in succession, allowing the lungs to only partially inflate. If the victim still 
does not respond, then you must fully inflate the victim's lungs at the rate of 12 TO 15 VENTILATIONS 
PER MINUTE, or ONE BREATH EVERY 5 SECONDS.
