As the bubble ring rises, a lift force pointing downward that is generated by the vorticity, acts on the bubble in order to counteract the buoyancy force. This reduces the bubble's velocity and increases its diameter. The ring becomes thinner, despite the total volume inside the bubble increasing as the external water pressure decreases. Bubble rings fragment into rings of spherical bubbles when the ring becomes thinner than a few millimetres. This is due to Plateau-Rayleigh instability. When the bubble reaches a certain thickness, surface tension effects distort the bubble's surface pulling it apart into separate bubbles. Circulation of the fluid around the bubble helps to stabilize the bubble for a longer duration, counteracting the effects of Plateau-Rayleigh instability. Below is the equation for Plateau-Rayleigh instability with circulation as a stabilizing term:

. When



ω


{\displaystyle \omega }
is positive, the bubble is stable due to circulation and when



ω


{\displaystyle \omega }
is negative, surface tension effects destabilize it and break it up. Circulation also has an effect on the velocity and radial expansion of the bubble. Circulation increases the velocity while reducing the rate of radial expansion. Radial expansion however is what diffuses energy by stretching the vortex. Instability happens more quickly in turbulent water, but in calm water, divers can achieve an external diameter of a meter or more before the bubble fragments.
