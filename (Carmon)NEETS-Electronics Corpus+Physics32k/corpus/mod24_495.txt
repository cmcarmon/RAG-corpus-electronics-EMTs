The test method for measuring the bandwidth of multimode fibers in the frequency domain is
EIA/TIA-455-30. Signals of varying frequencies (f) are launched into the test fiber and the power exiting
the fiber at the launched fundamental frequency measured. This optical output power is denoted as Pout(f).
The test fiber is then cut back or replaced with a short length of fiber of the same type. Signals of the
same frequency are launched into the cut-back fiber and the power exiting the cut-back fiber at the
launched fundamental frequency measured. The optical power exiting the cutback or replacement fiber is
denoted as Pin (f). The magnitude of the optical fiber frequency response is
