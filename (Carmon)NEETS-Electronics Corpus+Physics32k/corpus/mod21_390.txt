The second method is used where the value of A Ã— B becomes progressively smaller. The A reading 
is obtained as in the previous example (for the sake of easier computation, suppose that the A reading is 
still 4,000 rpm). Then obtain another submultiple reading for B, keeping in mind the number of times a 
stationary single image was observed. If a stationary single image was observed seven different times and 
the final B reading was 2,000 rpm, the calculation would become as follows:
