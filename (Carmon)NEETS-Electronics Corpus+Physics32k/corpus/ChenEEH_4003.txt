Viterbi Algorithm
The convolutional coding has been one of the most widely used
error corrections in digital wireless communication. Therefore,
the Viterbi decoding algorithm must be implemented efÔ¨Å-
ciently in a pipelined/systolic fashion. A (K, R) convolutional
coding scheme can be described by an FSM, where K is the
constraint length and R is the code rate. Similar to a mealy FSM,
there are a total of 2K coding states where output bits and the
next state depend on the current state and an input bit.
