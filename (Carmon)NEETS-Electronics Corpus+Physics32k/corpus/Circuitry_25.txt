Conductors and insulators 
 
Electric  current  is  the  name  given  to  the  flow  of 
electrons  (or  negative  charge  carriers).  Electrons 
orbit around the nucleus of atoms just as the earth 
orbits  around  the  sun  (see  Fig.  1.3).  Electrons  are 
held  in  one  or  more  shells,  constrained  to  their 
orbital  paths  by  virtue  of  a  force  of  attraction 
towards  the  nucleus  which  contains  an  equal 
number of protons (positive charge carriers). Since 
like  charges  repel  and  unlike  charges  attract, 
negatively  charged  electrons  are  attracted  to  the 
positively charged nucleus. A similar principle can 
be  demonstrated  by  observing 
the  attraction 
between  two  permanent  magnets;  the  two  North 
poles of the magnets will repel each other, while a 
North and South pole will attract. In the same way, 
the unlike charges of the negative electron and the
