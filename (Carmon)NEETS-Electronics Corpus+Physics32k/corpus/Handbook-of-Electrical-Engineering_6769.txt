The term intelligent network refers to the concept of deploying centralized databases in the telecommunications
network and querying those databases to provide a wide variety of network services such as 800 Service (toll-
free service) and credit card calling. The ﬁrst use of these centralized databases was in AT&T’s network in 1981
where they were used to facilitate the setup of telephone calls charged to a Calling Card. Today such databases are
widely deployed throughout North America and support the handling of close to 100 billion telephone calls per year.
The  words  intelligent  network,  when  ﬁrst  used,  had  a  relatively  narrow  deﬁnition,  but  that  deﬁnition  has
broadened  considerably  with  the  introduction  of  the  advanced  intelligent  network,  the  wireless  intelligent
network,  and  soon,  the  broadband  intelligent  network.  The  advanced  intelligent  network  has  introduced
powerful service creation tools which have empowered network providers to create their own network services.
The network providers, in turn, are beginning to broaden the participation in service creation by allowing their
customers  or  third  parties  to  use  these  tools  to  create  services.  The  result  has  been  a  rapid  growth  in  new
network services.
