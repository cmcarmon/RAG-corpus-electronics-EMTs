to phase noise and frequency offset, thus allowing the use of lower-cost LNBs in the VSAT terminals. However,
as compared to BPSK, convolutionally encoded DPSK requires about 2 dB greater Eb/No at a BER of 10
. In
addition, if operation is required below 10 dB, some form of low-level interleaving may be required.
