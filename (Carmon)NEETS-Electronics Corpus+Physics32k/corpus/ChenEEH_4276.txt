CDMA is commonly explained by the ‘‘cocktail party
image,’’ where groups of people of different languages can
communicate simultaneously, despite the surrounding noise.
For a group of people speaking the same language, the rest of

and knows different languages, he or she will be able, playing
the tape several times, to extract the various conversations
taking place in the various languages. With sufﬁcient process-
ing capacity, all conversations can be extracted simultaneously.
separate communication channels by
means of a pesudo-random modulation that is applied and
removed in the digital domain (with these famous codes), not
on the basis of frequency. Multiple users occupy the same
frequency band.
