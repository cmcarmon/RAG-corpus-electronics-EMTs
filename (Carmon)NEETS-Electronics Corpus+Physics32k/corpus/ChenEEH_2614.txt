Basically, there are four types of ferrites isolators: terminated
circulators, Faraday rotation isolators, resonance isolators,
and ﬁeld displacement isolators. They may be designed with
different transmission line media, such as waveguide or micro-
strip. Important design speciﬁcations are forward and reverse
insertion loss, frequency bandwidth, and power handling cap-
ability. The ratio of reverse (isolation) to forward insertion loss
may also be used and is called the ﬁgure of merit.
