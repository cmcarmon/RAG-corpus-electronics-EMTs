Dean was granted two U.S. patents on mechanical devices presumably related to his Dean drive claims. His first patent for a "System for converting rotary motion into unidirectional motion" was granted on May 9, 1959. Another patent for a "Variable oscillator system" was granted on May 11, 1965. These two patent designs were the only ones where Dean revealed the design details with an explanation for operation. However, the details were incomplete, and it is not possible to build a Dean Drive just from the explanations in the patent. Dean's patents, as well as patents for many other similar devices, have been analyzed and it has been determined that none can produce net directional thrust in free space or violate Newton's Third Law. Dean also demonstrated other mechanical devices that were clearly different from his patent designs but apparently never sought patents for them nor otherwise revealed their design details or theory of operation.
In 1978 physicist Russell Adams wrote an article in Analog. Searching in the US patent office he had found at least 50 patents of similar reactionless drives. After studying the mechanisms, he concluded that they all relied in friction against the floor they were placed on, and they would be useless in space, where there isn't friction against any surface.
Dean's patented devices, and his explanation of how his Drive was supposed to work, were later shown to develop no net weight loss over time and do not violate Newton's third law of motion. Many other inventors claim to have invented similar devices, and they all still remain unproven, and lacking a solid theoretic basis.
