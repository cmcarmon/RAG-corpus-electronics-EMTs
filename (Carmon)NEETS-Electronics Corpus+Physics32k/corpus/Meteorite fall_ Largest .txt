While most confirmed falls involve masses between less than one kg to several kg, some reach 100 kg or more. A few are even more than one metric ton. The six largest falls are listed below and five (except the 2013 Chelyabinsk meteorite) occurred during the 20th century. Presumably, events of such magnitude may happen a few times per century but, especially if it occurred in remote areas, may have gone unreported.
For comparison, the largest finds are the 60-ton Hoba meteorite, a 37-ton fragment (El Chaco) and a 30.8-ton fragment (Gancedo) of the Campo del Cielo, and a 30.9-ton fragment (Ahnighito) of the Cape York meteorite.
