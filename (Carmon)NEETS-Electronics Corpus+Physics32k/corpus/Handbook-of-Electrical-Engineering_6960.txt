For example, if CYY(t) ﬁ 0 as t ﬁ ‘, then Eq. (73.64) will hold, and thus Eq. (73.63) will also, where CYY(t)
is the covariance function of Y(t). As long as the two sets of rv’s {X(t + t1), . . ., X(t + tn)} and {X(t + t1 + t), . . .,
X(t + tn + t)} become independent of each other as t ﬁ ‘, the above condition holds, so Eq. (73.63) holds
