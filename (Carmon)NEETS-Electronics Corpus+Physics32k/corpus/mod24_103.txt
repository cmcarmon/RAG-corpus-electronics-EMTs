When light is reflected from a mirror, the angle of reflection equals the angle of incidence. When
light is reflected from a piece of plain white paper; however, the reflected beam is scattered, or diffused,
as shown in figure 2-6. Because the surface of the paper is not smooth, the reflected light is broken up
into many light beams that are reflected in all directions.
