Like  capacitors,  commercially  available  inductors  come  in  differ-
ent values and types. Typical practical inductors have inductance values
ranging  from  a  few  microhenrys  (
),  as  in  communication  systems,
to  tens  of  henrys  (H)  as  in  power  systems.  Inductors  may  be  Ô¨Åxed  or
variable. The core may be made of iron, steel, plastic, or air. The terms
coil and  choke are  also  used  for  inductors.  Common  inductors  are
shown  in  Fig.  6.22.  The  circuit  symbols  for  inductors  are  shown  in
Fig. 6.23, following the passive sign convention.
