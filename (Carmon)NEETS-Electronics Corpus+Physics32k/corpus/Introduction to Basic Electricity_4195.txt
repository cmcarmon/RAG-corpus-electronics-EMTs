Powers of 2:
Counting in binary starts with the numbers 0 and 1.  
When each digit has been used in the 1’s place, 
 another digit is added in the 2’s place and the count 
continues with 10 and 11. This uses up all combina-
tions of two digits, so a third digit is added in the 4’s 
place and the count continues with 100, 101, 110, and 
111. Now a fourth digit is needed in the 8’s place to 
continue, and so on. Figure 41-1 shows the binary 
counting sequence.
