Digital Data and Analog Signal
One example of this combination is that a PC or terminal
connects to a remote host via a telephone network with a
voice-grade modem. The modem modulates digital data to
the characteristics of an analog carrier signal. These character-
istics are the frequency, amplitude, and phase of the carrier
signal. The modem uses one or any combination of the
following three basic techniques as shown in Figure 5.1.
