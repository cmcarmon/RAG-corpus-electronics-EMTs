upper right panel, the excitation is at the resonant frequency of
the ﬁrst-order radial whispering-gallery mode of the micro-
disk, 189.2 THz (l ¼ 1:585 mm). Here, there is a large ﬁeld
enhancement in the microdisk, and 99.79% of the incident
power switches to the upper waveguide in the reverse (left-
ward) direction. This yields the action of a passive, wave-
length-selective switch.
