▶✓ Tuning in (or out) frequencies: Capacitors are often used to help select 
or reject certain electrical signals — which are time‐varying electric cur-
rents that carry encoded information — depending on their frequency.
For instance, a tuning circuit in a radio‐receiver system relies on capaci-
tors and other components to allow the signal from just one radio 
station at a time to pass through to the amplifier stage, while blocking 
signals from all other radio stations. Each radio station is assigned a 
specific broadcast frequency, and it’s the radio builder’s job to design 
circuits that tune in target frequencies. Because capacitors behave dif-
ferently for different signal frequencies, they are a key component of 
these tuning circuits. The net effect is a kind of electronic filtering.
