Measurements and calculations 
 
Plot graphs of voltage (on the vertical axis) against 
time (on the horizontal axis) using the graph layout 
shown in Fig. 3.42. 
  Calculate the time constant for each combination 
of  resistance  and  capacitance  that  you  used  in  the 
investigation. 
 
Conclusion 
 
Comment on the shape of the graphs. Is this  what 
you  would  expect?  For  each  combination  of 
resistance  and  capacitance  estimate 
time 
constant  from  the  graph.  Compare  these  values 
with the calculated values. If they are not the same 
suggest possible reasons for the difference.
