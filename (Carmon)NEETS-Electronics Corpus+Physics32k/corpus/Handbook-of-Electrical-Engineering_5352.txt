A  major  cost  factor  for  the  Si  solar  cell  is  that  associated  with  a  high-perfection  wafer.  This  has  directed
attention toward less energy-intensive process, which sacriﬁce the crystalline order and higher device efﬁciency
for the beneﬁts of lower energy production and perhaps the utilization of lower purity feedstock Si. Casting (and
some sister technologies) has become conventional in the current Si manufacturing industry. Bulk and ribbon
approaches for sheet-Si material have undergone extensive investigations and development over the past 20 years.
Among the more developed technologies is the Edge Film-Fed Growth (EFG) process, which involves the shaping
of Si through a special die and forming a connected octagon of ﬂat sheets. The cells are cut from the connected
structure by lasers, and large area solar cells (100 cm2) with efﬁciencies exceeding 14% have been produced.
