There are many reasons among which some are crucial. Although the 8-bit solution has almost reached its
top performance, that does not mean that it’ll vanish overnight. As in the world of cars, there are fans of Rolls
Royce,  Cadillac,  and  Geo  Metro  which  exactly  reﬂect  the  future  of  8-bit  cards.  Many  existing  and  incoming
applications will still be satisﬁed by an 8-bit solution, offering to card issuers and clients something fulﬁlling
their needs and at the same time remaining affordable. The second crucial reason is 32-bit technology maturity
being on its learning curve. In certain, software developers as well as chip manufacturers will reach the level
of expertise high enough to push prices from the “Cadillac” level to the “Geo Metro” level. The 8-bit card shall
survive  even  if  in  the “bicycle”  position.  The  market  continuously  creates  a  third  important  factor:  multi-
application requirement. Today most of us have his/her wallet ﬁlled up with dozens of credit and/or debit cards,
ID cards, healthcare cards, loyalty program cards, etc. Card issuers try to attract their customers by a vision of
merged functionalities installed on one card, requiring a need for more sophisticated technology. The perception
today of such a solution directs issuers’ as well as card manufacturers’ interest toward 32-bit technology. There
is  still  a  future  for  now  since  there  are  few  32-bit  chip  manufacturers  known:  NEC,  Philips,  Siemens,  and
Hitachi, however, the rest of world’s biggest players are close to launching their modern products.
