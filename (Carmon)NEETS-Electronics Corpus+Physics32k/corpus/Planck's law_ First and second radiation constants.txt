In the above variants of Planck’s law, the Wavelength and Wavenumber variants use the terms 2hc2 and hc/kB which comprise physical constants only. Consequently, these terms can be considered as physical constants themselves, and are therefore referred to as the first radiation constant c1L and the second radiation constant c2 with
c1L = 2hc2
and
c2 = hc/kB.
Using the radiation constants, the Wavelength variant of Planck’s law can be simplified to

{\displaystyle L(\lambda ,T)={\frac {c_{1L}}{\lambda ^{5}}}{\frac {1}{\exp \left({\frac {c_{2}}{\lambda T}}\right)-1}}}

and the wavenumber variant can be simplified correspondingly.
L is used here instead of B because it is the SI symbol for spectral radiance. The L in c1L refers to that. This reference is necessary because Planck's law can be reformulated to give spectral radiant exitance M(λ,T) rather than spectral radiance L(λ,T), in which case c1 replaces c1L, with
c1 = 2πhc2,
so that Planck’s law for spectral radiant exitance can be written as
