frequency  range  that  is  of  practical  use  (below  
for  narrow-band 
30  kHz) 
communication.  At 
signals 
propagate  as  ground  waves 
the 
curvature of the earth) over very long distances. At 
the other extreme, the highest frequency range that 
is of practical importance extends above 30GHz. At 
these  microwave 
considerable 
bandwidths  are  available  (sufficient  to  transmit 
many television channels using point-to-point links 
or to permit very high definition radar systems) and 
signals tend to propagate strictly along line-of-sight 
paths. 
  At  other  frequencies  signals  may  propagate  by 
various  means  including  reflection  from  ionized 
layers  in  the  ionosphere.  At  frequencies  between  
3 MHz  and  30  MHz  ionospheric  propagation 
regularly permits intercontinental broadcasting and 
communications. 
  For convenience, the radio frequency spectrum is 
divided  into  a  number  of  bands,  each  spanning  a 
decade  of  frequency.  The  use  to  which  each 
frequency  range  is  put  depends  upon  a  number  of 
factors,  paramount 
the 
propagation 
the  band 
concerned. Other factors that need to be taken into 
account  include  the  efficiency  of  practical  aerial 
systems in the range concerned and the bandwidth 
available.  It  is  also  worth  noting  that,  although  it 
may appear from Fig. 13.1 that a great deal of the 
radio frequency spectrum is not used, it should be 
stressed  that  competition  for  frequency  space  is 
fierce. Frequency allocations are, therefore, ratified 
by  international  agreement  and  the  various  user 
services carefully safeguard their own areas of the 
spectrum.
