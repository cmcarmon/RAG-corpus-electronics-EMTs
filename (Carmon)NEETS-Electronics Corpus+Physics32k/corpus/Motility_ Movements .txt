The events that are perceived as movements can be directed:
along a chemical gradient (see chemotaxis)
along a temperature gradient (see thermotaxis)
along a light gradient (see phototaxis)
along a magnetic field line (see magnetotaxis)
along an electric field (see galvanotaxis)
along the direction of the gravitational force (see gravitaxis)
along a rigidity gradient (see durotaxis)
along a gradient of cell adhesion sites (see haptotaxis)
along other cells or biopolymers
