Figure 2.64 shows a circuit containing our dependent source. For clarity,
the dependent source device is shown within the dashed box. In the figure, an
independent voltage source (sourcing a voltage V) is connected to the control
port and a resistor is connected to the output port. For the connection shown,
because
