All-Optical Devices
To create an all-optical logic device requires a medium that will allow one beam of light to affect another. This
phenomenon can arise from the cubic response to the applied Ô¨Åeld. These third-order processes can lead to
purely  dielectric  phenomena,  such  as  irradiance-dependent  refractive  indices.  By  exploiting  purely  dielectric
third-order nonlinearities, such as the optical Kerr effect, changes can be induced in the optical constants of
the medium which can be read out directly at the same wavelength as that inducing them. This then opens up
