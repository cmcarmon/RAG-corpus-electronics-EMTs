The other half of the input cycle is shown in view B. C2 is charged to twice the input voltage, or 400 
volts, as a result of the voltage-doubling action of the transformer and C1. At this time, C2 and C3 are 
used as series-aiding devices, and the output voltage increases to the sum of their respective voltages, or 
600 volts. R1 and R2 are proportional according to the voltages across C2 and C3. In this case, there is a 
2 to 1 ratio.
