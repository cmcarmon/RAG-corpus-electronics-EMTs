A low-velocity electron beam is raster scanned across the target to neutralize the charge. The surplus electrons
return  to  the  electron  multiplier  and  generate  a  current  for  the  signal  output.  The  output  current  is  thus
inversely proportional to the light level at the scanning position of the beam. The orthicon tube is very sensitive
because there is both charge accumulation between scans and gain from the electron multiplier.
