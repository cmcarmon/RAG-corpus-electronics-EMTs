It is often necessary to make rapid measurements of low resistances, such as samples of wire or low 
values of meter shunt resistors. A frequently used instrument that is capable of good precision is the 
Kelvin bridge, shown in figure 3-1. Note the similarity between this and the Wheatstone bridge. Two 
additional resistances, R1 and R2, are connected in series and shunted across resistance R, which is the 
circuit resistance existing between the standard and unknown resistances, RS and R X, respectively. In 
performing the adjustment for balance, you must make the ratio of R1 to R2 equal to the ratio of RA to R 
B. When this is done, the unknown resistance can be computed in the same manner as that for the 
Wheatstone bridge, because resistance R is effectively eliminated.
