The reactance appears to be at stator frequency, while the
resistance is divided by the slip. The two circuits may now be
connected together. The rotor quantities have been reﬂected to
the stator by both the turns ratio and the frequency. All current
and voltage is at applied (stator) frequency. Now drop the
primed notation and assume all quantities are referred to
the stator. The signiﬁcance of dividing the rotor resistance
by the slip can be seen by considering an alternative form of
the circuit shown in Figure 4.17(B). The real power crossing
the air gap is:
