is often placed in parallel with another capacitor so that the equivalent
capacitance can be varied slightly. The capacitance of the variable air
capacitor (meshed plates) is varied by turning the shaft. Variable capac-
itors  are  used  in  radio  receivers  allowing  one  to  tune  to  various  sta-
tions. In addition, capacitors are used to block dc, pass ac, shift phase,
store energy, start motors, and suppress noise.
