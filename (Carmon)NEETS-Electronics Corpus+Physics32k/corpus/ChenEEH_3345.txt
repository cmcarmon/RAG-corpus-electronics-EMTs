where Ppre
solved by setting the derivatives to zero in equation 7.77. Let
us denote the stable equilibrium by (upre
is the
equilibrium solution of the rotor angle between 0 and p=2.
Next, let us say that the fault occurs at time t ¼ 0. When the
solid fault is present at the middle of the lower transmission
line, the system in Figure 7.14 changes to the conﬁguration
shown in Figure 7.17.
