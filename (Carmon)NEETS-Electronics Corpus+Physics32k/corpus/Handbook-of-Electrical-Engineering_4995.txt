The  breakdown  process  in  gases  is  relatively  well  understood  and  is  explained  in  terms  of  the  avalanche
theory.  A  free  electron,  occurring  in  a  gas  due  to  cosmic  radiation,  will  be  accelerated  in  a  ﬁeld  and  upon
collision with neutral molecules in its trajectory will eject, if its energy is sufﬁcient, other electrons that will in
turn  undergo  additional  collisions  resulting  in  a  production  of  more  free  electrons.  If  the  electric  ﬁeld  is
sufﬁciently high, the number of free electrons will increase exponentially along the collision route until ulti-
mately an electron avalanche will form. As the fast-moving electrons in the gap disappear into the anode, they
leave behind the slower-moving ions, which gradually drift to the cathode where they liberate further electrons
with  a  probability  g.  When  the  height  of  the  positive  ion  avalanche  becomes  sufﬁciently  large  to  lead  to  a
regeneration of a starting electron, the discharge mechanism becomes self-sustaining and a spark bridges the
two electrodes. The condition for the Townsend breakdown in a short gap is given by
