STATORÂ—(1) The stationary part of a rotating electrical machine. The stator may be either the field or the 
armature, depending on the design of the machine [5]. (2) The stationary member of a synchro that 
consists of a cylindrical structure of slotted laminations on which three Y-connected coils are wound 
with their axes 120 degrees apart. Depending on the type of synchro, the stator's functions are similar to 
the primary or secondary windings of a transformer [15].
