Source Follower
Source-Follower Voltage Gain
We  will  now  consider  the  CD  JFET  conÔ¨Åguration,  which  is  also  known  as  the  source  follower.  A  basic  CD
circuit is shown in Fig. 24.17. The input signal is supplied to the gate of the JFET. The output is taken from
the source of the JFET, and the drain is connected directly to the VDD supply voltage, which is ac ground.
