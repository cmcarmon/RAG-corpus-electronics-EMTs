An example of the time domain analysis of an inductor circuit is shown in Figure 
2.7 where the inductor is connected in series with a resistor, a switch, and an ideal voltage 
source. Initially, the current through the inductor is zero and the switch goes from closed 
t = . Similar to the capacitor-resistor circuit, the time-domain behavior of this 
to open at 
circuit  can  be  determined  by  solving  the  first  order  differential  equation  ###.  The 
resulting  voltage  across  the  inductor  is  an  exponential  function  of  time  as  shown  in 
Figure ###.
