This situation changed in mid-1970s. Quantum leaps in
integrated circuit manufacturing technology led to the era of
VLSI systems. By 1980, hundreds of thousands transistors could
be reliably and economically fabricated on a single silicon chip.
With the transistor count per chip growing exponentially, it
became quite clear that to manage the design complexity of
VLSI circuits, IC design methodologies must be revolutionized.
In 1980, Mead and Conway championed the notion of struc-
tured VLSI design. In Mead and Conway’s (1980) seminal book
Introduction to VLSI Systems, the authors argued that a hier-
archical design style exhibiting regularity and locality must be
adopted to design millions of transistors on a single chip. A
novel architecture called systolic array was used as an example
that satisﬁes all these requirements.
