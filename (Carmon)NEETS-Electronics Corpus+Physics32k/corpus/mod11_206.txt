The output power produced is in the range of a few hundred microwatts, sufficient for many 
microwave applications. The frequency at which the oscillator operates is determined by the physical 
positioning of the tuner screw in the cavity. Changing the output frequency by this method is called 
MECHANICAL TUNING. In addition to mechanical tuning, tunnel-diode oscillators may be tuned 
electronically. One method is called BIAS TUNING and involves nothing more than changing the bias 
voltage to change the bias point on the characteristic curve of the tunnel-diode. Another method is called 
VARACTOR TUNING and requires the addition of a varactor to the basic circuit. Varactors were 
discussed in NEETS, Module 7, Introduction to Solid-State Devices, and Power Supplies, Chapter 3. 
Tuning is achieved by changing the voltage applied across the varactor which alters the capacitance of the 
tuned circuit.
