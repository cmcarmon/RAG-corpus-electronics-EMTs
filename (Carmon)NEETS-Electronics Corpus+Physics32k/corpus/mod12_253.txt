View (C) of figure 2-2 represents the same signal when scanned along the time and frequency axes
as it would be in an fm receiver. Variations in signal amplitude have no effect on the frequency and no
intelligence can be received. Note that the noise and interference components have also been suppressed
so that they have little effect on the received signal. Thus, if the intelligence variations were impressed as
changes along the frequency axis, and the receiving equipment were designed to respond to this type of
signal, then the effects of noise and interference would be practically eliminated. Frequency-shift keyed
circuits fulfill these conditions.
