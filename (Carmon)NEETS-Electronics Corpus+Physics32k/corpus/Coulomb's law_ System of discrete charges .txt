The law of superposition allows Coulomb's law to be extended to include any number of point charges. The force acting on a point charge due to a system of point charges is simply the vector addition of the individual forces acting alone on that point charge due to each one of the charges. The resulting force vector is parallel to the electric field vector at that point, with that point charge removed.
The force F on a small charge q at position r, due to a system of N discrete charges in vacuum is:

where qi and ri are the magnitude and position respectively of the ith charge, R̂i is a unit vector in the direction of Ri = r − ri (a vector pointing from charges qi to q).
