General Networking Concepts
Data  communication  networks  have  existed  since  about  1950.  The  early  networks  existed  primarily  for  the
purpose of connecting users of a large computer to the computer itself, with additional capability to provide
communications between computers of the same variety and having the same operating software. The lessons
learned during the ﬁrst twenty or so years of operation of these types of networks have been valuable in preparing
the way for modern networks. For the purposes of our current discussion, however, we will think of commu-
nication networks as being networks whose purpose is to interconnect a set of applications that are implemented
on hosts manufactured by possibly different vendors and managed by a variety of operating systems. Networking
capability is provided by software systems that implement standardized interfaces speciﬁcally designed for the
exchange of information among heterogeneous computers.
