Sometimes a regulator or governor is fitted to make engine overspeed impossible or less likely. For example:
Many steam engines use a centrifugal governor, which centrifugally closes a throttle to restrict steam flow as engine speed increases.
In motor vehicles automatic transmissions will change gear to prevent the engine from turning too quickly. Additionally, almost all modern vehicles are fitted with an electronic rev limiter device that will cut fuel supply or sparks to the engine to prevent overspeed.
Some aircraft have constant-speed units that automatically change propeller pitch to keep the engine running at the optimal speed.
Large diesel engines are sometimes fitted with a secondary protection device that actuates if the governor fails. This consists of a flap valve in the air intake. If the engine overspeeds, the air flow through the intake will rise to an abnormal level. This causes the flap valve to snap shut, starving the engine of air and shutting it down.
