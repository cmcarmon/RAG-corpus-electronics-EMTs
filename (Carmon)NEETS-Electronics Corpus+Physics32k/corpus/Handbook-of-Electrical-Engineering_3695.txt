Coercivity, Hc (Oe, A/m): The property of a magnetized body enabling it to resist reversal of its magnetization.
Compensation temperature, Tc ((cid:176)C, K): The temperature at which the magnetization of a material comprising
ferromagnetic  atoms  (e.g.,  Fe,  Co,  Ni)  and  rare  earth  atoms  (e.g.,  Gd,  Tb)  becomes  zero  because  the
magnetization of the sublattice of ferromagnetic atoms is canceled by the opposing magnetization of the
rare earth sublattice.
