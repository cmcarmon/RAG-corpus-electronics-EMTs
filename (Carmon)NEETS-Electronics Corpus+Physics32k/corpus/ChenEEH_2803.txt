where sx, sy, and sz are deﬁned in equations 9.113. Directly
inserting equation 9.113 into equation 9.114 and then trans-
forming into the time domain would lead to a convolution
between the tensor coefﬁcients and the E-ﬁeld. This is not
advisable because implementing this convolution would be
computationally intensive. As
shown by Gedney (1995,
1996), a much more efﬁcient approach is to deﬁne the proper
constitutive relationship to decouple the frequency-dependent
terms. Speciﬁcally, let:
