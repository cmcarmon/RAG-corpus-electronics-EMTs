The capacitance (C) of the photodiode and the resistance (R) of the load form the RC time
constant. The capacitance of the photodetector must be kept small to prevent the RC time constant from
limiting the response time. The photodiode capacitance consists mainly of the junction capacitance and
any capacitance relating to packaging. The RC time constant is given by tRC = RC.
