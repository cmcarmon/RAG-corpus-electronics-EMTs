Generation of wide-band FM can be done by various means. However, only the most common
and conceptually the simplest one, known as the direct method, is considered here. It employs
a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) as a modulator. A VCO is an oscillator whose oscillation
frequency is equal to the resonant frequency of a tuned circuit, as shown in Figure 15.2.12. The
frequency can be varied if either the inductance or the capacitance is made voltage-sensitive to
the message signal f (t).
