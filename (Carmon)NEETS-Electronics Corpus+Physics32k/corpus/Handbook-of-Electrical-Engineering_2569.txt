Consider  the  progress  of  a  signal  current  driven  by  e1  –  e2  and  entering  the  base  of  Q1.  It  will  ﬁrst  pass
through  Rg, then into the resistance  Rin at the base of Q1, and will arrive at the emitter of Q2. Here, if RX is
large, most of this signal current will pass into the resistance presented by the Q2 emitter and eventually out
of the  Q2 base via another Rg to ground. The total series resistance is therefore
