In modern VLSI design ﬂows, the design of standard arith-
metic units is available from design libraries. These units
employ binary encoding of numbers, such as one’s or two’s
complement, or sign magnitude encoding to perform ad-
ditions and multiplications. If nonstandard operations are
required, or if high performance components are needed, then
the design of special arithmetic units is necessary. In this case,
the choice of arithmetic system is of utmost importance.
