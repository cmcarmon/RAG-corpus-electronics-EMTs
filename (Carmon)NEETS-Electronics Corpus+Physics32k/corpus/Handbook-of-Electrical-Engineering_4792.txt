There are many growth methods for these ﬁlms. Table 49.4 lists the most important techniques along with
some  of  the  critical  parameters.  Wet  methods  use  metal  organic  compounds  in  liquid  form.  In  the  Sol-Gel
process  the  liquid  is  spun  onto  the  substrate.  The  wafer  is  then  heated,  typically  to  a  lower,  intermediate
temperature (around 300(cid:176)C). This spin-on and heat process is repeated until the desired thickness is reached.
At this temperature only an amorphous ﬁlm forms. The wafer is then heated to between 500 and 700(cid:176)C usually
in oxygen and the actual crystal growth takes place. Instead of simple long term heating (order of hours), rapid
thermal  annealing  (RTA)  is  often  used.  In  this  process  the  sample  is  only  brieﬂy  exposed  to  the  elevated
temperature,  usually  by  a  scanning  infrared  beam.  It  is  in  the  transition  between  the  low  decomposition
temperature and the ﬁring temperature that the pyrochlore tends to form. At the higher temperatures the more
volatile components have a tendency to evaporate, thus producing a chemically unbalanced compound which
also has a great propensity to form one or more of the pyrochlore phases. In the case of PZT, 5 to 10% excess
lead is usually incorporated which helps to form the desired perovskite material and compensates for the loss.
In  preparing  Sol-Gel  ﬁlms  it  is  generally  easy  to  prepare  the  compatible  liquid  compounds  of  the  major
constituents and the dopants. The composition is then readily adjusted by appropriately changing the ratio of
the constituents. Very ﬁne quality ﬁlms have been prepared by this method, including epitaxial ﬁlms.
