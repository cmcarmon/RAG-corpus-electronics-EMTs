The Lorentz force has the same form in both frames, though the fields differ, namely:





F

=
q

[


E

v

B


]

.


{\displaystyle \mathbf {F} =q\left[\mathbf {E} +\mathbf {v} \times \mathbf {B} \right].}

See Figure 1. To simplify, let the magnetic field point in the z-direction and vary with location x, and let the conductor translate in the positive x-direction with velocity v. Consequently, in the magnet frame where the conductor is moving, the Lorentz force points in the negative y-direction, perpendicular to both the velocity, and the B-field. The force on a charge, here due only to the B-field, is





F

{\displaystyle F_{y}=-qvB,}

while in the conductor frame where the magnet is moving, the force is also in the negative y-direction, and now due only to the E-field with a value:

{\displaystyle {F_{y}}'=qE'=-q\gamma vB.}

The two forces differ by the Lorentz factor γ. This difference is expected in a relativistic theory, however, due to the change in space-time between frames, as discussed next.
Relativity takes the Lorentz transformation of space-time suggested by invariance of Maxwell's equations and imposes it upon dynamics as well (a revision of Newton's laws of motion). In this example, the Lorentz transformation affects the x-direction only (the relative motion of the two frames is along the x-direction). The relations connecting time and space are ( primes denote the moving conductor frame ) :

γ
(

x

γ
(

,


{\displaystyle x'=\gamma (x-vt),\quad x=\gamma (x'+vt'),}






t

)
.


{\displaystyle t'=\gamma (t-{\frac {vx}{c^{2}}}),\quad t=\gamma (t'+{\frac {vx'}{c^{2}}}).}

These transformations lead to a change in the y-component of a force:







F

y



′

=

F

.


{\displaystyle {F_{y}}'=\gamma F_{y}.}

That is, within Lorentz invariance, force is not the same in all frames of reference, unlike Galilean invariance. But, from the earlier analysis based upon the Lorentz force law:




γ

F

y


=
−
q
γ

B
,




F

y



′

=
−
q
γ

,


{\displaystyle \gamma F_{y}=-q\gamma vB,\quad {F_{y}}'=-q\gamma vB,}

which agrees completely. So the force on the charge is not the same in both frames, but it transforms as expected according to relativity.
