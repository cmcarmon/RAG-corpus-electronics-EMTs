The capacitance that exists between the crystal holder plates (C3) may bypass unwanted signals
around the crystal; therefore, some method must be provided to balance out this capacitance. You
accomplish circuit balancing by applying out-of-phase voltages to neutralize any undesired signal
voltages. The tap on L3 permits proper impedance matching and is the balanced input to the next stage.
