The SNAP concept is to take the power of the modern computer, the ability to process information, 
and put that power in the hands of the work center sailors. The sailors can use the system to reduce the 
labor associated with the paperwork function. User terminals are placed in the different work centers for 
use by the work center supervisor. Each work center has a different access code. This access code or 
password prevents unauthorized entry into the main computer's program. Different levels of entry are also 
defined. The levels depend on a work center's need.
