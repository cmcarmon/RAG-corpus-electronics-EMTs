To help compare different orders of magnitude, this section lists distances starting at 10 Ym (1025 m or 1.1 billion light-years). At this scale, expansion of the universe becomes significant. Distance of these objects are derived from their measured redshifts, which depends on the cosmological models used.
13.7 Ym – 1.37 billion light-years – Length of the Sloan Great Wall
18 Ym – redshift 0.16 – 1.9 billion light-years – Distance to the quasar 3C 273 (light travel distance)
33 Ym – 3.5 billion light-years – Maximum distance of the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey (light travel distance)
37.8 Ym – 4 billion light-years – Length of the Huge-LQG
75 Ym – redshift 0.95 – 8 billion light-years – Approximate distance to the supernova SN 2002dd in the Hubble Deep Field North (light travel distance)
85 Ym – redshift 1.6 – 9 billion light-years – Approximate distance to the gamma ray burst GRB 990123 (light travel distance)
94.6 Ym – 10 billion light-years – Approximate distance to quasar OQ172
94.6 Ym – 10 billion light-years – Length of the Hercules-Corona Borealis Great Wall, one of the largest and most massive known cosmic structure.
