The neural network is placed in parallel with the system, and the error,  e, between the system outputs, y,
and  network  outputs, Ë†y,  is  used  to  train  the  network.  This  represents  a  classical supervised  learning  problem
for  which  the  teacher  (i.e.,  the  system)  provides  target  values  (i.e.,  system  outputs)  directly  in  the  output
coordinate system of the learner (i.e., the network model) [Jordan and Rumelhart, 1991].
