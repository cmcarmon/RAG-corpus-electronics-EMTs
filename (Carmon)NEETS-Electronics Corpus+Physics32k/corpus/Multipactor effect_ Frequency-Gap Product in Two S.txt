The conditions under which multipactor will occur in two surface multipactor can be described by a quantity called the frequency-gap product. Consider a two surface setup with the following definitions:




d


{\displaystyle d}
, distance or gap between the surfaces (called the mean free path)




ω


{\displaystyle \omega }
, angular frequency of the RF field





V

0




{\displaystyle V_{0}}
, peak plate to plate RF voltage





E

0




{\displaystyle E_{0}}
, peak electric field between the surfaces, equal to




V

0




{\displaystyle V_{0}}
/



d


{\displaystyle d}
.
The RF voltage varies sinusoidally. Consider the time at which the voltage at electrode A passes through 0 and starts to become negative. Assuming that there is at least 1 free electron near A, that electron will begin to accelerate to the right toward electrode B. It will continue to accelerate and reach a maximum velocity ½ of a cycle later just as the voltage at electrode B begins to become negative. If the electron(s) from electrode A strike electrode B at this time and produce additional free electrons, these new free electrons will begin to accelerate toward electrode A. The process may then repeat causing multipactor. We now find the relationship between the plate spacing, RF frequency, and RF voltage that causes the strongest multipactor resonance.
Consider a point in time at which electrons have just collided with electrode A at position -d/2. The electric field is at zero and is beginning to point to the left so that the newly freed electrons are accelerated toward the right. Newton’s equation of motion of the free electrons is
