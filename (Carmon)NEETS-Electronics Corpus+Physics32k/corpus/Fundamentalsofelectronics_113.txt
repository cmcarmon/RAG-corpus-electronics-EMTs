The capacitor stores charge and the relationship between the charge stored and the resultant voltage is
q = Cv. The constant of proportionality, the capacitance, has units of farads (F), and is named for the
English experimental physicist Michael Faraday7. As current is the rate of change of charge, the v-i relation
can be expressed in diï¬€erential or integral form.
