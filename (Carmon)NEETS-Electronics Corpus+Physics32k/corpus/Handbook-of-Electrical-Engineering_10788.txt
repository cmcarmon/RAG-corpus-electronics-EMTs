Electronic systems utilize large numbers of similar components over which the designer has very little control.
Quality  control  methods  can  be  used  in  the  procurement  and  manufacturing  phases.  However,  the  circuit
designer  has  no  control  over  the  design  reliability  of  the  devices  except  in  cases  such  as  custom-designed
integrated  circuits.  In  addition,  electronic  components  cannot  be  inspected  easily  because  of  encapsulation.
Although  gross  defects  can  be  easily  detected  by  suitable  testing  processes,  defects  that  are  not  immediately
effective (for example, weak mechanical bond of a lead-in conductor, material ﬂaws in semiconductors, defective
sealing, etc.) primarily contribute to unreliability. Temperature and voltage are the predominant failure-accel-
erating stresses for the majority of electronic components. As weaker components fail and are replaced by better
ones,  the  percentage  of  defects  in  a  population  is  reduced,  resulting  in  a  decreasing  hazard  rate. Wearout  is
rarely of signiﬁcance in the failure of electronic components and systems. The designer should be careful to
ensure  that  the  loads  (voltage,  current,  temperature)  are  within  rated  values  and  strive  for  a  design  that
minimizes hot spots and temperature rises. Parameter drifts and accidental short circuits at connections can
also lead to system failures. The circuit designer can follow a few basic rules to signiﬁcantly improve electronic
system reliability: reduce the number of adjustable components; avoid selection of components on the basis of
parameter  values  obtained  by  testing;  assemble  components  such  that  adjustments  are  easily  accessible;  and
partition circuits into subassemblies for easy testing and diagnosis of problems.
