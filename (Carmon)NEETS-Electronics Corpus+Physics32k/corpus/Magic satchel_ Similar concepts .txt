The term hammerspace describes the seemingly invisible place from which fictional characters, such as cartoon characters, pull out very large objects, such as mallets. Technically the term hammerspace is not used to refer to a magic satchel itself, but rather the area or pocket of space that a magic satchel occupies; a magic satchel is like a door to hammerspace.
The "bag of holding" is a similar concept in the role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons.
A real-world example is the clown car which often is used in the circus, in which numerous clowns clamber out of a tiny automobile.
