View (D) shows the complete oscillator circuit. Connecting the feedback network through coupling 
capacitor C2 to the base of Q1 forms a "closed loop" for feedback (shown by the solid arrows). Let's 
verify that the feedback is regenerative. Assume a positive signal on the base of Q1. The transistor 
conducts heavily when forward biased. This current flow through L1 and R1 causes the voltage across L1 
to increase. The voltage increase is inductively coupled to L2 and inverted. This action ensures that the 
voltage is positive at the base end of L2 and C1 and in phase with the base voltage. The positive signal is 
now coupled through C2 to the base of Q1. The regenerative feedback offsets the damping in the 
frequency-determining network and has sufficient amplitude to provide unity circuit gain.
