Railguns may also be miniaturized for inertial confinement nuclear fusion.
Fusion is triggered by very high temperature and pressure at the core.
Current technology calls for multiple lasers, usually over 100, to concurrently strike a fuel pellet, creating a symmetrical compressive pressure.
Railguns may be able to trigger fusion by firing energetic plasma from multiple directions. The process developed involves four key steps.Plasma is pumped into a chamber.
When the pressure is great enough, a diaphragm will rupture, sending gas down the rail.
Shortly afterwards, a sufficient voltage is applied to the rails, creating a conduction path of ionized gas.
This plasma is accelerated down the rail, eventually being ejected at a large velocity.

The rails and dimensions are on the order of centimetres.
