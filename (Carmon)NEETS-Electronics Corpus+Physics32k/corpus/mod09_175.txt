View (A) of figure 1-16 shows the electrical construction of a low-pass filter with an inductor 
inserted in series with one side of a line carrying both low and high frequencies. The opposition offered 
by the reactance will be small at the lower frequencies and great at the higher frequencies. In order to 
divert the undesired high frequencies back to the source, a capacitor must be added across the line to 
bypass the higher frequencies around the load, as shown in view (B).
