Wheatstone bridges are considered a superior means of resistance measurement to the se-
ries battery-movement-resistor meter circuit discussed in the last section. Unlike that circuit,
with all its nonlinearities (nonlinear scale) and associated inaccuracies, the bridge circuit is
linear (the mathematics describing its operation are based on simple ratios and proportions)
and quite accurate.
