In most cases, the fuse will perform its active function in response to two types of circuit conditions. The
ﬁrst is an overload condition, for instance, when a hair dryer, teakettle, toaster, and radio are plugged into the
same circuit. This overload condition will eventually cause the element to melt. The second condition is the
overcurrent condition, commonly called the short circuit or the fault condition. This can produce a drastic,
almost  instantaneous,  rise  in  current,  causing  the  element  to  melt  usually  in  less  than  a  quarter  of  a  cycle.
Factors that can lead to a fault condition include rodents in the electrical system, loose connections, dirt and
moisture, breakdown of insulation, foreign contaminants, and personal mistakes. Preventive maintenance and
care  can  reduce  these  causes.  Unfortunately,  none  of  us  are  perfect  and  faults  can  occur  in  virtually  every
electrical system—we must protect against them.
