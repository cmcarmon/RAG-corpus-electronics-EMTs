General Algorithm Development
Let F(u) be the scalar-valued multivariate objective function to
be minimized. If the ﬁrst and second derivatives of F are
available, a local quadratic model of the objective function
may be obtained by taking the ﬁrst three terms of the Taylor-
series expansion about a point uk in the parameter vector
space:
