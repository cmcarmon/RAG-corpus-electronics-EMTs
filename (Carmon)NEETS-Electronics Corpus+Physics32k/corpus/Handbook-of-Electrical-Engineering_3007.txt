which shows that the common base input resistance is a factor of (b
ac + 1) times smaller than the input resistance
of  the  common  emitter  cell.  The  resistance  reï¬‚ection  factor,  (b
ac  +  1),  in  Eq. (28.37)  represents  the  ratio  of
small signal emitter current to small signal base current. Accordingly, Eq. (28.37) is self-evident when it is noted
that  the  input  resistance  of  a  common  base  stage  is  referred  to  an  input  emitter  current,  whereas  the  input
resistance of its common emitter counterpart is referred to an input base current.
