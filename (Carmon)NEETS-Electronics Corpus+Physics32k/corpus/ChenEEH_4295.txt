Softswitch is an all-encompassing term for the next-gener-
ation communications systems that employ open standards
to create integrated networks with a decoupled service intelli-
gence capable of carrying voice, video, and data trafﬁc more
efﬁciently and with far greater value-added service potential
than is possible with existing circuit-switched networks. Soft-
switch-based networks will enable service providers to support
new, enhanced voice service features as well as offer new types
of multimedia applications in addition to integrating existing
wireline and wireless voice services with advanced data and
video services.
