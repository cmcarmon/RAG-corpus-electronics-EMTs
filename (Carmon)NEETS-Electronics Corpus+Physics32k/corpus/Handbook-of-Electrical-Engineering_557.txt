Precision Rectifying Circuits
A rectiﬁer is a device that allows current to pass through it in one direction only. A diode can serve as a rectiﬁer
because it permits generous current ﬂow in only one direction—the direction of forward bias. Rectiﬁcation is
the same as limiting at the 0-V level: all of the waveform below (or above) the zero-axis is eliminated. However,
a diode rectiﬁer has certain intervals of nonconduction and produces resulting “gaps” at the zero-crossing points
of the output voltage, due to the fact that the input must overcome the diode drop (0.7 V for silicon) before
