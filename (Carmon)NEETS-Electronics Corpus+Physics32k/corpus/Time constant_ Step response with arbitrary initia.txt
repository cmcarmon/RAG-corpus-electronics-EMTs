Suppose the forcing function is chosen as a step input so:

u

{\displaystyle {dV \over dt}+{\frac {1}{\tau }}V=f(t)=Au(t),}

with u(t) the Heaviside step function. The general solution to this equation for times t ≥ 0 s, assuming V(t=0) = V0 is:

{\displaystyle V(t)=V_{0}e^{-t/\tau }+A\tau \left(1-e^{-t/\tau }\right).}

(It may be observed that this response is the ω → 0 limit of the above response to a sinusoidal input.)
The long-time solution is time independent and independent of initial conditions:

{\displaystyle V_{\infty }=A\tau .}

The time constant remains the same for the same system regardless of the starting conditions. Simply stated, a system approaches its final, steady-state situation at a constant rate, regardless of how close it is to that value at any arbitrary starting point.
For example, consider an electric motor whose startup is well modeled by a first-order LTI system. Suppose that when started from rest, the motor takes ⅛ of a second to reach 63% of its nominal speed of 100 RPM, or 63 RPM—a shortfall of 37 RPM. Then it will be found that after the next ⅛ of a second, the motor has sped up an additional 23 RPM, which equals 63% of that 37 RPM difference. This brings it to 86 RPM—still 14 RPM low. After a third ⅛ of a second, the motor will have gained an additional 9 RPM (63% of that 14 RPM difference), putting it at 95 RPM.
In fact, given any initial speed s ≤ 100 RPM, ⅛ of a second later this particular motor will have gained an additional 0.63 × (100 − s) RPM.
