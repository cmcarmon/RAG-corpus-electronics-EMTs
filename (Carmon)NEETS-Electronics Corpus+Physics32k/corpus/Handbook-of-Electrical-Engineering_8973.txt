Scanners
Scanners  are  a  means  for  inputting  text  and/or  images  directly  into  the  computer  system,  thus  avoiding  the
need for retyping and redrawing information contained in other sources. It is a relatively convenient way to
avoid repetition if the data to be entered already exist in readable form. This is done by special image-recognition
software that accompanies the scanning hardware, and can transfer an entire image containing both text and
illustrations,  but  without  the  capability  to  modify  the  image.  However,  the  addition  of  optical  character
recognition (OCR) software allows the entered text to be modiÔ¨Åed as if it were entered by typewriter. This can
greatly simplify entering and editing text from some preexistent source and has resulted in a proliferation of
devices that can perform this function.
