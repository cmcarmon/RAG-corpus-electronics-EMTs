Digital logic and IC components
Digital electronic components, such as logic gates, manipulate digital signals 
that consist of just two possible voltage levels (high or low). Inside each digi-
tal component is a nearly complete circuit (power is external), consisting of 
individual transistors or other analog components. Circuit symbols for digital 
components represent the interconnection of several individual components 
that make up the circuitâ€™s logic. You can build the logic from scratch or obtain 
it in the form of an integrated circuit. Logic ICs usually contain several gates 
(not necessarily all of the same type) sharing a single power connection.
