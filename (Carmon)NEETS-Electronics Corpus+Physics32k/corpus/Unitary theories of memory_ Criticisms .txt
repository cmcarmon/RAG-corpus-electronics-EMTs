The most prevalent criticism of the unitary models is that they try to oversimplify many complex processes into a single mechanism. Studies have shown that short-term memory and long-term memory are two distinct processes that emphasize different levels of activation in the brain among different cortical areas. Furthermore, the rate of decay is much faster in short-term memory as opposed to long-term memory. The OSCAR model in particular does not account for this phenomenon. It also makes an assumption that memories are always circulating to different areas of the brain—never having a definite cortical space that stores the memory. While this transfer of storage is occurring, the rate of decay in the OSCAR model is either constant or non-existent. Both rates are implausible, as a constant rate of decay neglects all external factors that may contribute to a faster rate of decay (e.g. stress, focusing attention on other things). Failing to neglect decay at all is even more implausible as it makes two wrong assertions—memories are not forgotten, and when the information is remembered, it is remembered perfectly every time. While the unitary theories of memory may give attention to alternate factors that the working memory model had initially overlooked, new data has surfaced and the model has adapted to new findings. It is still the standard model of how short-term memory works, and it will continue to be the standard model until new evidence overturns it.
