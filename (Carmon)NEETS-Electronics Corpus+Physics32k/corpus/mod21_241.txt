A relatively new device on the test equipment scene is the logic analyzer. A logic analyzer provides
various functions that can assist you in maintenance, testing, and troubleshooting of equipment using
digital circuitry. From your standpoint, they are extremely useful in performing timing analysis. Most
logic analyzers have crt displays that can monitor up to 32 timing signals at the same time. A large
percentage of todayâ€™s digital equipment is designed with the logic analyzer in mind and have built-in
status or bus lines for your convenience in monitoring multiple signals at the same time. When
monitoring a bus line, you can readily determine, through visual displays, such things as the presence of
master clock signals or sequential timing events.
