To illustrate the applicability of the two techniques to ac circuit
analysis, consider the network in Fig. 3.10. All voltages and currents
are phasors and the impedance of each passive element is known.
In the node analysis case, the voltage V4 is known and the voltage
between V2 and V3 is constrained. Therefore, two of the four required
equations are
