The step input to the inverter results in a corresponding VS-step applied
to the RL circuit at the output of the inverter as illustrated in Figure 10.32c.
From the initial conditions, at t = 0, both iL and vL are 0. From this point on,
the situation is identical to that for the RL transient discussed in Section 10.2.1
with V used in place of VS. Therefore the analysis presented in Section 10.2.1
applies.
