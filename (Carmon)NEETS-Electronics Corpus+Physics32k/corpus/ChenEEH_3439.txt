Based on the rule 2, relay R2 acting as a backup for relay
R3 has to operate 0.5 sec after relay R3 should have
operated. This means that relay R2 has to have a delay
of 0.5 sec for the highest fault current seen by relay R3 to
meet the above mentioned criteria. Let us assume that the
highest fault current seen by relay R3 is at location next to
breaker B34 looking downstream from breaker B34, and
this current is equal to 306 A. In that case, the primary
fault current is equal to 306/10 ¼ 30.6 A. The selected
relay tap setting will produce a pick-up current of 30.6/5
¼ 6.12 A. From Figure 9.11, the time delay corresponding
to this pick-up value is 0.2 sec. Hence, if relay R3 fails to
operate, the relay R2 will operate as a backup with a time
delay of 0.2 sec þ 0.5 sec ¼ 0.7 sec. According to Figure
