At T1 the voltage across the capacitor and the input voltage are series aiding and result in −50 volts 
appearing at the output. At this time the diode is reverse biased and does not conduct. Because of the size 
of R and C, the capacitor discharges only 2 volts to approximately 23 volts from T1 to T2. Using 
Kirchhoff's voltage law to determine voltage in the circuit, we find that the output voltage decreases from 
−50 to −48 volts.
