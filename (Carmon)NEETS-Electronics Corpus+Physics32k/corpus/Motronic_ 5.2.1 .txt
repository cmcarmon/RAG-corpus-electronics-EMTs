Motronic 5.2.1 was used in Land Rover Discovery Series II and P38 Range Rovers that were built starting with late 1999. It was only used in cars equipped with V8 gasoline engines. This variant of the engine management system was adapted for off-road use. Unlike the Motronic system in BMW sedans, that uses a chassis accelerometer to differentiate between misfires and rough road, the Land Rover version used signal from ABS control unit to detect rough road conditions. This version of the system was integrated with body control module and anti-theft system.
