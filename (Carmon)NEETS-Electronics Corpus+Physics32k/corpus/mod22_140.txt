Logic instructions transform the digital computer into a system that is more than a high-speed adding 
machine. Using logic instructions, the programmer may construct a program with any number of alternate 
sequences. For example, through the use of logic instructions, a computer being used for maintenance 
inventory will have one sequence to follow if the number of a given item on hand is greater than the order 
amount and another sequence if it is smaller. The choice of which sequence to use will be made by the 
control section under the influence of the logic instruction. Logic instructions, thereby, provide the 
computer with the ability to make decisions based on the results of previously generated data. That is, the 
logic instructions permit the computer to select the proper program sequence to be executed from among 
the alternatives provided by the programmer.
