Satellite communications have unique advantages over conventional long distance transmissions. 
Satellite links are unaffected by the propagation variations that interfere with hf radio. They are also free 
from the high attenuation of wire or cable facilities and are capable of spanning long distances. The 
numerous repeater stations required for line-of-sight or troposcatter links are no longer needed. They 
furnish the reliability and flexibility of service that is needed to support a military operation.
