Menopause confers:
A possible but contentious increased risk of atherosclerosis. The risk of acute myocardial infarction and other cardiovascular diseases rises sharply after menopause, but the risk can be reduced by managing risk factors, such as tobacco smoking, hypertension, increased blood lipids and body weight.
Increased risk of osteopenia, osteoporosis, and accelerated lung function decline.
Women who experience menopause before 45 years of age have an increased risk of heart disease, death, and impaired lung function.
