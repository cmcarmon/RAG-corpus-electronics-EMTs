1. The discretization equation 3.11 is an approximation,
since only the Ô¨Årst two terms in the Taylor series expan-
sion are included. As a result of this approximation, the
numerically computed results contain an error at each
time step, called the local truncation error (LTE). In
general, the smaller the time step used, the smaller will
be the LTE. The normal expectation is that if the error
is reduced at each time step, then the overall error in
the numerical results will also be small.
