For a free, rigid beam, an impulse

{\displaystyle F=M{\frac {dv_{cm}}{dt}},}

where



M


{\displaystyle M}
is the mass of the beam. Similarly, the torque about the CM will change the angular velocity

{\displaystyle Fb=I{\frac {d\omega }{dt}},}

where

is the moment of inertia around the CM.
For any point P a distance

{\displaystyle dv_{net}=dv_{cm}-pd\omega \,}

{\displaystyle {\frac {dv_{net}}{dt}}=\left({\frac {1}{M}}-{\frac {pb}{I}}\right)F.}

When this acceleration is zero,
