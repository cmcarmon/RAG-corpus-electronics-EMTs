values in a (k, l, b)-LNS format are derived, and probabilities
p1(i) for each bit are computed. Then, pLNS
0!1(i) is computed as
in equation 1.33. The actual assertion probabilities for the bits
in an LNS word, pLNS
0!1(i), are depicted in Figure 1.5. It can be
seen that p0!1(i) for the more signiﬁcant bits is substantially
lower than p0!1(i) for the less signiﬁcant bits. Moreover, it can
be seen that p0!1(i) depends on b. This behavior, which is due
to the inherent data compression property of the logarithm
function, leads to a reduction of the average activity in the
entire word. The average activity savings percentage, Save, is
computed as:
