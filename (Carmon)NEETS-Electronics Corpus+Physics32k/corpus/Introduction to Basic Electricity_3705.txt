When less than 700 milliamperes of current flows, 
transistor Q3â€™s base-to-emitter voltage is less than 0.7 volt, 
keeping it shut off. When transistor Q3 is shut off, the cir-
cuit acts as if it does not exist. When the current exceeds 
700 milliamperes, the voltage dropped across resistor R6 
increases above 0.7 volt. This results in transistor Q3 con-
ducting through resistor R2, thus decreasing the voltage 
on the base of transistor Q1 and causing it to conduct less. 
The current cannot increase above 700 milliamperes. 
Changing the value of resistor R6 can vary the amount of 
current that can be limited. Increasing the value of resis-
tor R6 lowers the limit on current value.
