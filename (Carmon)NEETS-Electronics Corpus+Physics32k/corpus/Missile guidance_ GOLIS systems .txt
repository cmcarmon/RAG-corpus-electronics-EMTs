Whatever the mechanism used in a Go-Onto-Location-in-Space guidance system is, it must contain preset information about the target. These systems' main characteristic is the lack of a target tracker. The guidance computer and the missile tracker are located in the missile. The lack of target tracking in GOLIS necessarily implies Navigational Guidance.
Navigational guidance is any type of guidance executed by a system without a target tracker. The other two units are on board the missile. These systems are also known as self-contained guidance systems; however, they are not always entirely autonomous due to the missile trackers used. They are subdivided by their missile tracker's function as follows:

Entirely autonomous - Systems where the missile tracker does not depend on any external navigation source, and can be divided into:

Inertial Guidance

With Gimballed gyrostabilized platform or Fluid-suspended gyrostabilized platform
With Strapdown inertial guidance

Preset Guidance

Dependent on natural sources - Navigational guidance systems where the missile tracker depends on a natural external source:

Celestial Guidance
Astro-inertial guidance
Terrestrial Guidance

Topographic Reconnaissance (Ex: TERCOM)
Photographic Reconnaissance (Ex: DSMAC)

Magnetic guidance

Dependent on artificial sources - Navigational guidance systems where the missile tracker depends on an artificial external source:

Satellite Navigation

Global Positioning System (GPS)
GLObal NAvigation Satellite System (GLONASS)

Hyperbolic Navigation

DECCA
LORAN C
