together by copper rings. A low voltage is induced in these shorted windings by the rotating three-phase
stator field. Because of the short circuit, a relatively large current flows in the squirrel cage. This causes a
magnetic field that interacts with the rotating field of the stator. Because of the interaction, the rotor
begins to turn, following the stator field; the motor starts. We will run into squirrel cages again in other
applications, where they will be covered in more detail.
