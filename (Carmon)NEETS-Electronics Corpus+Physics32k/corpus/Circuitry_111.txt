Example 2.25 
 
Determine  the  effective  capacitance  of  the  circuit 
shown in Fig. 2.32. 
 
Solution 
 
The  circuit  of  Fig.  2.32  can  be  progressively 
simplified as shown in Fig. 2.33. The stages in this 
simplification are: 
 
(a)   C1 and  C2 are  in  parallel  and  they  can  be 
replaced by a single capacitor (CA) of (2 nF + 
 
 
4  nF) = 6 nF. 
(b)  CA appears  in  series  with  C3. These  two 
 
resistors can be replaced by a single capacitor 
(CB) of (6 nF Ã— 2 nF)/(6 nF + 2 nF) = 1.5 nF. 
 
(c)  CB appears  in  parallel  with  C4. These  two 
capacitors  can  be  replaced  by  a  single 
 
capacitance (C) of (1.5 nF + 4 nF) = 5.5 nF.
