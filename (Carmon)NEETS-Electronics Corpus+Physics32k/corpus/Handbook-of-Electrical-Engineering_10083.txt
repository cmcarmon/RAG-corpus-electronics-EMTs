error  ec  are  used  to  adapt  the  neural  controller.  The  model  reference  approach  depicted  in  Fig. 100.62  is
commonly  referred  to  as  implicit  model-following  in  adaptive  control  literature  [Narendra  and  Annaswamy,
1989]. This type of model-following is performed when the dynamics of the closed-loop system are forced to
asymptotically match the dynamics of the reference model. The method of explicit model-following is depicted
in Fig. 100.63. In this case, the reference model acts as a preÔ¨Ålter, and the value of the system output is forced
to asymptotically track the value of the reference model output [Narendra and Annaswamy, 1989].
