When ac voltage measurements are performed, the input impedance of the selected test equipment
determines the amount of energy removed from the circuit under test. If an ac meter is placed across a
high-impedance circuit, the meter may load the high-impedance circuit and disturb circuit conditions,
possibly to the point of causing the circuit to cease functioning. A dc electronic voltmeter, used in
conjunction with a rectifying probe, extracts only a small amount of energy from the circuit under test.
Another advantage of an electronic voltmeter over the analog voltmeter is that voltages of low values can
be accurately measured.
