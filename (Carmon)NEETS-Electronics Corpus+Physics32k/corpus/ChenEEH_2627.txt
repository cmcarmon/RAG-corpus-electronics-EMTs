The class of passive components that is usually constructed on
piezoelectric crystals or similar materials is called acoustic
microwave devices. These devices allow the conversion of
electromagnetic and mechanical energies within the bulk or
surface structure. The most popular microwave devices based
on this technology are generally known as surface acoustic
wave (SAW) devices. Because the velocity of ultrasonic waves
in crystals is in the order of 105 times lower than that of
electromagnetic waves, the microwave SAW circuits can be
made extremely compact. Usually, the SAW components are
loss-limited at higher frequency by characteristics of the trans-
ducers, and they are used for microwave frequency up to
several gigahertz ( 2 GHz). Higher frequency applications
are still subject of ongoing research. Well-known passive
SAW devices include Ô¨Ålters, delay lines, and resonators. Tech-
nical details on the microwave SAW devices and useful refer-
ences can be found in Chang (1989), Konishi (1991), and
Webster (1999).
