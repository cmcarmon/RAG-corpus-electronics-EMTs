Before	the	1900s,	a	scientist	named	William	Gilbert	addressed	a	proposal
concerning	electricity	and	magnetism;	according	to	him,	while	both	subjects	can	be
traced	to	attracting	and	repulsing	objects	within	a	circuit,	electricity	and
magnetism	are	different	concepts.	The	key	to	understanding	electromagnetism,
therefore,	is	to	understand	the	individual	terms;	particularly,	understand	their
relevance	and	distinction.
