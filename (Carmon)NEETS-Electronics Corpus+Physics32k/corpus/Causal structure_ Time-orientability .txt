At each point in



M


{\displaystyle M}
the timelike tangent vectors in the point's tangent space can be divided into two classes. To do this we first define an equivalence relation on pairs of timelike tangent vectors.
If



X


{\displaystyle X}
and



Y


{\displaystyle Y}
are two timelike tangent vectors at a point we say that



X


{\displaystyle X}
and



Y


{\displaystyle Y}
are equivalent (written



X
âˆ¼
Y


{\displaystyle X\sim Y}
) if




g
(
X
,
Y
)
<
0


{\displaystyle \,g(X,Y)<0}
.
There are then two equivalence classes which between them contain all timelike tangent vectors at the point. We can (arbitrarily) call one of these equivalence classes "future-directed" and call the other "past-directed". Physically this designation of the two classes of future- and past-directed timelike vectors corresponds to a choice of an arrow of time at the point. The future- and past-directed designations can be extended to null vectors at a point by continuity.
A Lorentzian manifold is time-orientable if a continuous designation of future-directed and past-directed for non-spacelike vectors can be made over the entire manifold.
