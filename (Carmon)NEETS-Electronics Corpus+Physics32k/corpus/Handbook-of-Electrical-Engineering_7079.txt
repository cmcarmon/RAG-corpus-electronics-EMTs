Kolmogorov Complexity
In the 1960s, the Russian mathematican Kolmogorov considered the question “What is the intrinsic descriptive
complexity of a binary string?” From the preceding discussion, it follows that if the binary string were a sequence
of i.i.d. random variables X1, X2, . . ., Xn , then on the average it would take nH(X) bits to represent the sequence.
But what if the bits were the ﬁrst million bits of the binary expansion of  p? In that case, the string appears
random but can be generated by a simple computer program. So if we wanted to send these million bits to
another location which has a computer, we could instead send the program and ask the computer to generate
these million bits. Thus, the descriptive complexity of p is quite small.
