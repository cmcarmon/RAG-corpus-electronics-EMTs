A package serves as protection for the transistor 
and provides a means of making electrical  connections 
to the emitter, base, and collector regions. The  package 
also serves as a heat sink, or an area from which heat 
can be extracted, removing excess heat from the 
 transistor and preventing heat damage. Many  different 
packages are available,  covering a wide range of 
 applications (Figure 31-3).
