The liquid crystal display differs from the gas plasma and electroluminescent displays in that it does 
not generate its own light for the picture elements. The LCD requires an external light source, often called 
a backlight, for computer applications. The liquid crystal material between the charged electrodes 
becomes translucent when voltage is applied and allows the backlight to shine through as a picture 
element.
