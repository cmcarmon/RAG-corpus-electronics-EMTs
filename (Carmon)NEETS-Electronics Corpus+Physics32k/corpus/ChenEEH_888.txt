Note that tcd must be known to determine each clock skew
within s. The inverse situation, however, is not true; that is, the
set of all clock skews in a circuit need not be known to
determine the corresponding clock schedule tcd. As is shown
in Sections 4.3.1 and 4.4, a small subset of clock skews (com-
pared to the total number of local data paths or clock skews)
uniquely determines all the skews in a circuit as well as the
different feasible clock schedules tcd. Finally, note that a given
feasible clock schedule s allows for many possible implementa-
tions tcd ¼ c þ t 1
where any speciﬁc constant
c implies a different tcd but the same s. Thus, the term clock
schedule is used to refer to tcd where the choice of the real
constant c 2 R1 is arbitrary.
