The S-SEED is also capable of performing optical logic functions such as NOR, OR, NAND, and AND. The
inputs will also be differential, thus still avoiding any critical biasing of the device. A method of achieving logic
gate operation is shown in Fig. 79.27. The logic level of the inputs will be deﬁned as the ratio of the optical
power on the two optical windows. When the power of the signal incident on the gi input is greater than the
i input, a logic “1” will be present on the input. On the other hand, when the power
power of the signal on the 
of the signal incident on the gi input is less than the power of the signal on the 
i input, a logic “0” will be
incident on the input.
