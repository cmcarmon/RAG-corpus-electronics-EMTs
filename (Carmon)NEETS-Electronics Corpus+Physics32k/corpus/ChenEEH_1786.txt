Multimedia streams require some guarantees on the error
characteristics of the communication network, and the best-
effort Internet cannot provide such guarantees because the
path that a packet follows from the source to the destination
is not Ô¨Åxed; hence, the network has no idea about the error
characteristics of each individual segment. Thus, the sender
application has no knowledge of the error characteristics of the
network and may end up using an error correction/detection
mechanism that may not be optimum.
