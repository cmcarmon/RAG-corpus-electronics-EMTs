FIGURE 5.6 Typical Doping Proﬁles Under the Emitter (of the Internal Transistor). (A) This graph shows the standard Si and SiGe-drift
transistor (typical Ge content  7–15%). (B) Shown here is a SiGe HBT (typical Ge content  20–30%) transistor. The location x ¼ 0 deﬁnes
the surface of the monosilicon and the E0 terminal; wBm and wC are the metallurgical widths of base and collector, respectively; xc is the
C0 terminal. Scales are approximate numbers. The SIC does not exist in the external transistor region. The collector substrate junction is not
shown here
