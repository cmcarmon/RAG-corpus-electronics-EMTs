m
P-based system: there is usually some
random access memory (RAM) for holding volatile data, at least one kind of read only memory (ROM) for
holding the control program, communication peripherals, including parallel interface(s), serial communication
adapter(s),  various  counting  and  timing  circuits  for  measuring  input  pulses,  and  analog/digital  converters.
Because  each  processor  has  an  external  clock,  usually  a  crystal  clock,  timing  intervals  can  be  determined  to
great precision. Many procedures have been developed to take advantage of this precision: voltage-to-frequency

P system, which then proceeds to accurately count them.
