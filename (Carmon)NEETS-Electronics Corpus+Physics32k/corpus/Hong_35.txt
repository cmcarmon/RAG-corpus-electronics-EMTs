 
Impedance  essentially  can  be  viewed  as  frequency-dependent  resistance.  While 
resistance of a circuit is the instantaneous ratio between voltage and current, impedance 
of a circuit is the ratio between voltage and current for steady-state sinusoidal signals, 
which can vary with of frequency. As the later parts of this section will show, the voltage 
and  current  caused  by  applying  a  steady-state  sinusoidal  signal  to  any  combination  of 
resistors,  capacitors,  and  inductors,  are  related  by  a  constant  factor  and  a  phase  shift. 
Therefore, impedance can be expressed by a complex constant using an extended version
