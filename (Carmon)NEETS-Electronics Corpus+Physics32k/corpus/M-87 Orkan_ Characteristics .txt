One battery of M-87 Orkans consist of:
four 8×8 launchers
four 8×8 resupply vehicles (each with 24 reload rockets)
one 8×8 command post vehicle
two 4×4 topographic survey light vehicles
two 4×4 observation post light vehicles
one 4×4 meteorological survey vehicle
The FAP 2832 vehicle with its base platform is fitted with a central tyre pressure regulation system which is operated by the driver from within the cab, and to provide a more stable firing platform four stabilisers are lowered to the ground by remote control one at either side to the rear of the second roadwheel and two at the very rear. When travelling, the launcher is traversed to the front and the whole launcher is covered by a tarpaulin cover with integral bows.
