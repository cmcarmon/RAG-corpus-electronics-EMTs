According to the values of xmn of Table 5.3, the order in
which the TM modes propagate along the z direction is
TM01, TM11, TM21, and so forth. The bandwidth of the ﬁrst
single-mode TM01 operation is 1.5933:1 (less than 2:1 of rec-
tangular waveguide). From the results in the Tables 5.2 and 5.3,
the order of the modes for circular waveguide is associated
with the values of xmn and x0
mn and the sequence of modes is as
follows: TE11, TM01, TE21, TE10, TM11, TE31, and so forth.
Because the zero of the Bessel function of the ﬁrst kind is the
same as the derivative of the Bessel function of order zero, the
TE0n and TM0n modes have same cutoff frequency and are
degenerate.
