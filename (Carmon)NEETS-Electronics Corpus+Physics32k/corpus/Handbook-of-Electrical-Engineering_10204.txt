the disadvantage that such operations would be less accurate than a regular machine tool. Finishing operations,
such as deburring, have provided excellent opportunities for robotic application. Force control systems have
proven  particularly  useful  in  regulating  the  contact  force  between  the  tool  and  the  edge  of  the  work  to  be
deburred. One such example for robotic deburring is given by Stepien et al. [1987]. In general, force-torque
sensors  mounted  at  the  robot  wrist  have  proven  extremely  useful  in  many  applications  in  processing  and
assembly operations. The Lord Corporation and JR3 are two manufacturers of such commercial sensors.
