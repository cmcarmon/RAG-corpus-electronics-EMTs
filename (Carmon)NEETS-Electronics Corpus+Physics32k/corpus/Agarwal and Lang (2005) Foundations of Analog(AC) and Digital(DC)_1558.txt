c) Consider Figure 10.106. This figure shows the use of a series of n buffers in which
BUFi has transistors that have a width x times that of BUFi − 1 and resistors that
are a factor x smaller than that of BUFi − 1. n is chosen such that CL is x times the
gate capacitance of BUFn. In other words, n satisfies the equation:
