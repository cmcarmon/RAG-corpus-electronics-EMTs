Notice that the first two constraints follow directly from the corresponding
constraints applied to lumped elements. Remember that a node is simply a
junction point of a set of wires, which are themselves lumped elements. So, the
first two constraints do not imply any new restrictions beyond those already
assumed for lumped elements.6 The third constraint for circuits, however,
imposes a stronger restriction on signal timescales than for elements, because a
circuit can have a much larger physical extent than a single element. The third
constraint says that the circuit must be much smaller in all its dimensions than
the wavelength of light at the highest operating frequency of interest.
