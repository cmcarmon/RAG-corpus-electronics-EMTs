One of the most popular models for describing friction is the Coulomb friction model. This model defines coefficients of static friction

{\displaystyle {\mu }_{s}\in \mathbb {R} }
and dynamic friction





μ


d


∈

R



{\displaystyle {\mu }_{d}\in \mathbb {R} }
such that





μ

{\displaystyle {\mu }_{s}>{\mu }_{d}}
. These coefficients describe the two types of friction forces in terms of the reaction forces acting on the bodies. More specifically, the static and dynamic friction force magnitudes

The value

s




{\displaystyle f_{s}}
defines a maximum magnitude for the friction force required to counter the tangential component of any external sum force applied on a relatively static body, such that it remains static. Thus, if the external force is large enough, static friction is unable to fully counter this force, at which point the body gains velocity and becomes subject to dynamic friction of magnitude

acting against the sliding velocity.
The Coulomb friction model effectively defines a friction cone within which the tangential component of a force exerted by one body on the surface of another in static contact, is countered by an equal and opposite force such that the static configuration is maintained. Conversely, if the force falls outside the cone, static friction gives way to dynamic friction.

Equations (6a), (6b), (7) and (8) describe the Coulomb friction model in terms of forces. By adapting the argument for instantaneous impulses, an impulse-based version of the Coulomb friction model may be derived, relating a frictional impulse
