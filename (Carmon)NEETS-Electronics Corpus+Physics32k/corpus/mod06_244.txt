In your study of triodes so far, you have seen that the output of a triode circuit is developed across
the tube. The output is caused by the voltage dropped across RL due to current flow from tube conduction.
In all the demonstrations of gain, we assumed that RL was held constant and current through the tube was
varied. In this manner we achieved a voltage gain. If the resistance of RL is changed by the designer, the
gain of a triode circuit can be either increased or decreased. This is fairly easy to understand. Assume that
a circuit is composed of a triode with a plate-load resistor of 100 kohms. If a +2 volt signal causes 2
additional milliamperes to conduct through the tube, the voltage drop across RL (the output) will be:
