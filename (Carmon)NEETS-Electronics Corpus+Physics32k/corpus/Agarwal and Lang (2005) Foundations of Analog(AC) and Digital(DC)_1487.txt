Figure 10.41 shows a clocked digital system in which several modules
are provided a global clock timebase produced by a single clock device. One
approach simply connects the clock signal generator to all the modules using
one long wire. This naive approach often fails because of the RC delay asso-
ciated with the long wire and the input capacitances of the driven modules.
Figure 10.42 shows a circuit model for the clock distribution system. We have
lumped the resistance of the wire into a single resistance Rwire. Although it is
not shown in Figure 10.42, the resistance of the gate driving the clock will also
appear in series with the resistance of the wire. The gate capacitors appear as
parallel loads on the wire and therefore add together to yield a large equivalent
capacitor:
