Since state variables take partial functions as values, they
are ﬂexible function symbols. We can access a particular
component value of a state variable. There is a problem,
however, associated with partial functions (i.e., many values
are undeﬁned). The above problem can easily be solved by
extending state variables into total functions in the following
way: for any n-ary state variable p, any tuple c 2 TERM(O),
and any state M,
if p(c) is undeﬁned under M, then let
M[p(c)] ¼ 0. The above extension is consistent with the se-
mantics of PrTN. Furthermore we can consider the meaning
[p(c)] of the function application p(c) as a mapping from
states to Nat using a postﬁx notation for function application
M[p(c)].
