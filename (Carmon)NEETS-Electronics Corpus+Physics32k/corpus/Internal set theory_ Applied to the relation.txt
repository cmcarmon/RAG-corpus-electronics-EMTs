If S is standard and finite, we take for the relation R(g, f): g and f are not equal and g is in S. Since "For every standard finite set F there is an element g in S such that g ≠ f for all f in F" is false (no such g exists when F = S), we may use Idealisation to tell us that "There is a G in S such that G ≠ f for all standard f" is also false, i.e. all the elements of S are standard.
If S is infinite, then we take for the relation R(g, f): g and f are not equal and g is in S. Since "For every standard finite set F there is an element g in S such that g ≠ f for all f in F" (the infinite set S is not a subset of the finite set F), we may use Idealisation to derive "There is a G in S such that G ≠ f for all standard f." In other words, every infinite set contains a non-standard element (many, in fact).
The power set of a standard finite set is standard (by Transfer) and finite, so all the subsets of a standard finite set are standard.
If S is non-standard, we take for the relation R(g, f): g and f are not equal and g is in S. Since "For every standard finite set F there is an element g in S such that g ≠ f for all f in F" (the non-standard set S is not a subset of the standard and finite set F), we may use Idealisation to derive "There is a G in S such that G ≠ f for all standard f." In other words, every non-standard set contains a non-standard element.
As a consequence of all these results, all the elements of a set S are standard if and only if S is standard and finite.
