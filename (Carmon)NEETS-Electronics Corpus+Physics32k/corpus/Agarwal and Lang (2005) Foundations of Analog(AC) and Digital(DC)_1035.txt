Figure 7.54 shows an amplifier cir-
cuit based on a BJT. This BJT amplifier configuration is called a common emitter amplifier
since the emitter terminal of the BJT is common across the input and output ports.
Using the piecewise-linear model for the BJT, determine the relationship between vO
and vIN, assuming that the BJT device is operating in its active region. Using this relation,
determine the values of vO for vIN = 1 V, 1.1 V, and 1.2 V, given that RI = 100 k,
RL = 10 k, Î² = 100, and VS = 10 V.
Figure 7.55 shows the equivalent circuit for the amplifier in which the BJT has been
replaced with its piecewise-linear model. Notice we can safely ignore the collector diode
and use the simple BJT model in Figure 7.52 since we are told that the BJT is operating in
its active region. Figure 7.56 further shows the active region subcircuit for the amplifier.
