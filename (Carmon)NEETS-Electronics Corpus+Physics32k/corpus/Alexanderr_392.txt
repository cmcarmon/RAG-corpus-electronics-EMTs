7. The step response is the response of the circuit to a sudden appli-
cation  of  a  dc  current  or  voltage.  Finding  the  step  response  of  a
ﬁrst-order  circuit  requires  the  initial  value 
the  ﬁnal  value
x(⬁),
and  the  time  constant  With  these  three  items,  we  obtain
the step response as
