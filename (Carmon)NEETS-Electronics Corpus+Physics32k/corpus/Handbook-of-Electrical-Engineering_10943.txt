The somatosensory receptors can be classiﬁed as mechanoreceptors, thermoreceptors, chemoreceptors, and
nociceptors. Numerous specializations of mechanoreceptors respond to speciﬁc attributes of mechanical stim-
ulation. Thermoreceptors are specialized to respond to either heat or cold stimuli. Nociceptors are unresponsive
until  the  stimulus  reaches  the  point  where  tissue  damage  is  imminent  and  are  usually  associated  with  pain.
Many  nociceptors  are  responsive  to  a  broad  spectrum  of  noxious  levels  of  mechanical,  heat,  and  chemical
stimuli. The muscles are equipped with specialized receptors to monitor and control muscle movement and
posture. Figure 113.1 illustrates a 
, which responds to the onset or termination of a pressure
stimulus applied to the skin.
