It is easy to model a class reference by adding some arc when
a class needs to access some public attribute of another class.
For example, Figure 9.4 illustrates simple class reference rela-
tionships where some operation in class C1 (p1 and t1) uses
some public attributes deﬁned in class C2 (p2 and t2), and
some operation in class C2 uses some public attributes deﬁned
in class C1. Figure 9.3 contains simple reference relationships
between classes Phil and Chop.
