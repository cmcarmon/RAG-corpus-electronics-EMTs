FM–CW radars can be used in airborne applications. For
example, an FM–CW altimeter can be placed in the aircraft
to measure height above the surface of the earth. A Doppler
navigation radar can measure the vector velocity relative to the
frame of reference of the antenna assembly. A Doppler naviga-
tion radar having forward and rearward beams is called a
Janus system. With the Janus system, the angular displace-
ment of the aircraft heading and the speed along the ground
track can be measured.
