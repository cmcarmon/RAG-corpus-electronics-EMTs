Electric power tools present a hazard in that 
electricity always wants to make a path to ground. 
Power tools should always have a grounded three-
wire cord. Never plug a three-prong cord into a 
two-prong receptacle, which removes the ground 
protection. All cords and extensions should be in 
original condition, with no cracks or frayed ends 
where they enter the plug or tool. If there is any sign 
of wear on the cord, discard it or repair the tool or 
extension cord.
