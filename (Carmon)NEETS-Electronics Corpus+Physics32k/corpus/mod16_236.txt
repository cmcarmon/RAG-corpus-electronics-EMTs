The rotation frequencies of recording devices and teletypewriter motors can be measured by the use
of a STROBOSCOPE. The stroboscope is an instrument that allows you to view rotating or reciprocating
objects intermittently and produces the optical effect of a slowing down or stopping motion. For example,
electric fan blades revolving at 1,800 rpm will appear stationary if you look at them under a light that
flashes uniformly 1,800 times per minute. At 1,799 flashes per minute, the blades will appear to rotate
forward at 1 rpm; at 1,801 flashes per minute, they will appear to rotate backward at 1 rpm.
