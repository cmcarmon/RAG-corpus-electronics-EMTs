In mathematics, Pugh's closing lemma is a result that links periodic orbit solutions of differential equations to chaotic behaviour. It can be formally stated as follows:
Let



f
:
M
→
M


{\displaystyle f:M\to M}
be a




C

1




{\displaystyle C^{1}}
diffeomorphism of a compact smooth manifold



M


{\displaystyle M}
. Given a nonwandering point



x


{\displaystyle x}
of



f


{\displaystyle f}
, there exists a diffeomorphism



g


{\displaystyle g}
arbitrarily close to



f


{\displaystyle f}
in the




C

{\displaystyle C^{1}}
topology of




Diff

1


⁡
(
M
)


{\displaystyle \operatorname {Diff} ^{1}(M)}
such that



x


{\displaystyle x}
is a periodic point of



g


{\displaystyle g}
.
