Other Pilot Protection Schemes
Several other types of pilot protection schemes are available. The choice of a speciÔ¨Åc scheme depends upon
many factors. Some of these factors are importance of the line to the power system, the available communication
medium, dependability of the communication medium, loading level of the transmission line, susceptibility of
the system to transient stability oscillations, presence of series or shunt compensating devices, multiterminal
lines, etc. A more complete discussion of all these issues will be found in the references [Westinghouse, 1982;
Blackburn, 1987; Horowitz and Phadke, 1992].
