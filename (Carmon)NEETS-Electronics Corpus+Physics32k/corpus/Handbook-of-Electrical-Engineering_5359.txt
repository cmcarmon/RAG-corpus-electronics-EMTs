System  efﬁciencies  have  promise  of  better  than  40%.  Certainly,  an  attractive  system  quality  is  that  it  offers
“24-hour power” potential, directly from a fueled burner. Selective emitters, primarily rare-earth oxides (e.g.,
Yb2O3 for Si, Ho2O3 for III-V alloys) and broadband emitters, black and gray-body types (e.g., SiC-based for
1300 to 1700K), are under consideration. The TPV cells are central to the system, and include InGaAs, GaSb,
and InGaAsSb. The GaSb cells have been introduced into commercial products. Thin-ﬁlm semiconductor cells
based on Ge and chalcopyrites are research projects. The radiation sources for terrestrial applications remain
the most intriguing. These vary from biomass related (e.g., burning of wood-powder) to industrial waste heat
(e.g., large furnaces used in ﬂoat-glass production). In any case, TPV is in the area of next-generation technol-
ogies that could make a very large contribution to energy generation.
