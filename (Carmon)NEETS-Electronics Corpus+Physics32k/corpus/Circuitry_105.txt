where  C is  the  capacitance  (in  farads),  )o is  the 
is  the  relative 
permittivity  of  free  space,  )r
permittivity  of the dielectric medium between the 
plates),  and  d is  the  separation  between  the  plates 
(in metres) and n is the total number of plates. 
 
Example 2.22 
 
A capacitor  consists  of  six  plates  each  of  area  20 
cm2 separated by a dielectric of relative permittivity
