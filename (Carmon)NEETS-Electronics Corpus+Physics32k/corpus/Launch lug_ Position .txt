In smaller rockets, one launch lug is generally considered enough, and is attached at the joint between one of the rocket's fins and the main rocket body. In larger, heavier model rockets, a second launch lug is generally added closer to the nose cone and lined up with the first, to provide additional support. The diameter of a launch lug generally closely matches that of the launch rod, although it is very slightly larger to minimize friction during the precarious first moments of flight. Length varies, ranging from less than a half-inch in smaller rockets to a few inches or longer in larger ones.
