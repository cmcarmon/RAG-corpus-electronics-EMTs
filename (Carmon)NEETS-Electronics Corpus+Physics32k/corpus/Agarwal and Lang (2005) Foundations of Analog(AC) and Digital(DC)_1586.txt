resistance of the pulldown MOSFETs in each of the inverters is RON. Assume that the
on resistance of the switch driven by the Store signal is also RON. The supply voltage is
VS and the threshold voltage for the MOSFETs is VT. In doing this problem, assume
that RP is much larger than either RON or RL.
