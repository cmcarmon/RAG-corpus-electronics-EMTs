The table at the end of this section equates gauge with inch diameter, circular mils, and
square inches for solid wire. The larger sizes of wire reach an end of the common gauge scale
(which naturally tops out at a value of 1), and are represented by a series of zeros.
”3/0”
is another way to represent ”000,” and is pronounced ”triple-ought.” Again, those acquainted
with shotguns should recognize the terminology, strange as it may sound. To make matters
even more confusing, there is more than one gauge ”standard” in use around the world. For
electrical conductor sizing, the American Wire Gauge (AWG), also known as the Brown and
Sharpe (B&S) gauge, is the measurement system of choice. In Canada and Great Britain, the
British Standard Wire Gauge (SWG) is the legal measurement system for electrical conductors.
Other wire gauge systems exist in the world for classifying wire diameter, such as the Stubs
steel wire gauge and the Steel Music Wire Gauge (MWG), but these measurement systems
apply to non-electrical wire use.
