The choice of signal type, for example current or voltage, often depends on
the availability of convenient transducers (elements that convert from one form
of energy to another
for example, sound to electricity), power considera-
tions, and the availability of appropriate circuit elements. Voltage is a popular
representation and is used throughout this book. We will also see several situ-
ations later in which a voltage signal is converted to a current signal and vice
versa as it is being processed in an electronic system.
