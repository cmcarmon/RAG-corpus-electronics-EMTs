Proposition 2
The area of circles is proportional to the square of their diameters.
Proposition 5
The volumes of two tetrahedra of the same height are proportional to the areas of their triangular bases.
Proposition 10
The volume of a cone is a third of the volume of the corresponding cylinder which has the same base and height.
Proposition 11
The volume of a cone (or cylinder) of the same height is proportional to the area of the base.
Proposition 12
The volume of a cone (or cylinder) that is similar to another is proportional to the cube of the ratio of the diameters of the bases.
Proposition 18
The volume of a sphere is proportional to the cube of its diameter.
