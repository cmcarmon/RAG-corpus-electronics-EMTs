To most efficiently use environmental resources such as light, plants generally synchronize their circadian rhythms to match the period of the environment. In a study published in 2005, it was shown that plants whose circadian period matched the period of the light-dark cycle in its environment had increased photosynthesis and growth. Using this knowledge, botanists can take advantage of a mutation in the toc1 gene that has been shown to decrease the period of a plant. It is plausible that these toc1 mutants can easily be used to produce plants in a shorter amount of time, with a smaller amount of energy.
