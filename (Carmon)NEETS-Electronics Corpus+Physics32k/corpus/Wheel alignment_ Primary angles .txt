The primary angles are the basic angle alignment of the wheels relative to each other and to the car body. These adjustments are the camber, caster and toe. On some cars, not all of these can be adjusted on every wheel.
These three parameters can be further categorized into front and rear (with no caster on the rear, typically not being steered wheels). In summary, the parameters are:
Front: Caster (left & right)
Front: Camber (left & right)
Front: Toe (left, right & total)
Rear: Camber (left & right)
Rear: Toe (left, right & total)
