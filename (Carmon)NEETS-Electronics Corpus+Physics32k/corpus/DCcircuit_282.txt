A common phrase heard in reference to electrical safety goes something like this: ”It’s not volt-
age that kills, its current!” While there is an element of truth to this, there’s more to understand
about shock hazard than this simple adage. If voltage presented no danger, no one would ever
print and display signs saying: DANGER – HIGH VOLTAGE!
