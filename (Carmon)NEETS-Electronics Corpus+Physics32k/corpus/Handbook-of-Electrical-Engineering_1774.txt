A more common and less computationally intense approach to nonuniform quantization is to use a com-
pandor  (compressorâ€“expander).  The  input  signal  is  passed  through  a  nonlinear  compressor  before  being
quantized uniformly. The output of the quantizer must then be expanded to the original dynamic range (see
Fig. 17.13). The compression and expansion functions can be determined so that the compandor approximates
a Max quantizer.
