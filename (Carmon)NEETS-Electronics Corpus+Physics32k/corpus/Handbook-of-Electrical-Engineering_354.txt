1Power companies charge their industrial customers not only for the average power they use but for the reactive power
they  return.  There  is  a  reason  for  this.  Suppose  a  given  power  system  is  to  deliver  a  Ô¨Åxed  amount  of  average  power  at  a
constant  voltage  amplitude.  Since  P  =  *V**I*  cos  q,  the  current  will  be  inversely  proportional  to  the  power  factor.  If  the
reactive power is high, the power factor will be low and a high current will be required to deliver the given power. To carry
a large current, the conductors carrying it to the customer must be correspondingly larger and better insulated, which means
a larger capital investment in physical plant and facilities. It may be cost effective for customers to try to reduce the reactive
power they require, even if they have to buy additional equipment to do so.
