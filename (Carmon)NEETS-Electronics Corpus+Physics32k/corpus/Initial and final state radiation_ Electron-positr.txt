The electron-positron annihilation interaction:





e

e

→
2
γ


{\displaystyle e^{+}e^{-}\to 2\gamma }

has a contribution from the second order Feynman diagram shown adjacent:
In the initial state (at the bottom; early time) there is one electron (e−) and one positron (e+) and in the final state (at the top; late time) there are two photons (γ).
Other states are possible. For example, at LEP, e+ + e− → e+ + e−, or e+ + e− → μ+ + μ− are processes where the initial state is an electron and a positron colliding to produce an electron and a positron or two muons of opposite charge: the final states.
