Synchronous Motor Analysis
Synchronous motor analysis may be conducted using either a round rotor or
salient  pole  model  for  the  motor.  The  round  rotor  model  is  used  in  the
following discussion. The equivalent circuit is shown in Fig. 66.13. The model
consists of two ac voltages V1 and V2 connected by an impedance Z = R + jX.
Analysis is facilitated by use of the phasor diagram shown in Fig. 66.14. The
power delivered through the impedance to the load is
