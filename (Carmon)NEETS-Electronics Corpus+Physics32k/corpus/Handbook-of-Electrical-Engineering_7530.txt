Logic Family Circuit Parameters
Digital circuits and systems operate with only two states, logic 1 and 0, usually represented by two different

voltage levels, a 
quantities dependent upon the speciﬁc family that is used. Minimum high logic levels and maximum low logic
levels are established by speciﬁcations for each family. Minimum device output levels for a logic high are called

Logic voltage level parameters are illustrated for selected prominent logic subfamilies in Table 79.3. As seen in
this illustration, there are many operational incompatibilities between major logic family types.
