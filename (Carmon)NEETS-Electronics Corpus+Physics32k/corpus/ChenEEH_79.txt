Average power P is deÔ¨Åned as the energy transferred per second
and can be calculated by integrating p(t) for 1s. Since the
voltage and current are periodic signals of the same frequency,
the average power is the energy per cycle multiplied by
the frequency f. Energy per cycle is calculated by integrating
p(t) over one cycle, that is, one period of the voltage or current
wave.
