where Y0 is the dc component of the output, Y1 is the amplitude of the fundamental component, and Y2, Y3 are
the amplitudes of the second and third harmonic components. The second harmonic distortion factor (HD2),
the third harmonic distortion factor (HD3), and the nth harmonic distortion factor (HDn) are deÔ¨Åned as
