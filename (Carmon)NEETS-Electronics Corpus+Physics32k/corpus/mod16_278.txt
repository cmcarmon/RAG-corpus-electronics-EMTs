The test signal applied to the crystal diode is also connected to the horizontal input of the
oscilloscope. The horizontal sweep represents the voltage applied to the diode under test. The voltage
developed across current-measuring resistor R2 is applied to the vertical input of the oscilloscope.
Because this voltage is proportional to the current through the diode being tested, the vertical deflection
will indicate crystal current. The resulting oscilloscope trace for a normal diode is similar to the curve
shown in figure 2-16.
