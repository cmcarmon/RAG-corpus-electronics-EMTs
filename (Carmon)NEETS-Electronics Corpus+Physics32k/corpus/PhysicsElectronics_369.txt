The behaviour of a diode depends on its polarity in the circuit (ﬁgure 4.2). If the diode is
reverse biased (positive potential on N-type material) the depletion region increases. The
only charge carriers able to support a net current across the PN junction are the minority
carriers and hence the reverse current is very small. A forward-biased diode (positive poten-
tial on P-type material) has a decreased depletion region; the majority carriers can diﬀuse
across the junction. The voltage may become high enough to eliminate the depletion region
entirely.
