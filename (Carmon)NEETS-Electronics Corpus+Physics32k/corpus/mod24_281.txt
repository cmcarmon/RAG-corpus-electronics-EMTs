Basically, fiber manufacturers use two methods to fabricate multimode and single mode glass fibers.
One method is vapor phase oxidation, and the other method is direct-melt process. In vapor phase
oxidation, gaseous metal halide compounds, dopant material, and oxygen are oxidized (burned) to form a
white silica powder (SiO2). Manufacturers call SiO2 the soot. Manufacturers deposit the soot on the
surface of a glass substrate (mandrel) or inside a hollow tube by one of the following three methods:
