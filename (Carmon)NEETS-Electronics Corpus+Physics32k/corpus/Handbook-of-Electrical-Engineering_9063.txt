Hammer-actuator systems have been designed with
one,  two  and  even  three  moving  piece  components.
With  the  one-piece  design,  the  mass  impacting  the
paper is largest, limiting this design to slower printers
(£650 lpm). To have less mass in the hammer impacting
the  ribbon/paper  set,  separate  parts  are  used  for  the
armature  and  the  impacting  hammer  (two-piece
design).  In  this  case,  most  of  the  kinetic  energy  from
the  pivoting  armature  is  transferred  to  the  hammer
without the large mass handicap of the ferromagnetic
armature. Of course, the residual energy in the arma-
ture must be absorbed and dissipated within the print-
head.  Further  design  improvements  are  possible  by
interposing a push rod between the the armature and
the hammer pieces (see Fig. 89.34). Since the lengths of
adjacent push rods can be made alternately short and
long, close packing of these actuator assemblies having
a  single  pivot  axis  is  possible. With  the  most  efﬁcient
designs, printing speeds of over 5000 lpm are possible.
Both  moving-coil  and  stored-energy  actuators  are
