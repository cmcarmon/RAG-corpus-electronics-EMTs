Only a portion of the optical radiation is amplified. For a particular laser structure, there are only
certain wavelengths that will be amplified by that laser. Amplification occurs when selected wavelengths,
also called laser modes, reflect back and forth through the cavity. For lasing to occur, the optical gain of
the selected modes must exceed the optical loss during one round-trip through the cavity. This process is
referred to as optical feedback.
