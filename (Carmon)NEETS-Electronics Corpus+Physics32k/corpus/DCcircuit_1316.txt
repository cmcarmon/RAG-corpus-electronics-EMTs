But wait . . . the fun is just beginning! Not only do we have more quantities to keep track of
with magnetism than with electricity, but we have several different systems of unit measure-
ment for each of these quantities. As with common quantities of length, weight, volume, and
temperature, we have both English and metric systems. However, there is actually more than
one metric system of units, and multiple metric systems are used in magnetic Ô¨Åeld measure-
ments! One is called the cgs, which stands for Centimeter-Gram-Second, denoting the root
measures upon which the whole system is based. The other was originally known as the mks
system, which stood for Meter-Kilogram-Second, which was later revised into another system,
called rmks, standing for Rationalized Meter-Kilogram-Second. This ended up being adopted
as an international standard and renamed SI (Systeme International).
