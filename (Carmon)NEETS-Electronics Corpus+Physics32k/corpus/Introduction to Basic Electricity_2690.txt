Inductors in AC circuits offer opposition to current 
flow. When an AC voltage is placed across an inductor, 
it creates a magnetic field. As the AC voltage changes 
polarity, it causes the magnetic field to expand and col-
lapse. It also induces a voltage in the inductor coil. This 
induced voltage is called a counter	electromotive	
force	(cemf); the greater the inductance, the greater 
the cemf. The cemf is out of phase with the applied 
voltage by 180Â° (Figure 25-1) and opposes the applied 
voltage. This opposition is as effective in reducing cur-
rent flow as a resistor.
