which  has  the  same  form  as  Eq.  (8.4).  More  speciﬁcally,  the  coefﬁ-
cients are the same (and that is important in determining the frequency
parameters)  but  the  variable  is  different.  (Likewise,  see  Eq.  (8.47).)
Hence,  the  characteristic  equation  for  the  series  RLC circuit  is  not
affected by the presence of the dc source.
