The Evaluation Problem
With unbounded computational power, Eq. (15.37) can be used to compute P(O|l ). However, it involves on
the  order  of  2TNT calculations,  because  the  summation  in  Eq.  (15.37)  has  NT+1  possible  sequences.  This  is
computationally infeasible even for small values of N and T.
