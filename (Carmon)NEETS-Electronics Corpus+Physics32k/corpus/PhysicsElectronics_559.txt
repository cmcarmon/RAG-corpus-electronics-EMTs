Quite often the single-transistor ampliﬁer discussed in the previous lectures does not provide
enough gain for an application, or more often, it does not combine gain with the desired input
and output impedance characteristics. Perhaps the most obvious solution (but generally not
the best) is to connect several single-transistor ampliﬁers, or stages, in tandem one after
the other. Because of DC biasing considerations, it is usually not practical to connect the
output of one stage directly to the input of another; some kind of coupling device must be
used that permits a change in the DC level between two stages.
