To convert from kilometers per hour to meters per hour, multiply the figure by 1,000 (hence the prefix kilo- from the ancient Greek language word for thousand).
To convert from meters per second to meters per hour, divide the figure by 3,600 (that is 60 * 60, i.e. 60 seconds for each of the 60 minutes).
