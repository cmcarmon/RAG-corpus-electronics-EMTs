In any switching operation between the plugs and jacks of a tty panel, the cord plug must be pulled 
from the looping jack before you remove the other plug from the set (machine) jack. Pulling the plug 
from the set jack first opens the circuits to the channel, causing all tty messages in the channel to be 
interrupted.
