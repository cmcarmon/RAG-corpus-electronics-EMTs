In physics, the acoustic wave equation governs the propagation of acoustic waves through a material medium. The form of the equation is a second order partial differential equation. The equation describes the evolution of acoustic pressure



p


{\displaystyle p}
or particle velocity u as a function of position x and time



t


{\displaystyle t}
. A simplified form of the equation describes acoustic waves in only one spatial dimension, while a more general form describes waves in three dimensions.
For lossy media, more intricate models need to be applied in order to take into account frequency-dependent attenuation and phase speed. Such models include acoustic wave equations that incorporate fractional derivative terms, see also the acoustic attenuation article or the survey paper.
