The  use  of  computers  in  the  design  of  control  systems  has  a  long  and  fairly  distinguished  history.  It  begins
before the dawn of the modern information age with the analog computing devices that were used to create
tables of ballistic data for artillery and anti-aircraft gunners and continues to the present day in which modern
desktop machines have computing power undreamed of when the classical and modern control theories were
laid down in the middle years of the twentieth century.
