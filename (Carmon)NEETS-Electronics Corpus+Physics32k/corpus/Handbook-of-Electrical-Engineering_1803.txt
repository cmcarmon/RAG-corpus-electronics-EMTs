constraint is imposed on the motion model to provide the necessary equations. Optical ﬂow can give useful
information  about  the  spatial  arrangement  of  the  objects  in  a  scene,  as  well  as  the  rate  of  change  of  those
objects. Horn [1986] also deﬁnes a motion ﬁeld, which is a two-dimensional velocity ﬁeld resulting from the
projection of the three-dimensional velocity ﬁeld of an object in the scene onto the image plane. The motion
ﬁeld and the optical ﬂow are not the same.
