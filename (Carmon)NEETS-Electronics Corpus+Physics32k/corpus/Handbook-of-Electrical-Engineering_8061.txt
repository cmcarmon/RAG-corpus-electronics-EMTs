includes a real-time clock for timing external events and a power-fail restart unit which restarts the system after
a power failure (including restoring volatile data). The system monitors trafﬁc at the intersection through the
use of loop detectors and controls the trafﬁc by changing the trafﬁc lights. Other components of the system
monitor and control pedestrian trafﬁc and provide an interface to the system for human operators.
