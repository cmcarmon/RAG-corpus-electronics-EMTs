In a standard Mitchell movement (also known as "straight Mitchell"), there are two separate groups of playersâ€”one group always sits North-South, and the other always sits East-West. North-South players remain at the same table throughout all rounds of play. After each round, boards move to the next lower numbered table (from table 1, boards go to the highest numbered table), and East-West pairs move to the next higher number table (at the highest numbered table, pairs move to table 1). Pairs are typically identified by the direction they are sitting, coupled with the table number they start at.
This arrangement can be followed without modification when there is an odd number of tables, with no additional pairs left over (no half-tables). Modifications to the straight Mitchell movement must be made whenever there is an even number of tables, or a half-table.
A straight Mitchell movement requires that the number of rounds played R is equal to or less than the number of tables T. Hence, if there are 8 tables and time to play 24 boards, a maximum of 8 rounds can be played and there will be 3 boards per round.
If it is desired to play one or two rounds more than the number of tables, a Hesitation Mitchell or Double Hesitation Mitchell movement may be used if feasible. Alternatively, a Howell type movement may be adopted.
