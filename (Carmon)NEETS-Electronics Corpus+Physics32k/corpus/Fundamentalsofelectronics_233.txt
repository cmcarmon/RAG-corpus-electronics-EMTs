3.15 Formal Circuit Methods: Node Method26
In some (complicated) cases, we cannot use the simpliﬁcation techniques—such as parallel or series combi-
nation rules—to solve for a circuit’s input-output relation. In other modules, we wrote v-i relations and
Kirchhoﬀ’s laws haphazardly, solving them more on intuition than procedure. We need a formal method
that produces a small, easy set of equations that lead directly to the input-output relation we seek. One
such technique is the node method.
