The face width of a gear is the length of teeth in an axial plane. For double helical, it does not include the gap.
Total face width is the actual dimension of a gear blank including the portion that exceeds the effective face width, or as in double helical gears where the total face width includes any distance or gap separating right hand and left hand helices.
For a cylindrical gear, effective face width is the portion that contacts the mating teeth. One member of a pair of gears may engage only a portion of its mate.
For a bevel gear, different definitions for effective face width are applicable.
