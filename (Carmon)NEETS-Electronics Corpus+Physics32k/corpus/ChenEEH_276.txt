Noise in digital (or large-signal) circuits is the perturbation
of one nonlinear signal, the noise victim, by a second non-
linear signal, the noise aggressor. The perturbation is intro-
duced by a parasitic coupling path that is resistive, capacitive,
or inductive in nature. Since digital systems are typically char-
acterized by voltage levels, digital noise is presented in terms of
voltage and voltage transients, vn(t) and dvn=dt.
