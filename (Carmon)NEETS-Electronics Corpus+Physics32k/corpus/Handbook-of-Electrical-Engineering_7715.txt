The DCU provides the interface between the IOP and the disk drives and is similar in functionality to IBM’s
storage  director.  It  oversees  the  data  transfers  between  devices  and  the  IOP’s  local  memory,  provides  speed
matching buffer storage, and transmits control signals and status information between the IOP and the devices.
Disk storage units (DSUs) are attached to the DCU through point-to-point connections. The DSU contains
the  disk  device  and  is  responsible  for  dealing  with  its  own  defect  management,  by  using  a  technique  called
sector slipping. Figure 80.13 summarizes the elements of the Cray I/O system.
