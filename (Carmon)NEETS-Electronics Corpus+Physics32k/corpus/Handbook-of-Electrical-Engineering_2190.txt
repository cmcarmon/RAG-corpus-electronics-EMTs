MATLAB is an integrated technical environment designed to provide accelerated DSP design capabilities. In
addition to the basic software package that contains powerful functions for numeric computations, advanced
graphical
graphics and visualization capabilities, a high-level programming language, and tools for designing 
user interfaces (GUI)
 that contain special-
ized  libraries  of  functions.  The  discussion  and  examples  that  follow  in  this  article  use  capabilities  from  the
Signal Processing Toolbox. Other toolboxes that are applicable to solving signal processing problems include
the following: Control Systems, Frequency Domain System Identiﬁcation, Fuzzy Logic, Higher-Order Spectral

-Analysis and
Analysis, Image Processing, LMI (Linear Matrix Inequality) Control, Model Predictive Control, 
Synthesis, Neural Networks, Optimization, Partial Differential Equations, QFT (Quantitation Feedback Theory)
Control,  Robust  Control,  Signal  Processing,  Splines,  Statistics,  Symbolic  Math,  System  Identiﬁcation,  and
Wavelets.
