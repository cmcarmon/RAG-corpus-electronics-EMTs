MASTER OSCILLATOR POWER AMPLIFIER.â€”For a transmitter to be stable, its oscillator 
must not be LOADED DOWN. This means that its antenna (which can present a varying impedance) 
must not be connected directly to the oscillator circuit. The rf oscillations must be sent through another 
circuit before they are fed to the antenna for good frequency stability to be obtained. That additional 
circuit is an rf power amplifier. Its purpose is to raise the amplitude of rf oscillations to the required 
output power level and isolate the oscillator from the antenna. Any transmitter consisting of an oscillator 
and a single-amplifier stage is called a master oscillator power amplifier transmitter (mopa), as shown in 
figure 1-29.
