In human gait, to travel a particular distance, chemical energy must be expended by the body. This relationship can be expressed by the dimensionless term, cost of transport (COT)., that describes the amount of metabolic energy needed to move a body a unit of distance. Healthy humans walking at self-selected speeds have a cost of transport of approximately 0.8 calorie/meter/kilogram. Depending on speed, stability conditions, and other internal and external factors, the cost of transport for gait can change. These measured metabolic changes are attributed to variations in step length, step width, and other parameters of gait, which have a direct bearing on COT
