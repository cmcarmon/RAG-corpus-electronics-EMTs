The drain-to-source	voltage	(EDS) has con-
trol over the depletion region within the JFET. As EDS 
increases, ID also increases. A point is then reached 
where ID levels off, increasing only slightly as EDS contin-
ues to rise. This occurs because the size of the depletion 
region has increased also, to the point where the chan-
nel is depleted of minority carriers and cannot allow ID 
to increase proportionally with EDS. The resistance of 
the channel also increases with an increase of EDS, with 
the result that ID increases at a slower rate. However, ID 
levels off because the depletion region expands and re-
duces the channelâ€™s width. When this occurs, ID is said 
to pinch off. The value of EDS required to pinch	off, 
or limit, ID is called the pinch-off	voltage	(EP). The 
manufacturer usually gives the EP for an EGS of 0. EP is 
always close to EGS(off) when EGS is equal to 0. When EP 
is equal to EGS, the drain current is pinched off.
