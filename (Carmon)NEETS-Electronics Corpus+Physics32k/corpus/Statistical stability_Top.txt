The phenomenon of statistical stability is one of the most surprising physical phenomena consists in weak dependence of statistics (i.e., functions of the sample) on the sample size, if this size is large. This effect is typical, for example, for relative frequencies (empirical probabilities) of mass events and averages. This phenomenon is widespread and so can be regarded as a fundamental natural phenomenon.
The physical nature of the statistical stability phenomenon is revealed by observing the mass events.
Currently two theories are known that describe this phenomenon. They are the classical probability theory, which has a long history of development, and the theory of hyper-random phenomena, created in recent decades.
