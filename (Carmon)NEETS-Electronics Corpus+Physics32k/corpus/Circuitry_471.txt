vice  versa).  Inverters  also  provide  extra  current 
drive  and,  like  buffers,  are  used  in  interfacing 
applications  where 
they  provide  a  means  of 
regularizing  logic  levels  present  at  the  input  or 
output of a digital system. The Boolean expression 
for the output, Y, of a buffer with an input, X, is: 
Y
