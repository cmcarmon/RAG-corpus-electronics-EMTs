The first two games of the EarthBound series, Mother and EarthBound respectively, the main characters could use PSI to teleport to any location they'd previously been. The action appears to involve running at accelerating speeds with an accompanying whirring sound before the actual teleportation takes place. The third game of the series, Mother 3, does not have the teleportation power, likely due to the much smaller overall setting.
