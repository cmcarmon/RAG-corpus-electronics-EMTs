An “illegal” or “unallowed” condition occurs when 
a high is applied to both the R and S inputs simultane-
ously. In this case, the Q and Q outputs both try to go 
low, but Q and Q cannot be in the same state at the 
same time without violating the definition of flip-flop 
operation. When the highs on the R and S inputs are 
removed simultaneously, both of the outputs attempt 
to go high. Because there is always some difference in 
the gates, one gate dominates and becomes high. This 
forces the other gate to remain low. An unpredictable 
mode of operation exists and therefore the output state 
of the flip-flop cannot be determined.
