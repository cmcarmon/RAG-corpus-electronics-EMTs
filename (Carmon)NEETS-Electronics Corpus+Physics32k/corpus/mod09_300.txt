Resistors RB, RF, and RC provide base and collector bias. Capacitor C E bypasses ac variations around 
the emitter resistor R E. Capacitors C1, C2, and C3 and resistors R1, R2, and R B form the feedback and 
phase-shifting network. Resistor R2 is variable for fine tuning to compensate for any small changes in 
value of the other components of the phase-shifting network.
