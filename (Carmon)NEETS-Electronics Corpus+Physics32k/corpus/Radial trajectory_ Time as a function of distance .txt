Given the separation and velocity at any time, and the total mass, it is possible to determine the position at any other time.
The first step is to determine the constant w. Use the sign of w to determine the orbit type.

{\displaystyle w={\frac {1}{x_{0}}}-{\frac {v_{0}^{2}}{2\mu }}}

where





x

{\displaystyle \textstyle x_{0}}
and





v

{\displaystyle \textstyle v_{0}}
are the separation and relative velocity at any time.
