In some cases, the optical source may be directly modulated by a incoming electrical signal that is
not a baseband signal. In these cases the original electrical signal generally modulates an electrical
subcarrier frequency. The most common form of analog subcarrier modulation in fiber optic systems is
frequency modulation (FM). The optical source is intensity modulated by the electrical subcarrier.
