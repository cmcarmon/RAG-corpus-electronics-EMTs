Devices are normally connected in pairs to form symmetric SEEDs as demonstrated in Fig. 31.11(a). These
can then be operated as optical logic ﬂip-ﬂop devices. They can be set in one of two bistable states by application
of incident light beams. The bistable state can be read out by similar light beams which measure the transmitted
intensity. The hysteresis curve is shown in Fig. 31.11(b). These and similar devices are the emerging building
blocks for optical logic and are sometimes referred to as smart pixels.
