in which the superscripts t and * stand for transpose and
conjugate complex, respectively. This equation is derived
from the principle of energy conservation. The magnitude of
S-parameters of a passive network is always equal to or smaller
than one, depending on whether it is lossless or lossy. From the
unitary condition, the correct relationship between the entries
of the S-matrix can be established.
