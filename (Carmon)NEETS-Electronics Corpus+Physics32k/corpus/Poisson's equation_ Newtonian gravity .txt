In the case of a gravitational field g due to an attracting massive object of density ρ, Gauss's law for gravity in differential form can be used to obtain the corresponding Poisson equation for gravity,

{\displaystyle \nabla \cdot {\mathbf {g} }=-4\pi G\rho ~.}

Since the gravitational field is conservative (and irrotational), it can be expressed in terms of a scalar potential Φ,

Substituting into Gauss's law

If the mass density is zero, Poisson's equation reduces to Laplace's equation. Using Green's Function, the potential at distance r from a central point mass m (i.e., the fundamental solution) is

{\displaystyle \phi (r)={\dfrac {-Gm}{r}}.}

which is equivalent to Newton's law of universal gravitation.
