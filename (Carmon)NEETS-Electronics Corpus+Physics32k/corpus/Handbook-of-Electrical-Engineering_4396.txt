The halides react with the oxygen in the temperature range of 1300–1600(cid:176)C to form oxide particles, which
are driven to the wall of the tube and subsequently consolidated into a glassy layer as the hottest part of the
ﬂame passes over. After the completion of one pass, the torch travels back and the next pass is begun. Depending
on the type of ﬁber (i.e., multimode or single-mode), a barrier layer or a cladding consisting of many thin
layers  is  ﬁrst  deposited  on  the  inside  surface  of  the  tube.  The  compositions  may  include  B2O3-P2O5-SiO2  or
F-P2O5-SiO2 for barrier layers and SiO2, F-SiO2, F-P2O5-SiO2, or F-GeO2-SiO2-P2O5 for cladding layers. After the
required number of barrier or cladding layers has been deposited the core is deposited. The core compositions
