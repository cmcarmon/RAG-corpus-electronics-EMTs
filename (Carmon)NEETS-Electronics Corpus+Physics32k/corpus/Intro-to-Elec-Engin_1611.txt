Common applications for these controllers are found in fan, pump, and crane drives. Figure
16.1.16 shows three-phase symmetrical ac voltage-controlled circuits for wye-connected and
delta-connected stators, in which the thyristors are ﬁred in the sequence that they are numbered,
with a phase difference of 60°. The four-quadrant operation with plugging is obtained by the use
of the typical circuit shown in Figure 16.1.17. Closed-loop speed-control systems have also been
developed for single-quadrant and multiquadrant operation. Induction motor starters that realize
energy savings are one of the ac voltage controller applications. However, one should look into
the problems associated with harmonics.
