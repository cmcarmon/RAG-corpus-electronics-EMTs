When you have decided which of these four possible troubles could be causing the symptoms, you 
have definite steps to take. If you surmise that there is an open winding, or windings shorted together or 
to ground, an ohmmeter continuity check will locate the trouble. If the turns of a winding are shorted 
together, you may not be able to detect a difference in winding resistance. Therefore, you need to connect 
a good transformer in the place of the old one and see if the symptoms are eliminated. Keep in mind that 
transformers are difficult to replace. Make absolutely sure that the trouble is not elsewhere in the circuit 
before you change the transformer.
