Similarly, the implementation of a nested Do-loop formula-
tion of DSP algorithms is actually a ‘‘mapping’’ process con-
sisting of
from abstract
operations to a piece of hardware. In contrast to general-
purpose computing, the underlying hardware is of the form
programmable digital signal processor or ASIC in array-like
structure.
