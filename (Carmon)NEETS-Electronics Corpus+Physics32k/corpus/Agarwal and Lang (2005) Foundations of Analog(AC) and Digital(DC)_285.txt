We are now ready to introduce a systematic method of solving circuits. It is
framed in the context of a simple class of circuits, namely circuits containing
only sources and linear resistors. Many of the important analysis issues can
be understood through the study of these circuits. Solving a circuit involves
determining all the branch currents and branch voltages in the circuit. In practice,
some currents or voltages may be more important than others, but we will not
make that distinction yet.
