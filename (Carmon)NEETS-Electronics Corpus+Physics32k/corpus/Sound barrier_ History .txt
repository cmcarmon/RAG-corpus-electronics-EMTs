Some common whips such as the bullwhip or stockwhip are able to move faster than sound: the tip of the whip breaks the sound barrier and causes a sharp crackâ€”literally a sonic boom. Firearms made after the 19th century have generally had a supersonic muzzle velocity.
The sound barrier may have been first breached by living beings some 150 million years ago. Some paleobiologists report that, based on computer models of their biomechanical capabilities, certain long-tailed dinosaurs such as Apatosaurus and Diplodocus may have possessed the ability to flick their tails at supersonic speeds, possibly used to generate an intimidating booming sound. This finding is theoretical and disputed by others in the field. Meteorites entering the Earth's atmosphere usually, if not always, descend faster than sound.
