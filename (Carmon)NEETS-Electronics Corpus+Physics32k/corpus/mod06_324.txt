Uhf tubes have very small electrodes placed close together and often are manufactured without
socket bases. By reducing all the physical dimensions of the tube by the same scale, the interelectrode-
capacitance and transit time effects are reduced, without reducing the amplification capability of the tube.
A disadvantage to this type of tube construction is that the power-handling capability of these tubes is
also reduced due to the close placement of the tube elements.
