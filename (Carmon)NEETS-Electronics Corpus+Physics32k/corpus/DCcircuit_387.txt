One very important thing to remember about measuring resistance is that it must only be
done on de-energized components! When the meter is in ”resistance” mode, it uses a small
internal battery to generate a tiny current through the component to be measured. By sensing
how difﬁcult it is to move this current through the component, the resistance of that component
can be determined and displayed. If there is any additional source of voltage in the meter-lead-
component-lead-meter loop to either aid or oppose the resistance-measuring current produced
by the meter, faulty readings will result. In a worse-case situation, the meter may even be
damaged by the external voltage.
