Optical Radiation
The  intensity  and  frequency  of  optical  radiation  are  parameters  of  growing  interest  and  utility  in  consumer
products  such  as  the  video  camera  and  home  security  systems  and  in  optical  communications  systems.  The
conversion of optical energy to electronic signals can be accomplished by several mechanisms (see radiant to
electronic transduction in Table 56.1); however, the most commonly used is the photogeneration of carriers in

this device is very similar to the diodes used in electronic circuits as rectiﬁers. The diode is operated in reverse
bias, where very little current normally ﬂows. When light is incident on the structure and is absorbed in the
semiconductor, energetic electrons are produced. These electrons ﬂow in response to the electric ﬁeld sustained
internally across the junction, producing an externally measurable current. The current magnitude is propor-
tional  to  the  light  intensity  and  also  depends  on  the  frequency  of  the  light.  Figure  56.2  shows  the  effects  of

for zero applied voltage, a net negative current ﬂows when the junction is illuminated. This device can therefore
also be a source of power (a solar cell).
