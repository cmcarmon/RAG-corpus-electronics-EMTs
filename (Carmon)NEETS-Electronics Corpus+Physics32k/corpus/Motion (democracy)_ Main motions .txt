A main motion is a motion whose introduction brings business before the assembly. If the motion has been proposed in advance of a conference or similar assembly, it may then be composited with other motion with related proposals.
A common next step is to allow the submission of amendments to the motion, which are motions in their own right. Again, these must often be seconded.
The motion is then considered by the assembly. A common procedure is to first read the motion, then take votes on each amendment to it in turn. In many cases, sections of motions and amendments can be debated and voted on separately by taking [the motion] in parts.
Once the amendments have been voted upon, the motion, with the adopted amendments, is debated and voted upon. Depending on the nature of the motion and the assembly, it may require a simple majority, a two-thirds majority or some other formulation in order to be adopted.
If the motion is adopted, it becomes part of the assembly's policy.
Motions are also used in debating events and competitions that mimic legislative assemblies or other deliberative bodies. Motions in this case are often prefaced with the phrase This House..., e.g. This House would ban smoking in public places.
