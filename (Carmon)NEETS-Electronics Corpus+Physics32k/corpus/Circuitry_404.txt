Output resistance 
 
The output resistance of an operational amplifier is 
defined  as  the  ratio  of  open-circuit  output  voltage 
to  short-circuit  output  current  expressed  in  ohms. 
Typical values of output resistance range from less 
than  10  G to  around  100  G depending  upon  the 
configuration and amount of feedback employed.  
  Output  resistance  is  the  ratio  of  open-circuit
