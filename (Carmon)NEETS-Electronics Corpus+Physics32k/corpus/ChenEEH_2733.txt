Although at ﬁrst glance equation 9.33 bears little resemblance
to the ideal case of equation 9.34, we can easily show that the
in the limit as Dx,
two dispersion relations are identical
Dy, Dz, and Dt approach zero. Qualitatively, this suggests
that numerical dispersion can be reduced to any degree that
is desired if we only use ﬁne enough FDTD gridding.
