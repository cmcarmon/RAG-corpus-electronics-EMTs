The force lines pictures are used for
1) Analysis of stress concentration (Figure1 and Figure 2): the number of the force lines increases in areas with stress concentration.
2) Optimization of structures: reinforcing the structure in the areas with concentration of force lines and deleting the components where there are no force lines.
Figure 4 shows 2 examples of old and new structures. The force lines distribution is more efficient for the second case. The visualization of force lines is a qualitative method, which is used as a supplementary method to the stress analysis.
