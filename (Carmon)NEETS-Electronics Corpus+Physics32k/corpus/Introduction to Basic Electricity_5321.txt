Whenever working on equipment, make notes and 
diagrams or take photographs for use when it is time to 
reassemble the unit. Most connectors are keyed against 
incorrect insertion or interchange of cables, but not 
all. Apparently identical screws may be of differing 
lengths or may have slightly different thread types. Lit-
tle parts may fit in more than one place or orientation. 
Pill bottles, film canisters, egg cartons, and plastic ice 
cube trays provide a handy place for sorting and stor-
ing screws and other small parts during disassembly.
