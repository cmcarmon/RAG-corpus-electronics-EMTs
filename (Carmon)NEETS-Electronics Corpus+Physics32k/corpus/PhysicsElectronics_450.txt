The behaviour of a transistor can be summarized by the characteristic curves shown in
ﬁgure 5.4. Each curve starts from zero in a nonlinear fashion, rises smoothly, then rounds a
knee to enter a region of essentially constant IC. This ﬂat region corresponds to the condition
where the depletion region at the base-emitter junction has essentially disappeared. To be
useful as a linear ampliﬁer, the transistor must be operated exclusively in the ﬂat region,
where the collector current is determined by the base current.
