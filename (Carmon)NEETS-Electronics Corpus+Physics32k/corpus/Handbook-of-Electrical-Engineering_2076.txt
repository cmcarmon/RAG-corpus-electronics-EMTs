Passive sonar signals are primarily modeled as random signals. Their ﬁrst-order PDFs are typically Gaussian;
one exception is a stable sinusoidal signal that is non-Gaussian and has a power spectral density function that
is a Dirac delta function in the frequency domain. However, in the ocean environment, an arbitrarily narrow
frequency width is never observed, and signals have some ﬁnite narrow bandwidth. Indeed, the full spectrum
of most underwater signals is quite “colorful.”
