When a circuit designer needs to accurately explore the performance of an op-amp circuit design, modern circuit
simulation programs (SPICE, PSPICE, and MICRO-CAP) permit a thorough study of circuit design, as related to
op-amp performance parameters. We have not here treated nonlinear op-amp performance limitations such as slew
rate, full-power bandwidth, and rated output. Surely, the op-amp circuit designer must be careful not to exceed the
output rating of the op amp, as related to maximum output voltage and current and output rate-of-change.
