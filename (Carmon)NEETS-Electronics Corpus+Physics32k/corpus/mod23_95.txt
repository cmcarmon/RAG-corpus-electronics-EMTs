Large changes from the ideal relative humidity cause tape to expand or contract and thus affect the
uniformity of a tape's oxide coating. High relative humidity causes the tape to stretch and increases the
tape's friction. The increased friction causes increased head wear, head clog by oxide particles, and
head-to-tape sticking. Low relative humidity encourages oxide shedding and increases static build-up on
tape surfaces, causing the tape to collect airborne contaminants.
