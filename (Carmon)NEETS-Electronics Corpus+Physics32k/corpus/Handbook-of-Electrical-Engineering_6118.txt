Dc converters for HVdc links and rectiﬁer loads have received much attention. The converter controls are
very fast acting and therefore a quasi steady state (QSS) model can be considered accurate. That is, the model
of the converter terminals contains no dynamic equations and in effect the link behaves as if it was in steady
state for every time solution of the ac system. While this may be so some time after a fault has been removed,
during and just after a fault the converters may well suffer from commutation failure or ﬁre through. These
events cannot be predicted or modeled with a QSS model. In this case, an appropriate method of analysis is
to combine a state variable model of the converter, which can model the ﬁring of the individual valves, with a
conventional multi-machine transient stability program containing a QSS model. During the period of maxi-
mum disturbance, the two models can operate together. Information about the overall system response is passed
to the state variable model at regular intervals. Similarly the results from the detailed converter model are passed
to the multi machine model overriding its own QSS model. As the disturbance reduces, the results from the
two different converter models converge and it is then only necessary to run the computationally inexpensive
QSS model within the multi machine transient stability program.
