velocity of propagation along the guide varies with frequency.
As a consequence of this characteristic of the guided wave
propagation, the Ô¨Åeld patterns of different frequency compon-
ents of a signal composing a band of frequencies do not main-
tain the same relationship as they propagate down the guide.
This phenomenon is known as dispersion, so termed after the
phenomenon of dispersion of colors by prism. The phase ve-
locity is actually the speed of the constant phase points on the
wave as it travels. So it does not represent the velocity of the
propagating energy in the waveguide. The energy propagates at
a speed equal to the group velocity (vg ) of the wave. The group
velocity is related to the cutoff frequency as the following:
