Problem 4.12: Where is that sound coming from?
We determine where sound is coming from because we have two ears and a brain. Sound travels at a
relatively slow speed and our brain uses the fact that sound will arrive at one ear before the other. As shown
in Figure 4.26, a sound coming from the right arrives at the left ear Ï„ seconds after it arrives at the right
ear.
