This approach, diagrammed in the top of Figure 13.1, is basic and power-
ful, in that it can handle both linear and nonlinear problems, but often it
involves substantial mathematical manipulations if the drive signals are other
than simple impulses, steps, or ramps. Thus there is considerable incentive to
look for easier methods of solution, even if these methods are more restricted
in application. Simplified methods are indeed possible if the system is linear
and time invariant, and we assume sinusoidal drive and focus on the steady-
state behavior. Because in many design applications such as audio amplifiers,
oscilloscope vertical amplifiers, and Op Amps linearity is a basic design con-
straint, systems that are linear or at least incrementally linear represent a large
and important class, hence are worthy of special attention. Further, more com-
plicated input signals such as square waves can be considered to be the sum of
many sinusoids; hence the problem can be solved by superposition.
