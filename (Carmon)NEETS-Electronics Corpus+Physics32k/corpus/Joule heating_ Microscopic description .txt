Joule heating is caused by interactions between charge carriers (usually electrons) and the body of the conductor (usually atomic ions).
A voltage difference between the ends of a conductor creates an electric field that accelerates charge carriers in the direction of the electric field, giving them kinetic energy. When the charged particles collide with ions in the conductor, the particles are scattered; their direction of motion becomes random rather than aligned with the electric field, which constitutes thermal motion. Thus, energy from the electrical field is converted into thermal energy.
