SKEW RAYS.â€”A possible path of propagation of skew rays is shown in figure 2-13. Figure 2-13,
view A, provides an angled view and view B provides a front view. Skew rays propagate without passing
through the center axis of the fiber. The acceptance angle for skew rays is larger than the acceptance
angle of meridional rays. This condition explains why skew rays outnumber meridional rays. Skew rays
are often used in the calculation of light acceptance in an optical fiber. The addition of skew rays
increases the amount of light capacity of a fiber. In large NA fibers, the increase may be significant.
