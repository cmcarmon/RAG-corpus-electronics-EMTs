A highly simpliÔ¨Åed two-input (idle bypass valve opening and
spark advance), two-output (engine speed and intake mani-
fold pressure) idle speed control model for IC engines was
developed by Yurkovich and Simpson (1997) and used in
this work. The model
includes intake manifold dynamics,
induction-to-power delay, and engine rotational dynamics
encompassed in the equations:
