In addition to standard, Constant Conductance Heat Pipes (CCHPs), there are a number of other types of heat pipes, including:
Vapor Chambers (planar heat pipes), which are used for heat flux transformation, and isothermalization of surfaces
Variable Conductance Heat Pipes (VCHPs), which use a Non-Condensable Gas (NCG) to change the heat pipe effective thermal conductivity as power or the heat sink conditions change
Pressure Controlled Heat Pipes (PCHPs), which are a VCHP where the volume of the reservoir, or the NCG mass can be changed, to give more precise temperature control
Diode Heat Pipes, which have a high thermal conductivity in the forward direction, and a low thermal conductivity in the reverse direction
Thermosyphons, which are heat pipes where the liquid is returned to the evaporator by gravitational/accelerational forces,
Rotating heat pipes, where the liquid is returned to the evaporator by centrifugal forces
