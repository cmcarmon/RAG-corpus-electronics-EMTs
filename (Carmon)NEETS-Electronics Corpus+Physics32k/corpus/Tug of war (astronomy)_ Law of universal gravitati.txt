According to Isaac Newton's law of universal gravitation

{\displaystyle F=G\cdot {\frac {m_{1}\cdot m_{2}}{d^{2}}}}

In this equation
F is the force of attraction
G is the gravitational constant
m1 and m2 are the masses of two bodies
d is the distance between the two bodies
The two main attraction forces on a satellite are the attraction of the Sun and the satellite's primary (the planet the satellite orbits). Therefore, the two forces are
