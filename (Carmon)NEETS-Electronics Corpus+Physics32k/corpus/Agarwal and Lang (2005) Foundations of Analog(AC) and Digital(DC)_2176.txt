(a result that an experienced analyst of RC circuits would have written down
directly). Waveforms appropriate to these equations are shown in Figure 15.29c.
An important issue of circuit performance is how long it takes the circuit
to recover from the effects of saturation. To this end, assume that the input
step is now reversed in polarity. The Op Amp will still be held in saturation by
−
the large positive voltage on the v
terminal, and will remain in saturation until
−
v
has decayed virtually to zero. Figure 15.29b remains the appropriate circuit
representation for this interval. Thus with vi = −V,
−t/RC
