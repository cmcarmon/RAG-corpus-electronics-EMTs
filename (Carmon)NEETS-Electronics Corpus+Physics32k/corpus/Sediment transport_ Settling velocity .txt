The settling velocity (also called the "fall velocity" or "terminal velocity") is a function of the particle Reynolds number. Generally, for small particles (laminar approximation), it can be calculated with Stokes' Law. For larger particles (turbulent particle Reynolds numbers), fall velocity is calculated with the turbulent drag law. Dietrich (1982) compiled a large amount of published data to which he empirically fit settling velocity curves. Ferguson and Church (2006) analytically combined the expressions for Stokes flow and a turbulent drag law into a single equation that works for all sizes of sediment, and successfully tested it against the data of Dietrich. Their equation is

.
In this equation ws is the sediment settling velocity, g is acceleration due to gravity, and D is mean sediment diameter.

is the kinematic viscosity of water, which is approximately 1.0 x 10−6 m2/s for water at 20 °C.

are constants related to the shape and smoothness of the grains.
The expression for fall velocity can be simplified so that it can be solved only in terms of D. We use the sieve diameters for natural grains,
