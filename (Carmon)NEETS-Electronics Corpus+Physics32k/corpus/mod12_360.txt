Some characteristic of the sampling pulses must be varied by the modulating signal for the
intelligence of the signal to be present in the pulsed wave. Figure 2-42 shows three typical waveforms in
which the pulse amplitude is varied by the amplitude of the modulating signal. View (A) represents a sine
wave of intelligence to be modulated on a transmitted carrier wave. View (B) shows the timing pulses
which determine the sampling interval. View (C) shows PULSE-AMPLITUDE MODULATION (pam) in
which the amplitude of each pulse is controlled by the instantaneous amplitude of the modulating signal at
the time of each pulse.
