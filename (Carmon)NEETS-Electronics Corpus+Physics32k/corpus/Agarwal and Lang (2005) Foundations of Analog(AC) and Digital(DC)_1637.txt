CMOS logic does not suffer static power dissipation. Referring to
Figure 11.17, provided the input vIN is at VS or 0, notice that the two com-
plementary MOSFETs are never on at the same time. Thus, there is never any
direct resistive path from the power supply to ground. Hence there is no static
power dissipation.
