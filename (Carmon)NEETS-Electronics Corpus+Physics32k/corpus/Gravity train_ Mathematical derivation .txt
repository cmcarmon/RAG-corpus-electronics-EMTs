Using the approximations that the Earth is perfectly spherical and of uniform density



ρ


{\displaystyle \rho }
, and the fact that within a uniform hollow sphere there is no gravity, the gravitational acceleration



a


{\displaystyle a}
experienced by a body within the Earth is proportional to the ratio of the distance from the center



r


{\displaystyle r}
to the Earth's radius



R


{\displaystyle R}
. This is because underground at distance



r


{\displaystyle r}
from the center is like being on the surface of a planet of radius



r


{\displaystyle r}
, within a hollow sphere which contributes nothing.

On the surface,
