Finding limit cycles in general is a very difficult problem. The number of limit cycles of a polynomial differential equation in the plane is the main object of the second part of Hilbert's sixteenth problem. It is unknown, for instance, whether there is any system




x
â€²

=
V
(
x
)


{\displaystyle x'=V(x)}
in the plane where both components of



V


{\displaystyle V}
are quadratic polynomials of the two variables, such that the system has more than 4 limit cycles.
