From your study of inductance and capacitance you know how inductive reactance and capacitive 
reactance act to oppose the flow of current in an ac circuit. However, there is another factor, the 
resistance, which also opposes the flow of the current. Since in practice ac circuits containing reactance 
also contain resistance, the two combine to oppose the flow of current. This combined opposition by the 
resistance and the reactance is called the IMPEDANCE, and is represented by the symbol Z.
