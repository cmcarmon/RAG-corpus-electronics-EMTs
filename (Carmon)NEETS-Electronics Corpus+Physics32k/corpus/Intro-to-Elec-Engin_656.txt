Rectiﬁer Circuits
A simple half-wave rectiﬁer using an ideal diode is shown in Figure 7.2.8(a). The sinusoidal
source voltage vS is shown in Figure 7.2.8(b). During the positive half-cycle of the source, the
ideal diode is forward-biased and closed so that the source voltage is directly connected across
the load. During the negative half-cycle of the source, the ideal diode is reverse-biased so that the
source voltage is disconnected from the load and the load voltage as well as the load current are
zero. The load voltage and current are of one polarity and hence said to be rectiﬁed. The output
current through the load resistance is shown in Figure 7.2.8(c).
