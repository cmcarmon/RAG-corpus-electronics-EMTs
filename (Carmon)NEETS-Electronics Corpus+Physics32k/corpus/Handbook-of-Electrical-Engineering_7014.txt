Divergence  is  zero  if  both  distributions  are  equal;  otherwise  it  is  strictly  positive.  The  maximization  in  Eq.
(73.78)  is  over  the  set  of  input  distributions. Although,  in  general,  there  is  no  closed-form  solution  for  that
optimization problem, an efÔ¨Åcient algorithm was obtained by Blahut and Arimoto in 1972 [Blahut, 1987]. The
distribution that attains the maximum in Eq. (73.78) determines the statistical behavior of optimal codes and,
thus, is of interest to the designer of the encoder. For the discrete memoryless channels mentioned above, the
capacity is given by the following examples.
