(b) Determine the resonant frequency and band-
width, given the voltage transfer function to
be 103/(s2 + 103s + 1010).
3.4.15 A simple parallel resonant circuit with L = 50 µH
is used to perform the frequency selection. The cir-
cuit is to be tuned to the ﬁrst station at a frequency
of 1000 kHz. In order to minimize the interaction
