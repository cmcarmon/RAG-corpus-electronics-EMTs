Remember there is no voltage drop across a straight piece of wire. Some plug-type fuseholders have test
points built in to allow you to check the voltage. To check for voltage on a clip-type fuseholder, check
each of the clips. The advantage of using a voltmeter to check for an open fuse is that the circuit does not
have to be deenergized and the fuse does not have to be removed.
