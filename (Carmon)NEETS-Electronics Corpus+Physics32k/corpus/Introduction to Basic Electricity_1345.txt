An element is the basic building block of nature. 
It is a substance that cannot be reduced to a simpler 
substance by chemical means. There are now over 100 
known elements (Appendix 1). Examples of elements 
are gold, silver, copper, and oxygen. 
The chemical combination of two or more elements 
is called a compound (Figure 10-1). A compound 
can be separated by chemical, but not by physical 
means. Examples of compounds are water, which 
consists of hydrogen and oxygen, and salt, which 
consists of sodium and chlorine. The smallest part 
of the compound that still retains the properties of 
the compound is called a molecule. A molecule is 
the chemical combination of two or more atoms. An 
atom is the smallest particle of an element that re-
tains the characteristic of the element. The physical 
combination of elements and compounds is called a 
mixture. Examples of mixtures include air, which 
is made up of oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and 
other gases, and salt water, which consists of salt 
and water.
