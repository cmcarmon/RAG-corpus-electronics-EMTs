Any  instrumentation  system  can  be  described  as  having  three  fundamental  components:  a  sensor,  a  signal
processor, and a display and/or storage device. Although all these components of the instrumentation system
are important, the sensor serves a special function in that it interfaces the instrument with the system being
(which in some cases may be referred
measured. In the case of biomedical instrumentation a 
to as a biosensor) is the interface between the electronic instrument and the biologic system. There are some
general concerns that are very important for any sensor in an instrumentation system regarding its ability to
effectively  carry  out  the  interface  function.  These  concerns  are  especially  important  for  biomedical  sensors,
since the sensor can affect the system being measured and the system can affect the sensor performance. Sensors
must be designed so that they minimize their interaction with the biologic host. It is important that the presence
of the sensor does not affect the variable being measured in the vicinity of the sensor as a result of the interaction
between  the  sensor  and  the  biologic  system.  If  the  sensor  is  placed  in  a  living  organism,  that  organism  will
probably  recognize  the  sensor  as  a  foreign  body  and  react  to  it.  This  may  in  fact  change  the  quantity  being
sensed in the vicinity of the sensor so that the measurement reï¬‚ects the foreign body reaction rather than a
central characteristic of the host.
