The ordering of the variables in the state variable vector x and
the input vector r is arbitrary. Once the ordering is chosen,
however, it must remain the same for all the variables in every
place of occurrence. In large circuits, topological methods may
be employed to systematically select the state variables and
write KCL and KVL equations. For want of space, these
methods are not described in this discussion. Next, this chap-
ter brieï¬‚y goes over the method for solving state variable
equations.
