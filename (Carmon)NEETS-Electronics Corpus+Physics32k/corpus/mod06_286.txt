The CLASS OF OPERATION OF AN AMPLIFIER is determined by the bias applied to a triode.
An amplifier operating as class A conducts continually through the duration of the input cycle. Class AB
operation occurs when the amplifier conducts for more than half but less than the entire duration of the
input cycle. A class B amplifier conducts for only 50% of the input cycle. The class C amplifier conducts
for less than half of the input cycle.
