is a useful analytical tool for converting time-domain signal descriptions into functions
The 
of a complex variable. This 
 description of a signal provides new insight into the analysis of
signals  and  systems.  In  addition,  the  Laplace  transform  method  often  simpliÔ¨Åes  the  calculations  involved  in
obtaining system response signals.
