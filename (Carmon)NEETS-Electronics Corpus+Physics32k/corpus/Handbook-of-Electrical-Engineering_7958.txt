Just as a combinational PAL device can be made more general purpose by the addition of a controlled output,
a  sequential  one  can  be  generalized  by  adding  programmable  macrocells  to  the  array  outputs.  The  output
macrocell of the 22V10 device, the Ô¨Årst of the generic PAL devices to be introduced, is shown in Fig. 81.46.
