Comparing the v i relationship for the resistor in Figure 1.28 to those for a
short circuit in Figure 1.30 and an open circuit in Figure 1.31, it is evident that
the short circuit and open circuit are limiting cases for a resistor. The resistor
approaches the short circuit case as its resistance approaches zero. The resistor
approaches the open circuit case as its resistance approaches infinity.
