Each digital variable is stored in a ﬁnite length register and is
represented by a ﬁnite number of bits, B. There are two
possible ways of representing data in binary form: ﬁxed
point and ﬂoating point. In ﬁxed point representation, the
binary point is ﬁxed at a speciﬁc location, and the implemen-
tation of arithmetic operations takes into account this prop-
erty. On the other hand, in the ﬂoating point representation,
each number is represented by two parameters: a mantissa,
