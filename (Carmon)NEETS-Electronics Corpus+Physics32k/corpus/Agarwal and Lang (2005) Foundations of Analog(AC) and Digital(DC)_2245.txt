Given the analytical expression for the diode characteristic, Equation 16.1, how
can we calculate the voltages and currents in a simple circuit such as Figure 16.5?
Depending on our requirements, as discussed in Chapter 4, we can use one
of the four methods of analyzing nonlinear circuits developed previously: (1)
analytical solutions, (2) graphical analysis, (3) piecewise-linear analysis, and (4)
incremental analysis. However, circuits with multiple diodes and other elements
get algebraically complex quickly and become virtually impossible to analyze
directly. Fortunately, it turns out that the dichotomous behavior of the diode
under forward bias and reverse bias allows us to decompose more complex
diode circuits into simple subcircuits, each of which can be independently ana-
lyzed using one of the four methods. This decomposition method is called the
method of assumed diode states.
