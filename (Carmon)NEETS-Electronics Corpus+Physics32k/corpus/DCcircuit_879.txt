total resistance of the circuit. With heavy enough thermocouple conductors, currents upwards
of hundreds of amps can be generated from a single pair of thermocouple junctions!
(Iâ€™ve
actually seen this in a laboratory experiment, using heavy bars of copper and copper/nickel
alloy to form the junctions and the circuit conductors.)
