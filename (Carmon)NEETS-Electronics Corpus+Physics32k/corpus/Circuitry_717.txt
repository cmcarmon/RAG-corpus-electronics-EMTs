checks  is  simply  the  internal  battery  in  your 
analogue multimeter. 
  Figure 15.6 shows the simplified internal circuit 
of an analogue multimeter on the resistance (ohms) 
range. This circuit consists of a battery (usually 1.5 
V,  3  V,  4.5  V  or  9  V)  connected  in  series  with  a 
preset ‘set-zero ohms’ control and a fixed, current-
limiting resistor, and a sensitive moving coil meter 
movement.  There  is  one  important  thing  to  note 
from this arrangement and it relates to the polarity 
of  the  meter  leads—the  red  meter  test  lead  will 
have a negative polarity whilst the black meter test 
lead  will  exhibit  a  positive  polarity  when  the 
instrument  is  switched  to  the  ‘ohms’  range.  (Note 
that the same does not apply to digital multimeters).  
  Unfortunately,  simple  go/no-go  checks  are 
unreliable when using a digital multimeter. Indeed, 
some  instruments  sometimes  fail  to  provide  any 
meaningful indication when carrying out resistance 
checks on diodes and transistors! However, if  you 
have  a  more  sophisticated  digital  instrument,  you 
may  find  that  it  already  has  a  built-in  diode  or 
transistor  checker—in  which  case  you  should  use 
this  facility  to  make  measurements  rather  than 
attempt to use simple go/no-go checking based on 
resistance measurements. 
  Because the output of the analogue multimeter is 
polarity  conscious,  it  can  be  used  to  check  the 
ability  of  a  component 
in  both 
directions.  Thus  it  can,  for  example,  be  used  to 
distinguish  between  a  resistor  and  a  diode.  The 
former  will  exhibit  the  same  resistance  whichever 
way  it  is  connected  to  the  multimeter.  The  diode, 
on the other hand, will have a resistance which will 
vary  significantly  depending  upon  which  way 
round it is connected.
