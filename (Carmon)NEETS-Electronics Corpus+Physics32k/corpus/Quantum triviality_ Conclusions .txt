As a result, the question of whether the Standard Model of particle physics is nontrivial (and whether elementary scalar Higgs particles can exist) remains a serious unresolved question. Theoretical proofs evidencing triviality of the scalar field theory have appeared, but the nature of the quantum field theories interacting with it remains an open question. Implications for the Standard Model and the resulting Higgs Boson mass bounds have also been discussed.
