digital system is transmitted over modems or direct connections in a series of 8-bit packets called bytes. The
number of bits per second that can be transmitted or received equates to the speed at which you can send or
 of the transmission line is expressed in bits per second,
receive information over the Internet. This 
normally in metric form.
