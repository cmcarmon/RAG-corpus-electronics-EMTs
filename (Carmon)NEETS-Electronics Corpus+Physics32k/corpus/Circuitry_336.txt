Example 7.1 
 
An amplifier produces an output voltage of 2 V for 
an input of 50 mV. If the input and output currents 
in  this  condition  are,  respectively,  4  mA  and  
200 mA, determine: 
 
(a) the voltage gain; 
(b) the current gain; 
(c) the power gain. 
 
Solution 
 
(a) The voltage gain is calculated from:
