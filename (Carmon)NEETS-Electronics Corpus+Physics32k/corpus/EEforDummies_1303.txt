Surplus is a loaded word. To some, it means junk that just fills up the garage, 
like musty canvas tents or funky fold‐up shovels that the US Army used back 
in the 1950s. To the true electronics buff, surplus has a different meaning: 
affordable components that help stretch the electronics‐building dollar.
