To complete the solution to Equation 12.4 we must determine the
unknown constants K1 and K2. To do so, we need specific information
about v. Mathematically, this is provided by specifying v and dv/dt at a particu-
lar time. That is, we provide initial conditions from which Equation 12.4 can be
integrated. However, in working with electronic circuits, it is more common to
know the states of a circuit at the initial time, and this information must be used
