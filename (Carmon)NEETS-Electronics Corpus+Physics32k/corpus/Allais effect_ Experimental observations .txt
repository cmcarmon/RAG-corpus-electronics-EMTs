Maurice Allais emphasized the "dynamic character" of the observed effects:
Besides Allais's own experiments, related research about a possible effect of the Moon's shielding, absorption or bending of the Sun's gravitational field have been conducted by various scientists. Some observations gave positive results and some failed to detect any noticeable effect.
