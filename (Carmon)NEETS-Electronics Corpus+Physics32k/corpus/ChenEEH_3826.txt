where  represents a two-dimensional convolution (see equa-
tion 4.16).
An illustrative case is when Z(m, n) ¼ 0. In this situation,
we can recover u(m, n) from v(m, n) by using a linear ﬁlter
g(m, n) such that g (m, n)  h(m, n) ¼ d(m, n). In the fre-
quency domain, this is equivalent to having:
