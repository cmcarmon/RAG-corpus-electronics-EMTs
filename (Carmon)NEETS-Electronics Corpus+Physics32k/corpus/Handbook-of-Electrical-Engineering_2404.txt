Thermomagnetic Errors
Temperature  gradients  can  set  up  spurious  emfs  that  can  modify  the  measured  Hall  voltage.  Most  of  these
effects, as well as misalignment of the Hall contacts in structure (b), can be averaged out by taking measurements
at  positive  and  negative  values  of  both  current  and  magnetic  Ô¨Åeld,  and  then  applying  Eq. (22.117)  and
Eq. (22.121).
