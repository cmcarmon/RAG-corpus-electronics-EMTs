The feed-point impedance can be further increased by using three or four properly spaced parallel 
conductors. Standard feed-line SPREADERS are used to maintain this spacing when required. In any 
folded dipole, the increase of impedance is the square of the number of conductors used in the radiator. 
Thus, a three-wire dipole has nine times (32) the feed-point impedance of a simple center-fed dipole. A 
second method of stepping up the impedance of a folded dipole is to use two conductors with different 
radii, as shown in view B.
