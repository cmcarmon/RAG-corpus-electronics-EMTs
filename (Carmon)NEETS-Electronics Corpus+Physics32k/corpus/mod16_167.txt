RESISTANCE BRIDGE.â€”An ac signal generator, as shown in figure 1-6, is used as the source of
voltage. Current from the generator passes through resistors R1 and R2, which are known as the ratio
arms, and through Rs and Rx. Again, Rx is known as resistance. Rs has a standard value and replaces R3 in
figure 1-6. When the voltage drops across R2 and Rs are equal, the voltage drops across R2 and Rx are
also equal; no difference of potential exists across the meter and no current flows through it. As we
discovered with the Wheatstone bridge, when no voltage appears across the meter, the following ratio is
true:
