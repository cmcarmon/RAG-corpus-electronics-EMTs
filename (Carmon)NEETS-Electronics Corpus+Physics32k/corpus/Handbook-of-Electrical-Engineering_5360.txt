Thin-Film Solar Cells
The arguments for thin-ﬁlm solar cells for terrestrial PV applications are primarily based on materials utiliza-
tion, large-scale manufacturing potential, and better energy economy for production. The focus of this section
is  on  the  major  approaches  based  on  copper  indium  selenide,  cadmium  telluride,  hydrogenated  amorphous
silicon (α Si:H), and dye-sensitized cells (see [Kazmerski, 1997]). Solar cells made from these materials generally
have lower voltages than predicted by the energy gap because the diode technology is not an ideal pn junction.
Additionally,  there  may  be  grain  boundary  losses  due  to  additional  minority  carrier  recombination,  parallel
diodes, and parasitic resistance, as shown in Fig. 60.12.
