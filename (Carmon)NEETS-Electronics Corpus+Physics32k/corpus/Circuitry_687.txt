Figure  14.30  shows  how  an  oscilloscope  can  be 
connected  to  display  the  waveforms  present  at 
various  points 
transistor  audio 
amplifier. To reduce the likelihood of picking up of 
hum and noise, the input to the oscilloscope is via a 
screened lead fitted with a probe. The ground (outer 
screen) is connected to the common 0V rail whilst 
the probe is simply moved around the circuit from 
point  to  point.  Note  that,  because  of  the  ground 
connection  to  the  oscilloscope  it  is  NOT  usually 
possible to display a waveform that appear ‘across’ 
a component (e.g. between the base and emitter of a 
transistor).    For  this  reason,  waveforms  are  nearly 
always displayed relative to ground (or common).
