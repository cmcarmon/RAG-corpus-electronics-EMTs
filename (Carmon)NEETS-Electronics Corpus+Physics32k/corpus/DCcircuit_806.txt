When the voltage between point 1 and the negative side of the battery is equal to the voltage
between point 2 and the negative side of the battery, the null detector will indicate zero and
the bridge is said to be ”balanced.” The bridge’s state of balance is solely dependent on the
ratios of Ra/Rb and R1/R2, and is quite independent of the supply voltage (battery). To measure
resistance with a Wheatstone bridge, an unknown resistance is connected in the place of Ra
or Rb, while the other three resistors are precision devices of known value. Either of the other
three resistors can be replaced or adjusted until the bridge is balanced, and when balance
has been reached the unknown resistor value can be determined from the ratios of the known
resistances.
