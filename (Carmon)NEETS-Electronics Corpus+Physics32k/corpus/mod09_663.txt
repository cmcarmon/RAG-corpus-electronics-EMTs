The circuit in figure 4-46, (view A) and (view B), may be used as a frequency divider. When used in 
this manner, Q1 is used as a single-swing blocking oscillator that is triggered when the voltage across C2 
becomes great enough to forward bias Q1. At other times, the transistor is cut off by the bias voltage 
developed in the section of R2 that is between the ground and the slide.
