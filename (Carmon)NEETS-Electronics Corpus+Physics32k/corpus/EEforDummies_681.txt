Our entire mathematics system is based on the 
number 10 (but if humans had only eight fingers, 
we might be using a base 8 system), so your 
brain has been trained to automatically think in 
decimal format (it’s like a math language). When 
you add two digits together, such as 6 and 7, 
you automatically interpret the result, 13, as “1 
group of 10 plus 3 groups of 1.” It’s ingrained in 
your brain, no less than your native language is.
Well, the binary system is like another language: 
It uses the same methodology, but it’s based on 
the number 2. If you want to represent a number 
greater than 1, you need more than one digit 
and each position in your number represents a 
power of two: 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, and so forth, which 
is the same as 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and so forth. The bit
