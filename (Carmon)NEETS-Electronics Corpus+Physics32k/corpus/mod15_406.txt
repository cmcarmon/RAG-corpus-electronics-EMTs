In actual operation, the step-by-step motor is driven by a step transmitter (rotary switch) as shown in
figure 4-3. As the switch is rotated, it applies voltage first to coil 1, and then in sequence to 1 and 2
together, coil 2 only, coils 2 and 3 together, coil 3 only, and so on, until the complete revolution is made.
As a result, the armature turns in 30-degree steps that follow the rotation of the rotary switch. The rotating
arm of the switch can be turned mechanically to angles between zero and 360ยบ in 30-degree steps. The
actual angle through which the arm is rotated depends on the specific data to be transmitted by the
system. Real systems may transmit data in greater or lesser steps than 30 degrees, depending on system
design.
