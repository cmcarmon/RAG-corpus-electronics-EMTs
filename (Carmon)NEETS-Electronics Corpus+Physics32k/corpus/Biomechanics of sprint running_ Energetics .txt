Di Prampero et al. mathematically quantifies the cost of the acceleration phase (first 30 m) sprint running through experimental testing. The subjects sprinted repeatedly on a track while radar determined their velocity. Additionally, it has been found in previous literature  that the energetics of sprinting on flat terrain is analogous to uphill running at a constant speed. The mathematical derivation process is loosely followed below:
In the initial phase of sprint running, the total acceleration acting on the body (




g
′



{\displaystyle g'}
) is the vectoral sum of the forward acceleration and earth’s acceleration due to gravity:





g
′

=
(
(

a

f


2


+

g

2


)

)

0.5




{\displaystyle g'=((a_{\text{f}}^{2}+g^{2}))^{0.5}}

The “Equivalent slope” (ES) when sprinting on flat ground is:





ES

=
tan
⁡

(

90
−
arctan
⁡

(

g
+

a

f



)


)



{\displaystyle {\text{ES}}=\tan \left(90-\arctan \left(g+a_{\text{f}}\right)\right)}

The “Equivalent normalized body mass” (EM) is then found to be:





EM

=



g
′

g


=


[

(




a

f


2



g

2




+
1

)

]


0.5




{\displaystyle {\text{EM}}={\frac {g'}{g}}=\left[\left({\frac {a_{\text{f}}^{2}}{g^{2}}}+1\right)\right]^{0.5}}

Following the data collection, the cost of sprinting (




C

sr




{\displaystyle C_{\text{sr}}}
) was found to be:





C

sr


=
(
(
155.4

)

−
(

)

−
(
43.3

)

3


+
(
46.3

)

+
19.5


ES

+

)


EM



{\displaystyle C_{\text{sr}}=((155.4\,{\text{ES}})^{5}-(30.4\,{\text{ES}})^{4}-(43.3\,{\text{ES}})^{3}+(46.3\,{\text{ES}})^{2}+19.5\,{\text{ES}}+3.6)\,{\text{EM}}}

The above equation does not take wind resistance into account, so considering the cost of running against wind resistance (




C

aer




{\displaystyle C_{\text{aer}}}
), which is known to be:





C

aer


=

k
′


v

2




{\displaystyle C_{\text{aer}}=k'v^{2}}

We combine the two equations to arrive at:





C

sr


=
(
(
155.4


ES


)

−
(
30.4


ES


)

4


−
(

)

Where

is the acceleration of the runner's body,
