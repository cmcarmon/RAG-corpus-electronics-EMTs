A general block diagram of a transistor ampliﬁer is shown in
Figure 11.8. It consists of three blocks with associated gains:
input matching (Gs), output matching (GL), and transistor
S-parameters (G0). Using transmission line theory, it can be
easily shown that the reﬂection coefﬁcients on the input and
output sides of the transistors are given as:
