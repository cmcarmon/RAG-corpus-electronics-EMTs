This chapter demonstrated previously that the memory aspect of capacitors and
inductors formalized using the notion of state variables provided many uses in
the analog domain. The same memory property can also be utilized in the digital
domain to implement digital memory using the analogous concept of digital
state. Digital memory is not only an important application of capacitors, but it
is of fundamental importance in its own right.
