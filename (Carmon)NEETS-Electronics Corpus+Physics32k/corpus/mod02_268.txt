You realize that the current and voltage are both going through their individual cycles at the same 
time during the period the ac voltage is impressed. The current does not go through part of its cycle 
(charging or discharging), stop, and wait for the voltage to catch up. The amplitude and polarity of the 
voltage and the amplitude and direction of the current are continually changing. Their positions with 
respect to each other and to the zero line at any electrical instant-any degree between zero and 360 
degrees-can be seen by reading upwards from the time-degree line. The current swing from the positive 
peak at zero degrees to the negative peak at 180 degrees is NOT a measure of the number of electrons, or 
the charge on the plates. It is a picture of the direction and strength of the current in relation to the polarity 
and strength of the voltage appearing across the plates.
