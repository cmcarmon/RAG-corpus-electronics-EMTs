With no input, D1 is forward biased and the +10 V battery is the output. C1 will charge to +10 V and 
hold this charge until the first pulse is applied. The battery establishes the dc reference level at +10 volts. 
The input wave shape at the top of view (B) is a square wave which alternates between +25 and âˆ’25 volts. 
The output wave shape is shown at the bottom half of view (B).
