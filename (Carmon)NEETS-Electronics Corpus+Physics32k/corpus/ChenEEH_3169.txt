To increase the leakage distance and to help maintain certain
parts of the insulator dry, it is common to see corrugations on
the underside of porcelain and glass cap and pin insulators.
The required dry-arcing and leakage distance is obtained by
stacking several units, the number being dependent on the
voltage level, contamination severity, and the proﬁle of the
insulator. Many shapes of porcelain and glass insulators have
been developed, as shown in Figure 5.2.
