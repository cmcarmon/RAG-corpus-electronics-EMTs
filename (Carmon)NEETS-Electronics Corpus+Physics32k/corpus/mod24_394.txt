During fusion, the surface tension of molten glass tends to realign the fibers on their outside
diameters, changing the initial alignment. When the fusion process is complete, a small core distortion
may be present. Small core distortions have negligible effects on light propagating through multimode
fibers. However, a small core distortion can significantly affect single mode fiber splice loss. The core
distortion, and the splice loss, can be reduced by limiting the arc discharge and decreasing the gap
distance between the two electrodes. This limits the region of molten glass. However, limiting the region
of molten glass reduces the tensile strength of the splice.
