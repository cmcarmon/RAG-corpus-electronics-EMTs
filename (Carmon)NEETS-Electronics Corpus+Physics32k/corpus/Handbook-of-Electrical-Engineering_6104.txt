point in the system during steady state operation. The power available is depicted as a region on the plane and
the boundaries of the region represent the critical operating limits of the system. The best known example of
a capability chart is the operating chart of a synchronous machine. The power available from the generator is
restricted by limiting values of the rotor current, stator current, turbine power (if a generator), and synchronous
stability limits. Capability charts have been produced for transmission lines and HVdc converters.
