MTW uses the âˆ’+++ metric convention, and dissuades the use of the ++++ metric and imaginary time coordinate ict. In the front endpapers, the sign conventions for the Einstein field equations are established and the conventions used by many other authors are listed.
The book also uses geometrized units, the gravitational constant G and speed of light in vacuum c each set to 1. The back endpapers contain a table of unit conversions.
