Mechanical trail is the perpendicular distance between the steering axis and the point of contact between the front wheel and the ground. It may also be referred to as normal trail. In each case, its value is equal to the numerator in the expression for trail.

Although the scientific understanding of bicycle steering remains incomplete, mechanical trail is certainly one of the most important variables in determining the handling characteristics of a bicycle. According to  a trail of zero could give some advantages:
the influence of the position of the center of pressure of wind forces coming from the side is eliminated
the wheel flop effect (see below) is eliminated
Skilled and alert riders may have more path control if the mechanical trail is lower while a higher trail is known to make a bicycle easier to ride "no hands" and thus more subjectively stable.
