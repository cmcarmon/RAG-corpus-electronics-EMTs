Internal features 
 
To begin to understand how timer circuits operate, 
it  is  worth  spending  a  few  moments  studying  the 
internal  circuitry  of  the  555  timer,  see  Fig.  12.1. 
Essentially,  the  device  comprises  two  operational 
amplifiers  (used  as  comparators  –  see  page  166) 
together  with  an  R-S  bistable  element  (see  page 
188). In addition, an inverting buffer (see page 185) 
is  incorporated  so  that  an  appreciable  current  can 
be  delivered  to  a  load.  The  main  features  of  the 
device are shown in Table 12.1. 
  Unlike standard TTL logic devices, the 555 timer 
can both source and sink current. It’s worth taking 
a little time to explain what we mean by these two 
terms: 
 
(a)   When  sourcing  current,  the  555’s  output 
(pin-3) is in the  high  state and current  will 
 
then flow out of the output pin into the load 
 
 
and down to 0V, as shown in Fig. 12.2(a).  
(b)     When  sinking  current,  the  555’s  output 
(pin-3)  is  in  the  low  state  in  which  case 
 
  current  will  flow  from  the  positive  supply 
(+Vcc) through the load and into the output 
 
 
(pin-3), as shown in Fig. 12.2(b).
