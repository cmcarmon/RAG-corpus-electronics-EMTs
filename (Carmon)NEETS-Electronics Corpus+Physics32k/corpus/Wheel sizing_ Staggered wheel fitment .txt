Staggered wheel fitment usually appears on the rear-wheel drive vehicles, when the rear wheels are 1 inch wider than the front ones. Such wheel setup may be found on the Ford Mustang, Infiniti G35, certain models of Mercedes and BMW, etc. A good example of such wheel combination is having 19x8 in front and 19x9.5 in the rear. Technically, wider wheels in the rear allow better grip with the road surface which is a performance benefit for better acceleration. The other setup option of staggered wheel fitment is having larger diameter wheels in the rear. For example, a vehicle may feature 19 inch wheels in front and 18 inches in the rear. Such setup may be found in the Chevrolet Corvette and Acura NSX. Features of staggered wheel fitment:
better grip with the road for improved acceleration;
better cornering ability;
the rear wheels cannot be rotated to the front and vice versa;
the front and rear wheels will have different tire sizes;
in case of improper installation the wheel may rub suspension or wheel arches.
