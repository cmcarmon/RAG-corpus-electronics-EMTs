Finally, let us consider the practical matter of the propagation speeds of elec-
tromagnetic waves. The lumped element approximation requires that we be
able to define a voltage V between a pair of element terminals and a current
through the terminal pair. Defining a current through the element means that
the current in must equal the current out. Now consider the following thought
experiment. Apply a current pulse at the terminal x of the filament at time
instant t and observe both the current into terminal x and the current out
of terminal y at a time instant t + dt very close to t. If the filament were
long enough or if dt were small enough, the finite speed of electromagnetic
waves might result in our measuring different values for the current in and the
current out.
