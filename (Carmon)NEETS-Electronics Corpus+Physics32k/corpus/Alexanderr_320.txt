picking the resistors and capacitors, many of which will result
in correct solutions. Extreme values of resistors and capacitors
will result in incorrect outputs. For example, low values of
resistors will overload the electronics. Picking values of
resistors that are too large will cause the op amps to stop
functioning as ideal devices. The limits can be determined from
the characteristics of the real op amp.
