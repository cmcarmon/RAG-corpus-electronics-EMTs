The voltage between the two conductors and the current ﬂowing through them will depend on distance x
along the transmission line as well as time. We express this dependence as v (x, t) and i (x, t). When we place
a sinusoidal source at one end of the transmission line, these voltages and currents will also be sinusoidal
because the transmission line model consists of linear circuit elements. As is customary in analyzing linear
circuits, we express voltages and currents as the real part of complex exponential signals, and write circuit
variables as a complex amplitude—here dependent on distance—times a complex exponential: v (x, t) =
