The maximum	zener	current	(iZM) is the maximum 
reverse current that can flow in a zener diode without 
exceeding the power dissipation rating specified by the 
manufacturer. The reverse	current	(ir) represents the 
leakage current before breakdown and is specified at a 
certain reverse	voltage	(er). The reverse voltage is 
approximately 80% of the zener voltage (EZ).
