Sometimes, some poles could be canceled in the rational function form of TF(s) so that they would not be
explicitly shown. However, even if some poles could be canceled by zeros, we still have to consider all poles in
the following criteria which is the statement of Theorem 12.5. The equilibrium state of the continuous system
[Eq. (12.7)] with constant input is unstable if at least one pole has a positive real part, and is stable if all poles
of  TF(s)  have  nonpositive  real  parts  and  all  poles  with  zero  real  parts  are  single.  The  equilibrium  state  is
asymptotically stable if and only if all poles of TF(s) have negative real parts; that is, all poles are in the left
half of the s-plane. Similarly, the equilibrium state of the discrete system [Eq. (12.8)] with constant input is
unstable if the absolute value of at least one pole is greater than one, and is stable if all poles of TF(z) have
absolute  values  less  than  or  equal  to  one  and  all  poles  with  unit  absolute  values  are  single.  The  equilibrium
state is asymptotically stable if and only if all poles of TF(z) have absolute values less than one; that is, the poles
are all inside the unit circle of the z-plane.
