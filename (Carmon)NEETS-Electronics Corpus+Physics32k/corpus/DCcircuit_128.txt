The mathematical symbol for each quantity is meaningful as well. The ”R” for resistance
and the ”V” for voltage are both self-explanatory, whereas ”I” for current seems a bit weird.
The ”I” is thought to have been meant to represent ”Intensity” (of electron ﬂow), and the other
symbol for voltage, ”E,” stands for ”Electromotive force.” From what research I’ve been able
to do, there seems to be some dispute over the meaning of ”I.” The symbols ”E” and ”V” are
interchangeable for the most part, although some texts reserve ”E” to represent voltage across
a source (such as a battery or generator) and ”V” to represent voltage across anything else.
