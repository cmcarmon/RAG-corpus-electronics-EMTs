The  three  eigenvalues  in  Eq.  (48.3)  give  three  values  of 
  and  hence  the  phase  velocities  of  three  waves
propagating in the direction of positive k and three propagating in the negative k direction. The eigenvectors
of the three forward solutions give the polarization vector for each, and they form a mutually perpendicular
triad. The polarization vector of one of the plane waves will be parallel, or almost parallel, to the k vector, and
it is called the longitudinal wave, or quasi-longitudinal if the displacement is not exactly parallel to k. The other
two waves will have mutually perpendicular polarization vectors, which will each be perpendicular, or almost
perpendicular, to the k vector. If the polarization is perpendicular, the wave is called a transverse or shear wave;
if almost perpendicular, it is called quasi-shear. The three waves propagate independently through the solid,
and their respective amplitudes depend on the exciting source.
