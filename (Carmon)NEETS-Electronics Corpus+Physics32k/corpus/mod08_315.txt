Figure 3-6 is the schematic diagram of a typical differential amplifier. Notice that there are two
inputs and two outputs. This circuit requires two transistors to provide the two inputs and two outputs. If
you look at one input and the transistor with which it is associated, you will see that each transistor is a
common-emitter amplifier for that input (input one and Q1; input two and Q2). R1 develops the signal at
input one for Q1, and R5 develops the signal at input two for Q2. R3 is the emitter resistor for both Q1
and Q2. Notice that R3 is NOT bypassed. This means that when a signal at input one affects the current
through Q1, that signal is developed by R3. (The current through Q1 must flow through R3; as this
current changes, the voltage developed across R3 changes.) When a signal is developed by R3, it is
applied to the emitter of Q2. In the same way, signals at input two affect the current of Q2, are developed
by R3, and are felt on the emitter of Q1. R2 develops the signal for output one, and R4 develops the
signal for output two.
