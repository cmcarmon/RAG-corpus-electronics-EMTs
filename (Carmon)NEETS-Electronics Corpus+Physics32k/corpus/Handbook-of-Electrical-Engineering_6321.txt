Europe began its HDTV project in mid-1986 with a joint initiative involving West Germany (Robert Bosch
GmbH), the Netherlands (NV Phillips), France (Thomson SA), and the United Kingdom (Thorn/EMI Plc.).
The  system,  termed  Eureka  95  or  D2-MAC,  has  1152  lines  per  frame,  50  ﬁelds  per  second,  2:1  interlaced
scanning, and a 16:9 aspect ratio. A more recent European proposed standard is for 1250 scanning lines at 50
ﬁelds per second. This is known as the Eureka EU95. It is signiﬁcant to note that the number of lines speciﬁed
by Eureka EU95 is exactly twice that of the PAL and SECAM standard currently in use. The ﬁeld rate is the same,
so it is possible to devise compatible systems that would permit reception of HDTV by current receivers (of course,
with adapters and without enhanced deﬁnition). The HDTV signal requires nominally 30 MHz of bandwidth.
