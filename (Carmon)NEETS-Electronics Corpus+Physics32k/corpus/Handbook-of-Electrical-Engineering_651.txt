The upper bound on the data rate of DCSK can be increased by using multilevel modulation schemes or by
keeping  the  transmitted  energy  constant  for  each  symbol.  The  FM-DCSK  technique,  which  is  an  antipodal
modulation scheme with constant bit energy, represents an optimal solution in the sense that its noise perfor-
mance is equal to that of DCSK but the data rate is not limited by the properties of the underlying chaotic signal.
