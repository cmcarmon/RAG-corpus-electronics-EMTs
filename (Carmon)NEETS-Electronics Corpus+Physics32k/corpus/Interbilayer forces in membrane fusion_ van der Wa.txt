These forces arise due to dipole-dipole interactions (induced/permanent) between molecules of bilayers. As molecules come closer, this attractive force arises due to the ordering of these dipoles; like in the case of magnets that align and attract each other as they approach. This also implies that any surface would experience a van der waals attraction. In bilayers, the form taken by van der Waals interaction potential VVDW is given by

{\displaystyle V_{VDW}=-{H \over 12\pi }*\left({1 \over z^{2}}-{2 \over (z+D)^{2}}+{1 \over (z+2D)^{2}}\right)}

where H is the Hamaker constant and D and z are the bilayers thickness and the distance of separation respectively.
