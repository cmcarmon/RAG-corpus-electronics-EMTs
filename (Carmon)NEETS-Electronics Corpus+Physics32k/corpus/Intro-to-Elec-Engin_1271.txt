*13.4.17 A separately excited dc generator with an
armature-circuit resistance Ra is operating at a
terminal voltage Vt, while delivering an armature
current Ia, and has a constant loss Pc. Find the
value of Ia for which the generator efÔ¨Åciency is
a maximum.
13.4.18 A 100-kW, 230-V, dc shunt generator, with Ra =
0.05 , and Rf = 57.5  has no-load rotational
loss (friction, windage, and core loss) of 1.8 kW.
