Most field rheostats for generators use resistors of alloy wire. They have a high specific resistance 
and a low temperature coefficient. These alloys include copper, nickel, manganese, and chromium. They 
are marked under trade names such as Nichrome, Advance, Manganin, and so forth. Some very large 
generators use cast-iron grids in place of rheostats, and motor-operated switching mechanisms to provide 
voltage control.
