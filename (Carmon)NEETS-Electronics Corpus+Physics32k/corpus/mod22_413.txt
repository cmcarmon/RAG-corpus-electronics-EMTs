The physical link or medium that is used to carry (or transmit) data from one location to another is a 
communications channel. It allows remotely located input/output devices to communicate directly with 
the computer's central processing unit (cpu). Telephone lines (often referred to as land lines) are a 
frequently used type of communications channel.
