In June 1948, a significant breakthrough took place in semiconductor development. This was the
discovery of POINT-CONTACT TRANSISTOR. Here at last was a semiconductor that could amplify.
This discovery brought the semiconductor back into competition with the electron tube. A year later,
JUNCTION DIODES and TRANSISTORS were developed. The junction transistor was found superior to
the point-contact type in many respects. By comparison, the junction transistor was more reliable,
generated less noise, and had higher power-handling ability than its point-contact brother. The junction
transistor became a rival of the electron tube in many uses previously uncontested.
