inverse scattering problem. Several conditions have been sug-
gested to ensure the existence and uniqueness of the solution.
It is quite difﬁcult, however, to deal with the instability, which
is inherent to the problem. The ill-posed problem, which
means that a small error on the data (i.e., the measured
scattered ﬁeld) may cause a large error on the solution (i.e.,
the reconstructed result), usually makes the inverse scattering
problem rather intractable. This phenomenon is even more
signiﬁcant from the viewpoint of applied science or engineer-
ing where the incompleteness of measured data and the
noise contamination are not uncommon. In addition, it can
be shown that the measured data depend nonlinearly on
the property function of the object. This nonlinearity also
increases the complexity of the inverse scattering problem.
