Destruction of an orbiting vehicle by an enemy is possible. However, destruction of a single 
communications satellite would be quite difficult and expensive. The cost would be excessive compared 
to the tactical advantage gained. It would be particularly difficult to destroy an entire multiple-satellite 
system such as the twenty-six random-orbit satellite system currently in use. The earth terminals offer a 
more attractive target for physical destruction. These can be protected by the same measures that are 
taken to protect other vital installations.
