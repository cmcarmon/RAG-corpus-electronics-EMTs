Leakage caused by the condensation of moisture is prevented in some rigid line applications by the
use of an inert gas, such as nitrogen, helium, or argon. It is pumped into the dielectric space of the line at
a pressure that can vary from 3 to 35 pounds per square inch. The inert gas is used to dry the line when it
is first installed and pressure is maintained to ensure that no moisture enters the line.
