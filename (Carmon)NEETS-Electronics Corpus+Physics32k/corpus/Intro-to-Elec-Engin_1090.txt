(13.1.3)
where K is a constant, Fr is the rotor mmf, and δr is the angle between the rotor mmf and the
resultant ﬂux or mmf axis. When the armature terminals are connected to a balanced polyphase
inﬁnite bus (which is a high-capacity, constant-voltage, constant-frequency system), the resultant
air-gap ﬂux φ is approximately constant, independent of the shaft load. Under normal operating
conditions the resultant air-gap ﬂux φ, which is given by Equation (12.2.13) as
