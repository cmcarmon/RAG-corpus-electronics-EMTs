When a crystalline material is put under differential stress, new dislocations form at the grain boundaries, and begin moving through the crystal.
Another way in which new dislocations can form are so called Frank–Read sources. These form when a dislocation is stopped at two places. The part of the dislocation in between will move along, causing the dislocation line to curve. This curving can continue until the dislocation curves over itself to form a circle. In the centre of such a circle the source will produce a new dislocation, and this process will produce a sequence of dislocations on top of each other. Frank–Read sources are also created when screw dislocations double cross-slip (change slip planes twice), as the jogs in the dislocation line pin the dislocation in the 3rd plane.
