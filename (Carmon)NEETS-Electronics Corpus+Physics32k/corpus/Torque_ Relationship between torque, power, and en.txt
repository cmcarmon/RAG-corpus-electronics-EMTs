If a force is allowed to act through a distance, it is doing mechanical work. Similarly, if torque is allowed to act through a rotational distance, it is doing work. Mathematically, for rotation about a fixed axis through the center of mass,

{\displaystyle W=\int _{\theta _{1}}^{\theta _{2}}\tau \ \mathrm {d} \theta ,}

where W is work, τ is torque, and θ1 and θ2 represent (respectively) the initial and final angular positions of the body.
