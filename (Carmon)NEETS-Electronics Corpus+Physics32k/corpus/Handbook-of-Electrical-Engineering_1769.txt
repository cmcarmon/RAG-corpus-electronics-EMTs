Quantization
Quantization is the process of converting the continuous-valued amplitude of the video signal into a discrete-
valued representation, i.e., a ﬁnite set of numbers. The output of the quantizer is characterized by quantities
that are limited to a ﬁnite number of values. The process is a many-to-one mapping, and thus there is a loss
of information. The quantized signal can be modeled as
