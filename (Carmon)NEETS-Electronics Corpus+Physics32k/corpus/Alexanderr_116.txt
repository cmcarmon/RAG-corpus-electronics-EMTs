Career in Electronics
One area of application for electric circuit analysis is electronics. The
term electronics was originally used to distinguish circuits of very low
current levels. This distinction no longer holds, as power semiconduc-
tor  devices  operate  at  high  levels  of  current.  Today,  electronics  is
regarded as the science of the motion of charges in a gas, vacuum, or
semiconductor.  Modern  electronics  involves  transistors  and  transistor
circuits.  The  earlier  electronic  circuits  were  assembled  from  compo-
nents. Many electronic circuits are now produced as integrated circuits,
fabricated in a semiconductor substrate or chip.
