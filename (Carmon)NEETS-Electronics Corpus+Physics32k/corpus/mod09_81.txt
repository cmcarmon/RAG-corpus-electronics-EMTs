Again, XL and XC are not equal. This time, XL is larger than XC. (If you don't know why, apply the 
formulas and review the past several pages.) The resultant reactance is 2000 ohms (XL − X C = 3770 − 
1770 = 2000 ohms.) Therefore, the resultant reactance (X), or the impedance of our perfect circuit at 300 
kHz, is 2000 ohms.
