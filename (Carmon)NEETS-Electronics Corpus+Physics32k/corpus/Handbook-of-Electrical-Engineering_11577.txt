Immediately following World War II, the U.S. government began the ﬁrst concerted effort to foster better
engineering design for artiﬁcial limbs. Dynamically lockable knee joints were designed for artiﬁcial limbs for
above-knee  amputees.  In  the  ensuing  years,  energy-storing  artiﬁcial  ankles  have  been  designed,  some  with
prosthetic feet so realistic that beach thongs could be worn with them. Artiﬁcial hands, wrists, and elbows were
designed for upper-limb amputees. Careful design of the actuating cable system also provided for a sense of
hand grip force, so that the user had some feedback and did not need to rely on vision alone for guidance.
