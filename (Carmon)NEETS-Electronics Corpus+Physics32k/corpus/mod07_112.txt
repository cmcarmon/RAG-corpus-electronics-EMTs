Still another process is to heat a section of semiconductor material to near melting and then diffuse
impurity atoms into a surface layer. Regardless of the process, the objective is to have a perfect bond
everywhere along the union (interface) between P and N materials. Proper contact along the union is
important because, as we will see later, the union (junction or interface) is the rectifying agent in the
diode.
