Result (23) also leads to some understanding of what happens when atomic-level effects are taken into account, and the band-structure is no longer free-electron like. Due to the presence of the atomic ion-cores, the surface barrier, and also the electron wave-functions at the surface, will be different. This will affect the values of the correction factor

, the prefactor P, and (to a limited extent) the correction factor λd. These changes will, in turn, affect the values of the parameter DF and (to a limited extent) the parameter dF. For a real metal, the supply density will vary with position in energy space, and the value at point "F" may be different from the Sommerfeld supply density. We can take account of this effect by introducing an electronic-band-structure correction factor λB into eq. (23). Modinos has discussed how this factor might be calculated: he estimates that it is most likely to be between 0.1 and 1; it might lie outside these limits but is most unlikely to lie outside the range 0.01<λB<10.
By defining an overall supply correction factor λZ equal to λT λB λd2, and combining equations above, we reach the so-called physically complete Fowler-Nordheim-type equation:

Within the more complete theory described here, the factor tF−2 is a component part of the correction factor λd2 [see, and note that λd2 is denoted by λD there]. There is no significant value in continuing the separate identification of tF−2. Probably, in the present state of knowledge, the best approximation for simple Fowler-Nordheim-type equation based modeling of CFE from metals is obtained by putting λZ→1, PF → 1,
