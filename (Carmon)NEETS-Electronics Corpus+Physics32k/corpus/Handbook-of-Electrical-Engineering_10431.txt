The C3 system necessarily has the ability to rapidly acquire, process, and transfer large volumes of data over
extended  regions.  Trained,  experienced  human  decisionmakers  excel  at  assessing  complex  patterns  in  highly
cluttered environments and determining appropriate responses. Decision aids perform as a “smart” interface
between  these  two  dissimilar  players.  Electronics  technology  provides  the  means  for  designing  increasingly
capable  C3  systems  and  is  at  its  most  effective  when  the  system  architecture  allows  ﬂexible  and  dynamic
interoperation of the various hardware “devices” with their trained and motivated decisionmakers.
