T A B L E A.1 Maxwell’s Equations
(for a vacuum). The ﬁfth equation is
the continuity equation implicit in
Maxwell’s Equations. It can be
derived by combining the time
derivative of the ﬁrst equation with
the divergence of the fourth
equation. E is the electric ﬁeld, B
the magnetic ﬂux density, ρ the
charge density (note that this ρ is
different from the resistivity used in
computing the resistance of an
element), J the current density, 0
the permittivity of free space, µ0
the magnetic permeability of free
space, E the electric ﬂux, and
B the magnetic ﬂux. E is
deﬁned as the area integral of E
and B as the area integral of B.
