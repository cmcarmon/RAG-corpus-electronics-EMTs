To determine the frequency response of a BIBO stable transfer
function matrix, G(s), let its input be the vector of complex
exponentials u(t ) ¼ uejvt , u 2 Cp;
steady-state
response is a complex exponential vector of the same fre-
quency with amplitudes and phases changed by G(s)js ¼ jv.
the steady-state response be given by yss(t ) ¼ ye jvt ,
Let
y 2 C p, then the complex vectors u and y are related by:
