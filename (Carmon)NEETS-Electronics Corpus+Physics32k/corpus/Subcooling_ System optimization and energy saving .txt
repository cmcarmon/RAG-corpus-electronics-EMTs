Besides this, allowing the subcooling process to occur outside the condenser (as with an internal heat exchanger) is a good way of using up all of the condensing device's heat exchanging capacity. A huge portion of refrigeration systems use part of the condenser for subcooling which, though very effective and simple, may be considered a diminishing factor in the nominal condensing capacity. A similar situation may be found with superheating taking place in the evaporator, thus, an internal heat exchanger is a good and relatively cheap solution for the maximization of heat exchanging capacity.
Finally, another widespread application of subcooling is boosting and economising. Inversely to superheating, subcooling, or the amount of heat withdrawn from the liquid refrigerant on the subcooling process, manifests itself as an increase on the refrigeration capacity of the system. This means that any extra heat removal after the condensation (subcooling) allows a higher ratio of heat absorption on further stages of the cycle. It is to be noted that superheating has exactly the inverse effect, and that an internal heat exchanger alone, is not able to increase the capacity of the system because the boosting effect of subcooling is dimmed by the superheating, making the net capacity gain equal to zero. Nevertheless, some systems are able to move refrigerant and/or to remove heat using up less energy because they do so on high pressure fluids that later cool or subcool lower pressure (which are more difficult to cool) fluids.
