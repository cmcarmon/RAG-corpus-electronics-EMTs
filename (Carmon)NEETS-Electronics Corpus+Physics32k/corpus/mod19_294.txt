NATIONAL STOCK NUMBERS (NSNs).Â—An NSN is a 13-digit stock number used to identify 
an item of material in the Federal Catalog System of the Department of Defense. It consists of a four-digit 
federal supply classification (FSC) and a nine-digit national item identification number (NIIN). The first 
two digits of the FSC denote the group or major division of materials and the last two digits denote the 
class of subdivision of material within a group.
