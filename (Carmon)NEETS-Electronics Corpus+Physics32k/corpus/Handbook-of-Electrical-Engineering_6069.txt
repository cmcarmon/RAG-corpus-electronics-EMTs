The problem of obtaining an accurate, load ﬂow solution, with a guaranteed and fast convergence has resulted
in more technical papers than any other analysis topic. This is understandable when it is realized that the load
ﬂow solution is required during the running of many other types of power system analyses. While improvements
have been made, there has been no major breakthrough in performance. It is doubtful if such an achievement
is possible as the time required to prepare the data and process the results represents a signiﬁcant part of the
overall time of the analysis.
