A decimal addition table is shown in table 1-1. The numbers in row X and column Y may represent
either the addend or the augend. If the numbers in X represent the augend, then the numbers in Y must
represent the addend and vice versa. The sum of X + Y is located at the point in array Z where the
selected X row and Y column intersect.
