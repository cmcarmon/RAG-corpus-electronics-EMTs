Good  temperature  stability  requires  capacitors  to  have  a  K  value  between  10  and  200.  If  high  Q  is  also
required, the capacitor will be physically larger. Ceramic capacitors with a zero temperature change are called
negative-positive-zero (NPO) and come in a capacitance range of 1.0 pF to 0.033 mF.
