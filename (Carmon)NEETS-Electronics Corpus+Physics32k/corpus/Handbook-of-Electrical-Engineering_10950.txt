Figure 113.3  illustrates  the  processes  that  support  the
propagation  of  an  action  potential.  Consider  that  point  A
on the axon is depolarized. The local depolarization causes
ionic  transfer  between  adjacent  points  on  the  axon,  thus
propagating the region of depolarization. If depolarization
were initiated from an external electrical source on a resting
membrane at point A, an action potential would propagate
in  both  directions  away  from  the  site  of  stimulation.  The
bodyâ€™s  natural  condition,  however,  is  to  initiate  an  action
potential at the terminus of the axon, which then propagates
in only one direction.
