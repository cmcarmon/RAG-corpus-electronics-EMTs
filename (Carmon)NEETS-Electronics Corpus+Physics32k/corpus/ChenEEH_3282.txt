For line lengths longer than 150 miles, the lumped param-
eter model may not provide sufﬁcient accuracy. To see this,
note that at 60 Hz for a low-loss line, the wavelength is around
3000 miles. Thus, a 150-mile line begins to cover a signiﬁcant
portion of the wave, and the well-known wave equations must
be used. The relationship between voltage and current at a
point x (i.e., distance along the line) to the receiving end
voltage, Vr , and current, Ir , is seen through the following
equations:
