The  distortion  level  places  a  restriction  on  the  amplitude  of  the  input  signal  that  can  be  applied  to  an
electronic system. Therefore, it is essential to characterize the distortion in a circuit. In this section different
types of distortion are deﬁned and techniques for distortion calculation are presented. These techniques are
applicable to simple circuit conﬁgurations. For larger circuits a circuit simulation program is invaluable.
