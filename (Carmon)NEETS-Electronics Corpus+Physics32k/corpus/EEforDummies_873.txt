Amassing a multimeter
One of the most important tools you’ll need is 
a multimeter, which you use to measure AC and 
DC voltages, resistance, and current when you 
want to explore what’s going on in a circuit. Most 
multimeters you find today are of the digital vari-
ety (see Figure 13-1), which just means they use 
numeric displays, like a digital clock or watch. 
(You can use them to explore analog as well as 
digital circuits.) An older‐style analog multime-
ter uses a needle to point to a set of graduated 
scales.
