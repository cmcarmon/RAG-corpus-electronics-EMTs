Many  early  hierarchical  ﬂoorplanning  tools  insist  that  the  ﬂoorplan  be  sliceable.  A  sliceable  ﬂoorplan  is
recursively deﬁned as follows: (a) a cell or (b) a ﬂoorplan that can be bipartitioned into two sliceable ﬂoorplans
with either a horizontal or vertical line. Figure 25.10 shows a sliceable ﬂoorplan whose tree is binary.
