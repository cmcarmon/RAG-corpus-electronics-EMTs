PLTs are studied for maneuvering spacecraft in near earth orbit, propellantless operation, thrust and power beaming for "perpetual" stationkeeping, and ultra-precision spacecraft formation flying, with or without tethers.
Norman and Peck analyzed a group of spacecraft that can exploit relative positions and velocities so that differential gravity provides a force opposite to the photon thrust from a PLT. In such a scheme, with two orbiting platforms moving in formation, when the photon thrust changes, their positions relative to the center of mass change as well, until the "virtual gravitational tug" counterbalances it again. Existing concepts with conventional thrusters are not persistent, are mechanically constrained (e.g. with tethers), or lie within the orbital plane, limiting their aperture for earth-observation missions. This system in contrast could control of out-of-plane motions. Figure 9 shows examples of "virtual tug" satellite formations for forming large synthetic apertures in Low Earth Orbit.

Similarly, small orbital craft that need to correct for orbital drag could do this with significantly less propellant, by moving a larger resource vehicle into a similar orbit with low inter-vehicle velocity. The replacement of such a resource vehicle could be faster and more economical.
