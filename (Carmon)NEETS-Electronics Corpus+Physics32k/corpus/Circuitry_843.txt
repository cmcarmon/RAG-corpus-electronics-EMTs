stripboard 
involve 
mounting  IC  sockets  first  followed  by  transistors, 
diodes,  resistors,  capacitors  and  other  passive 
components. Finally, terminal pins and links should 
be  fitted  before  making  the  track  breaks.  On 
completion, the board should be carefully checked, 
paying  particular  attention 
to  all  polarized 
components (e.g. diodes, transistors and electrolytic 
capacitors). Figure 19.7 shows a typical stripboard 
layout together with matching component overlay.
