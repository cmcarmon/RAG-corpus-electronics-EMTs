Crystals, because of their structure, have a natu-
ral frequency of vibration. If the AC signal applied 
matches the natural frequency, the crystal vibrates 
more. If the AC signal is different from the crystal’s 
natural frequency, little vibration is produced. The 
crystal’s mechanical frequency of vibration is constant, 
making it ideal for oscillator circuits.
