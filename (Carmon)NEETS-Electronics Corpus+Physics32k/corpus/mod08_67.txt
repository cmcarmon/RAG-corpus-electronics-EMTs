The class of operation of an amplifier is determined by the amount of time (in relation to the input 
signal) that current flows in the output circuit. This is a function of the operating point of the amplifying 
device. The operating point of the amplifying device is determined by the bias applied to the device. 
There are four classes of operation for an amplifier. These are: A, AB, B and C. Each class of operation 
has certain uses and characteristics. No one class of operation is "better" than any other class. The 
selection of the "best" class of operation is determined by the use of the amplifying circuit. The best class 
of operation for a phonograph is not the best class for a radio transmitter.
