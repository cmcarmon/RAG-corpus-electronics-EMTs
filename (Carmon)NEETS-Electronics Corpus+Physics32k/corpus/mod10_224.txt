The graph shown in figure 2-2 shows the relationship between the magnetic (H) field and the electric 
(E) field plotted against time. Note that the two fields are 90 degrees out of phase with each other. If you 
compare the graph in figure 2-2 with figure 2-1, you will notice that the two fields around the antenna are 
displaced 90 degrees from each other in space. (The H field exists in a plane perpendicular to the antenna. 
The E field exists in a plane parallel with the antenna, as shown in figure 2-1.)
