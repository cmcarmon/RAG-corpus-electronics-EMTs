In conductors, the outer electrons of each atom are bound so loosely that 
many of them break free and jump around from atom to atom. These free 
electrons are like sheep grazing on a hillside: They drift around aimlessly but 
donâ€™t move very far or in any particular direction. But if you give these free 
electrons a bit of a push in one direction, they will quickly get organized and 
move together in the direction of the push.
