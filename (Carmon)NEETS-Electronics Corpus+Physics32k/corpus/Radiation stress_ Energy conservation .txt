For an inviscid flow the mean mechanical energy of the total flow – that is the sum of the energy of the mean flow and the fluctuating motion – is conserved. However, the mean energy of the fluctuating motion itself is not conserved, nor is the energy of the mean flow. The mean energy E of the fluctuating motion (the sum of the kinetic and potential energies satisfies:

where ":" denotes the double-dot product, and ε denotes the dissipation of mean mechanical energy (for instance by wave breaking). The term

{\displaystyle \mathbf {S} :\left(\nabla \otimes {\overline {\boldsymbol {u}}}\right)}
is the exchange of energy with the mean motion, due to wave–current interaction. The mean horizontal wave-energy transport (u + cg) E consists of two contributions:
u E : the transport of wave energy by the mean flow, and
cg E : the mean energy transport by the waves themselves, with the group velocity cg as the wave-energy transport velocity.
In a Cartesian coordinate system, the above equation for the mean energy E of the flow fluctuations becomes:

So the radiation stress changes the wave energy E only in case of a spatial-inhomogeneous current field (ux,uy).
