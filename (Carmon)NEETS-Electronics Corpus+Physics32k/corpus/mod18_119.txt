A conical scan can be generated by nutation of the waveguide. In this process the axis of the
waveguide itself is moved through a small conical pattern. In an actual installation of a nutating
waveguide, the three-dimensional movement is fast and of small amplitude. To an observer, the
waveguide appears merely to be vibrating slightly.
