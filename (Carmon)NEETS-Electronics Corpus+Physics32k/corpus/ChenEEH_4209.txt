With these deﬁciencies, we need a data link layer above
the MAC protocol
to make up these deﬁciencies. Each
frame carries the source and destination address in a local
network, and all stations on the network will receive the
frame through the shared transmission medium. Therefore,
a routing function of the network layer within a local net-
work is not required. Figure 6.3 depicts the local network
architecture.
