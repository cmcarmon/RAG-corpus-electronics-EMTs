An intuitive grasp of op amps in feedback can be found by examining the voltage 
follower  circuit  shown  in  Figure  8.2.  The  input  voltage  is  applied  at  the  plus  terminal 
while the output voltage is fed back into the minus terminal. The voltage follower will 
replicate  the  input  voltage  at  its  output  while  isolating  disturbances  at  the  output  from 
affecting the input.
