In the previous section, we formulated the power ï¬‚ow
problem as a set of simultaneous nonlinear equations of 7.42
and as such, it is not obvious how the Gauss-Seidel algorithm
can be applied for solving these equations. The trick here is to
visualize the power balance equations to be arising from the
