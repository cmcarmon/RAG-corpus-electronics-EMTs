Operational amplifier parameters 
 
Before we take a look at some of the characteristics 
of  ‘ideal’  and  ‘real’  operational  amplifiers  it  is 
important 
terms  and 
parameters that we apply to these devices. 
 
Open-loop voltage gain 
 
The  open-loop  voltage  gain  of  an  operational 
amplifier is defined as the ratio of output voltage to 
input  voltage  measured  with  no  feedback  applied. 
In  practice, 
is  exceptionally  high 
(typically  greater  than  100,000)  but  is  liable  to 
considerable variation from one device to another.  
  Open-loop  voltage  gain  may  thus  be  thought  of 
as the ‘internal’ voltage gain of the device, thus:
