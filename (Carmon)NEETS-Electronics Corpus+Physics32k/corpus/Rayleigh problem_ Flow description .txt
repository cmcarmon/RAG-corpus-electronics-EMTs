Consider an infinitely long plate which suddenly made to move with constant velocity



U


{\displaystyle U}
in the



x


{\displaystyle x}
direction, which is located at



y
=
0


{\displaystyle y=0}
in an infinite domain of fluid, which is at rest initially everywhere. The incompressible Navier-Stokes equations reduce to







∂
u


∂
t



=
ν




∂

2


u


∂

y

2







{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial u}{\partial t}}=\nu {\frac {\partial ^{2}u}{\partial y^{2}}}}

where



ν


{\displaystyle \nu }
is the kinematic viscosity. The initial and the no-slip condition on the wall are




u
(
y
,
0
)
=
0
,

u
(
0
,
t
>
0
)
=
U
,

u
(
∞
,
t
>
0
)
=
0
,


{\displaystyle u(y,0)=0,\quad u(0,t>0)=U,\quad u(\infty ,t>0)=0,}

the last condition is due to the fact that the motion at



y
=
0


{\displaystyle y=0}
is not felt at infinity. The flow is only due to the motion of the plate, there is no imposed pressure gradient.
