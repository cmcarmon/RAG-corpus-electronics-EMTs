��
(�º . With �equal to 30º , the ratio of the length of side B to side C is
0.866 to 1. That is, if the hypotenuse is 1 inch long, the side adjacent to , side B, is 0.866 inch long.
Also, with �equal to 30º , the ratio of side A to side C is 0.5 to 1. That is, with the hypotenuse 1 inch
long, the side opposite to � (side A) is 0.5 inch long. With  still at 30º , side A is 0.5774 of the length of
B. With the combination of angles given (30º -60º -90º ) these are the ONLY ratios of lengths that will
"fit" to form a right triangle.
