A trajectory or flight path is the path that a moving object follows through space as a function of time. The object might be a projectile or a satellite. For example, it can be an orbit—the path of a planet, an asteroid, or a comet as it travels around a central mass. A trajectory can be described mathematically either by the geometry of the path or as the position of the object over time.

In control theory a trajectory is a time-ordered set of states of a dynamical system (see e.g. Poincaré map). In discrete mathematics, a trajectory is a sequence
