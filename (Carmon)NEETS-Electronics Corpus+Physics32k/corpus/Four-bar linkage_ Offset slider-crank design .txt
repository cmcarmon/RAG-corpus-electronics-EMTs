With an offset slider-crank mechanism, an offset distance is introduced. This offset distance is referred to as L1 and is the fixed distance between the crank arm pivot point and the slider axis. This offset distance means that the slider-crank motion is no longer symmetrical about the sliding axis. In addition, the required crank angles of the forward and reverse strokes are no longer equivalent. An offset slider-crank provides a quick return when a slower working stroke is desired.
With offset slider-cranks, the stroke is always twice the crank length, and as the offset distance increases, the stroke also becomes larger. The potential range for the offset distance can be written in relation to the other mechanism lengths, L2and L3, as the equation:
L1 < L3 - L2
The design of an offset slider-crank mechanism involves finding the two link lengths, L2 and L3, and an appropriate offset distance, L1, in order to achieve the wanted stroke, (ΔR4)max, and imbalance angle, β.
