Comparing the adjustments used by the algorithms described
by equations 2.62 through 2.65 and illustrated by Figure 2.19,
with the piecewise-constant weight function used by the WLS
method, it is possible to derive a very simple approach for
designing digital ﬁlters with some compromises on minimax
and WLS constraints (Diniz and Netto, 1999). This approach
consists of a modiﬁcation on the weight-function updating
procedure in such way that it becomes constant after a par-
ticular extreme of the stopband of Bk(v):
