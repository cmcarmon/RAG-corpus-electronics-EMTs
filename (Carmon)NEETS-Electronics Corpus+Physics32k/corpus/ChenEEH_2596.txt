Planar resonators are known to suffer from high ohmic
losses, in particular at high frequency, which excludes them
from the construction of high-performance, narrow band
ﬁlters. Usually,
they are limited to the lower microwave
domain (up to 15 GHz) and only if insertion loss and slope-
selectivity is not a major concern. Some Q-enhanced planar
ﬁlters are possible in conjunction with strip line and suspended
microstrip structures (up to 30 GHz). In the higher microwave
domain and well into the millimeter wave region, waveguide
ﬁlters are most commonly used. With the emergence of com-
mercial broadband systems in the millimeter-wave range,
quasiplanar ﬁlters have made a comeback. Coaxial line and
dielectric resonator ﬁlters are most frequently used in the
lower microwave range if high Q values or small size are
needed. In addition, low-loss and lightweight dielectric ﬁlters
are constructed for millimeter-wave applications.
