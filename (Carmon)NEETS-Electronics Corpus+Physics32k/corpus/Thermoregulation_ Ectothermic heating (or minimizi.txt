Convection:
Climbing to higher ground up trees, ridges, rocks.
Entering a warm water or air current.
Building an insulated nest or burrow.

Conduction:
Lying on a hot surface.

Radiation:
Lying in the sun (heating this way is affected by the body's angle in relation to the sun).
Folding skin to reduce exposure.
Concealing wing surfaces.
Exposing wing surfaces.

Insulation:
Changing shape to alter surface/volume ratio.
Inflating the body.

To cope with low temperatures, some fish have developed the ability to remain functional even when the water temperature is below freezing; some use natural antifreeze or antifreeze proteins to resist ice crystal formation in their tissues. Amphibians and reptiles cope with heat loss by evaporative cooling and behavioral adaptations. An example of behavioral adaptation is that of a lizard lying in the sun on a hot rock in order to heat through conduction.
