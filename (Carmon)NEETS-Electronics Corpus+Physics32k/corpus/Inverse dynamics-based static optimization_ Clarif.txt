Muscle contraction can be eccentric (velocity of contraction



v
<
0


{\displaystyle v<0}
), concentric (



v
>
0


{\displaystyle v>0}
) or isometric (



v
=
0


{\displaystyle v=0}
). From muscle force-velocity characteristic we notice that muscle force in an eccentric contraction is higher than the maximum isometric force, why then do we use it as a constraint on muscle force? Mainly for two reasons:
Rarely do muscle contraction occur with total activation (



a
=
1


{\displaystyle a=1}
), then eccentric contraction force is lowered proportionally to the value of activation;
The maximum isometric force is a remarkable and fixed value of force given the physiological cross-sectional area of a muscle (they are linked by the concept of specific tension of a muslce).
