Based on Rughâ€™s results (1981) using Volterra series to represent
nonlinear systems, Al-Baiyat and Sain (1986, 1989) applied the
use of Volterra operators to nonlinear regulator design in
the context of the total synthesis problem (TSP) in 1986.
Since then, Sain et al. (1990, 1991) have used the TSP frame-
work to apply Volterra operators in nonlinear servomechanism
design, and in 1995, Doyle et al. (1995) cast the method into a
model-predictive control design. Al-Baiyat showed that the
Volterra operators comprising the controller can be realized
as interconnections of linear systems, and Sain (1997) derived
an equivalent reduced-order realization. For brevity, a partial
linearization regulator design (Sain et al., 1997b) is presented
herein. The approach extends to servomechanisms, and the
general controller design is given by Sain (1997).
