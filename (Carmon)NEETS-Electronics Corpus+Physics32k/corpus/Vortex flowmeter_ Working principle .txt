When the medium flows through the triangular cylinder at a certain speed,an alternately arranged vortex belt is generated behind the sides of the triangular cylinder,called the"Carmen vortex".Since both sides of the vortex generator alternately generate the vortex,the pressure pulsation is generated on both sides of the generator,which makes the detector produce alternating stress.The piezoelectric element encapsulated in the detection probe body generates an alternating charge signal with the same frequency as the vortex,under the action of alternating stress.The signal is sent to the intelligent flow totalizer to be processed after being amplified by the pre-amplifier,realizing displaying instantaneous flow and cumulative flow of fluid,communicating and controlling of flow data and the microcomputer system.
In certain range of Reynolds number(2×10^4~7×10^6),the relationship among vortex releasing frequency f,fluid velocity V and vortex generator facing flow surface width d can be expressed by the following equation:

f=Sr×V/d   V=f×d/Sr

In the equation,f-releasing frequency of Carmen vortex,Sr -coefficient(called the Strauss number),V-velocity, d-width of the triangular cylinder.
