The March equinox is one point in time commonly used to determine the length of the tropical year. The mean tropical year is the average of all the tropical years measured from every point along the Earth's orbit. When tropical year measurements from several successive years are compared, many slight variations are found which are due to a variety of phenomena, including nutation and the planetary perturbations from the Sun. The following table shows the small variations in timing over a long period of time; the mean Tropical year lasts 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes, 45 seconds.
