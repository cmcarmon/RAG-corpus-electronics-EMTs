One Ô¨Ånal note: for most practical purposes, wire conductors can be assumed to possess zero
resistance from end to end. In reality, however, there will always be some small amount of
resistance encountered along the length of a wire, unless its a superconducting wire. Knowing
this, we need to bear in mind that the principles learned here about electrically common points
are all valid to a large degree, but not to an absolute degree. That is, the rule that electrically
common points are guaranteed to have zero voltage between them is more accurately stated
as such: electrically common points will have very little voltage dropped between them. That
small, virtually unavoidable trace of resistance found in any piece of connecting wire is bound
