In 1969, Stewart Miller of AT&T Bell Laboratories published his landmark article on integrated optics. This
article  laid  the  foundation  for  what  has  now  developed  into  optoelectronic  circuits.  In  it  he  described  the
concepts of planar optical guided-wave devices formed as thin ﬁlms on various substrates using fabrication
techniques similar to those used in the semiconductor integrated circuit (IC) industry. The attributes of these
new circuits included small size, weight, power consumption, and mechanical robustness because all compo-
nents were integrated on a single substrate. The ﬁeld of optoelectronic circuits began as a hybrid implementation
where optical sources (laser diodes) and detectors have historically been fabricated on separate semiconductor
substrates,  and  waveguide  devices,  such  as  modulators  and  switches,  have  been  fabricated  on  electro-optic
single-crystal oxides such as lithium niobate (LiNbO3). Often, the two dissimilar substrates have been connected
using single-mode polarization preserving optical ﬁber. Now, although the hybrid concept is ﬁnding commercial
applications, most active research is performed on monolithic implementations, where all devices are fabricated
on a common semiconductor substrate. After a brief summary discussion of semiconductor, glass, and polymer
material systems, we will deal exclusively with the most mature hybrid implementation of optoelectronic circuits
based on LiNbO3.
