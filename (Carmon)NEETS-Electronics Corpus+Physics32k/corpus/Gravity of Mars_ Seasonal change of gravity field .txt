The sublimation-condensation cycle of carbon dioxide on Mars between the atmosphere and cryosphere (polar ice cap) operates seasonally. This cycle contributes as almost the only variable accounting for changes in gravity field on Mars. The measured gravitational potential of Mars from orbiters could be generalized as the equation below,

{\displaystyle V(Mars)=V({Solid\,planet})+V(Seasonal\,caps+Atmosphere)}

In turn, when there is more mass in the seasonal caps due to the more condensation of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, the mass of the atmosphere would drop. They have inverse relationship with each other. And the change in mass has direct effect towards the measured gravitational potential.
The seasonal mass exchange between the northern polar cap and southern polar cap exhibits long-wavelength gravity variation with time. Long years of continuous observation has found that the determination of even zonal, normalized gravity coefficient Cl=2, m=0, and odd zonal, normalized gravity coefficient Cl=3, m=0 are crucial for outlining the time-variable gravity due to such mass exchange,  where

If we regard the two poles as two distinct point masses, then, their masses are defined as,

Data has indicated that the maximum mass variation of the southern polar cap is approximately 8.4 x 1015 kg, occurring near the autumnal equinox, while for that of the northern polar is approximately 6.2 x 1015 kg, occurring in between the winter solstice and spring equinox.
In long term speaking, it has been found that the mass of ice stored in North Pole would increase by (1.4 + 0.5) x 1011 kg, while in South Pole it would decrease by (0.8 + 0.6) x 1011 kg. In addition, the atmosphere would have decrease in term of the mass of carbon dioxide by (0.6 + 0.6) x 1011 kg in long term as well. Due to existence of uncertainties, it is unclear whether migration of material from the South Pole to the North Pole is ongoing, though such a possibility cannot be ruled out.
