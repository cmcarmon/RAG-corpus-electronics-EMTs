In mobile cellular communication systems, LPC speech compression is only needed for
the radio transmission between the mobile transcriber and the base station in any cell. At the
base station interface, the LPC-encoded speech is converted to analog form and resampled and
digitized (by using PCM) for transmission over the terrestrial telephone system. Thus, a speech
