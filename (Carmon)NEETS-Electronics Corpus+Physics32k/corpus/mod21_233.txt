Any linear (analog) IC is sensitive to its supply voltage. This is especially the case among ICs that
use bias and control voltages in addition to a supply voltage. If you suspect a linear IC of being defective,
all voltages coming to the IC must be checked against the manufacturer’s circuit diagram of the
equipment for any special notes on voltages. The manufacturer’s handbook will also give you
recommended voltages for any particular IC.
