End users perform fiber geometry measurements to reduce system attenuation and coupling loss
resulting from poor fiber fabrication. Fiber attenuation and intrinsic coupling loss result from mismatches
in the inherent fiber characteristics of two connecting fibers. Fiber mismatches occur when manufacturers
fail to maintain optical or structural (geometrical) tolerances during the fiber fabrication process. Fiber
geometry measurements performed in the laboratory identify fiber mismatches before the optical fiber is
installed.
