During reception, as shown in figure 2-16, the amplitude of the received echo is not sufficient to
cause an arc across either spark gap. Under this condition, the atr circuit now acts as a half-wave
transmission line terminated in a short-circuit. This is reflected as an open circuit at the receiver
T-junction, three-quarter wavelengths away. The received echo sees an open circuit in the direction of the
transmitter. However, the receiver input impedance is matched to the transmission line impedance so that
the entire received signal will go to the receiver with a minimum amount of loss.
