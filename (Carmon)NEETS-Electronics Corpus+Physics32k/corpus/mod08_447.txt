load flux from the two load coils cancels and has no effect on the control flux. During the second half
cycle, the diode does not conduct and the load coils develop no flux, as shown in view (B). The load flux
never has to reverse direction as it did in the saturable-core reactor, so the hysteresis loss is eliminated.
