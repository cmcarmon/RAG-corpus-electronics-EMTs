The importance of Lee’s algorithm is that it always ﬁnds the shortest path between two points. Since it routes
one net at a time, however, there is a possibility of having some nets unrouted at the end of the routing process.
The other weak points of this technique are the requirements of a large memory space and long execution time.
For this reason, the maze router is often used as a side router for the routing of critical nets and/or routing of
leftover unrouted nets.
