Recording Technique
Both  bipolar  [Fig.  113.19(A)]  and  monopolar  [Fig.
113.19(B)] techniques are used. With monopolar record-
ing, one side of each ampliﬁer is connected to a reference
electrode, usually on the earlobe. With bipolar recording,
the ampliﬁers are connected between pairs of scalp elec-
trodes in a regular order. With both types of recording,
one-half  the  number  of  channels  is  connected  to  elec-
trodes on the opposite side of the head. In this way, the
electrical activity from homologous areas of the brain can
be compared at a glance.
