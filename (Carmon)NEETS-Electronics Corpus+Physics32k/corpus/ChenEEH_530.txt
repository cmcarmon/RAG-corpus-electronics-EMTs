where vn max is the maximum electron drift velocity. Then the
scattering process occurs, and the electron loses all the excess
energy and all the drift velocity. Hence, the electron drift
velocity varies between zero and vn max, and average electron
drift velocity (vn ¼ vn max=2) becomes nearly independent of
the electric ﬁeld:
