Acoustic theory is a scientific field that relates to the description of sound waves. It derives from fluid dynamics. See acoustics for the engineering approach.
Propagation of sound waves in a fluid (such as water) can be modeled by an equation of continuity (conservation of mass) and an equation of motion (conservation of momentum) . With some simplifications, in particular constant density, they can be given as follows:

where



p

{\displaystyle p(\mathbf {x} ,t)}
is the acoustic pressure and




u

(

{\displaystyle \mathbf {u} (\mathbf {x} ,t)}
is the flow velocity vector,

{\displaystyle \mathbf {x} }
is the vector of spatial coordinates

t


{\displaystyle t}
is the time,




ρ

{\displaystyle \rho _{0}}
is the static mass density of the medium and



κ


{\displaystyle \kappa }
is the bulk modulus of the medium. The bulk modulus can be expressed in terms of the density and the speed of sound in the medium (

If the flow velocity field is irrotational,

{\displaystyle \nabla \times \mathbf {u} =\mathbf {0} }
