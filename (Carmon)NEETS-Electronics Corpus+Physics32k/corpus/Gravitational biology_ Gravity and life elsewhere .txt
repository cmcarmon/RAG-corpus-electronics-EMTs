Every day the realization of space habitation becomes closer, and even today space stations exist and are home to long-term, though not yet permanent, residents. Because of this there is a growing scientific interest in how changes in the gravitational field influence different aspects of the physiology of living organisms, especially mammals since these results can normally be closely related to the expected effects on humans. All current research in this field can be classified into two groups.
The first group consists of the experiments that involve gravitational fields of less than one g, termed hypogravity, without artificial gravity, or microgravity. A space station or a spacecraft in a spaceflight will be in hypogravity. Therefore, understanding of the effects of hypogravity on the human body is necessary for prolonged space travel and colonization.
The second group consist of those involving gravitational fields of more than one g, termed hypergravity. For brief periods during take-off and landing of space craft astronauts are under the influence of hypergravity. Understanding the effects of hypergravity are also necessary if colonization of planets larger than the Earth is ever to take place.
