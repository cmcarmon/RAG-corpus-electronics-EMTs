The theory of graphs has played a fundamental role in dis-
covering structural properties of electrical circuits. This should
not be surprising because graphs, as the reader shall soon see,
are good pictorial representations of circuits and capture all
their structural characteristics. This chapter develops most
results that form the foundation of graph theoretic study of
electrical circuits. A comprehensive treatment of these devel-
opments may be found in Swamy and Thulasiraman (1981).
All theorems in this chapter are stated without proofs.
