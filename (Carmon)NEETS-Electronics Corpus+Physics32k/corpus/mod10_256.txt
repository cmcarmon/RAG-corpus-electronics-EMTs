When radio waves are reflected from flat surfaces, a phase shift in the alternations of the wave 
occurs. Figure 2-7 shows two radio waves being reflected from the Earth's surface. Notice that the 
positive and negative alternations of radio waves (A) and (B) are in phase with each other in their paths 
toward the Earth's surface. After reflection takes place, however, the waves are approximately 180 
degrees out of phase from their initial relationship. The amount of phase shift that occurs is not constant.
