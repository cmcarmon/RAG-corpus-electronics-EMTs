The operation of the Armstrong oscillator is basically this: Power applied to the transistor allows 
energy to be applied to the tank circuit causing it to oscillate. Once every cycle, the transistor conducts for 
a short period of time (class C operation) and returns enough energy to the tank to ensure a constant 
amplitude output signal.
