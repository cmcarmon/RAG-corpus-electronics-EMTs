(7.4.12)
where VA and IDSS are positive constants, and the factor (1 + vDS /VA) is added to account
approximately for the nonzero slope of the iDâ€“vDS curves of a practical device, as was done in
Equation (7.4.2). The small-signal equivalent circuit for low frequencies is of the same form as
Figure 7.4.4 for a JFET.
