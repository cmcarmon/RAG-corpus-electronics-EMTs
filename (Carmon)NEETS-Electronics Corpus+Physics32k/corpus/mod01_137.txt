To further describe and work with magnet phenomena, lines are used to represent the force existing
in the area surrounding a magnet (refer to fig. 1-14). These lines, called MAGNETIC LINES OF FORCE,
do not actually exist but are imaginary lines used to illustrate and describe the pattern of the magnetic
field. The magnetic lines of force are assumed to emanate from the north pole of a magnet, pass through
surrounding space, and enter the south pole. The lines of force then travel inside the magnet from the
south pole to the north pole, thus completing a closed loop.
