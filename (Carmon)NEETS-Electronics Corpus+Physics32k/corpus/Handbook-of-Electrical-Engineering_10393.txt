C3 system complexity arises primarily from the magnitude and mobility of the forces involved; forces that
can be composed of up to thousands of mobile platforms and hundreds of thousands of personnel. To this is
added  the  large  amount  of  uncertainty  present;  uncertainty  borne  of  the  adversary,  of  human  attributes,
dynamics,  hostile  environments,  and  communications.  Hundreds  of  radio  frequency  channels  may  be  in
simultaneous use supporting command, surveillance, intelligence, personnel, and logistics functions.
