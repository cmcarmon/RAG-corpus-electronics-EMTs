Serial Nonimpact Printer Technologies
Ink-jet and thermal printers represent the two major classes of serial nonimpact technologies used for personal
and workstation computer printer output. As shown in Table 89.7, the ink-jet technologies can be subclassiÔ¨Åed
as continuous, piezoelectric, and thermal/bubble-jet. The thermal technologies can be subdivided into direct
thermal, thermal transfer, and resistive ribbon.
