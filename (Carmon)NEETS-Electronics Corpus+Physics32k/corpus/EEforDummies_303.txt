The combined resistance will always be greater than any individual resis­
tances. This fact comes in handy when you’re designing circuits. For example, 
if you want to limit current going into a light bulb but don’t know the resis­
tance of the bulb, you can place a resistor in series with the bulb and be secure 
in the knowledge that the total resistance to current flow is at least as much 
as the value of the resistor you added. For circuits that use variable resistors 
(such as a light‐dimmer circuit), putting a fixed resistor in series with the vari­
able resistor guarantees that the current will be limited even if the pot is dialed 
down to zero ohms. (The lowdown on how to calculate just what the current 
will be for a given voltage/resistance combo appears later in this chapter.)
