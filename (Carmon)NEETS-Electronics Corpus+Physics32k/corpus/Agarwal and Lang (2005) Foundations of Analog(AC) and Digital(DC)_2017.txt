and we expect the frequency response to look substantially different from those
we have seen thus far. The rest of this section will focus on the frequency
response of system functions with complex roots. This discussion will expand
the repertoire of system functions we have seen thus far, which included both
first- and second-order system functions with real roots (Chapter 13).
