The  transducer  signal  modulates  the  frequency  of  the  subcarrier  oscillator.  This  is  simply  a  resonant  circuit
that produces a given frequency in the audio range, say 100 Hz, and is varied plus or minus this center frequency
by the signal from the transducer as it responds to the variable that it is measuring. When the signal is fed to
a loudspeaker, one actually hears a rising or falling tone. The subcarrier oscillator modulates a radio frequency
carrier,  varying  its  frequency  in  accordance  with  the  subcarrier  voltage  signal.  The  radio  frequency  in  FM
industrial radio telemetry links is usually in the 88- to 108-MHz band, permitting the use of high-grade radio
tuners already mass produced for the high-Ô¨Ådelity market. The radio receiver demodulates the signal, removing
the carrier and feeding it to a special discriminator circuit that removes the double modulation and reproduces
an analog of the original measurement signal for calibrated indication or recording.
