Lawrence Stamper Darken has shown that the Gibbs-Duhem equation can be applied to the determination of chemical potentials of components from a multicomponent system from experimental data regarding the chemical potential

The derivative with respect to one mole fraction x2 is taken at constant ratios of amounts (and therefore of mole fractions) of the other components of the solution representable in a diagram like ternary plot.
The last equality can be integrated from
