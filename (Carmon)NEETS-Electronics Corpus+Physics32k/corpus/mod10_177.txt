The electric and magnetic fields radiated from an antenna form the electromagnetic field. This field
is responsible for the transmission and reception of electromagnetic energy through free space. An
antenna, however, is also part of the electrical circuit of a transmitter or a receiver and is equivalent to a
circuit containing inductance, capacitance, and resistance. Therefore, the antenna can be expected to
display definite voltage and current relationships with respect to a given input. A current through the
antenna produces a magnetic field, and a charge on the antenna produces an electric field. These two
fields combine to form the INDUCTION field. To help you gain a better understanding of antenna theory,
we must review some basic electrical concepts. We will review voltage and its electric field, current and
its magnetic field, and their relationship to propagation of electrical energy.
