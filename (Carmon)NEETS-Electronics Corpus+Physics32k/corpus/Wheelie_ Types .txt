Types of wheelie can be divided into two broad categories:
1. wheelies in which the vehicle power is sufficient by itself, as described in the Physics section below. These include:
Clutch wheelies: performed by disengaging the clutch and opening the throttle to let the engine race and then engaging the clutch abruptly.
Power wheelies or roll-on wheelies: performed by simply opening the throttle. If the engine has sufficient power, it will be able to lift the front wheel.

2. wheelies performed with the aid of suspension dynamics or rider motion. These include:
Bounce wheelies or slap wheelies: performed by opening and closing the throttle in time with suspension rebounding, tire rebounding, rider motion, or any combination of the three.
Manuals: performed without applying torque to the rear wheel at all, but instead by moving the rider's body backwards relative to the bike, and then pulling back on the handlebars near the end of available travel.
