The type of cut also determines the activity of the crystal. Some crystals vibrate at more than one 
frequency and thus will operate at harmonic frequencies. Crystals which are not of uniform thickness may 
have two or more resonant frequencies. Usually one resonant frequency is more pronounced than the 
others. The other less pronounced resonant frequencies are referred to as SPURIOUS frequencies. 
Sometimes such a crystal oscillates at two frequencies at the same time.
