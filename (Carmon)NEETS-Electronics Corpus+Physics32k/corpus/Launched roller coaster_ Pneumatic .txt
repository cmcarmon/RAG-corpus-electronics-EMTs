Using the same type of system as a Hydraulic launch, a pneumatic launch uses compressed air to launch the vehicle. The technology was developed by S&S as the Thrust Air 2000 model. The first coaster of this type was the Hypersonic XLC, opened at Kings Dominion in Doswell, Virginia, USA in 2001. This coaster closed in 2007. Another incarnation, the Ring Racer was open for only 3 days. The only operating coaster of this type is Do-Dodonpa, located at Fuji-Q Highland in Japan. Compressed air launches are able to provide more acceleration than traditional pneumatic launches, with Do-Dodonpa holding the acceleration record since it opened as Dodonpa in 2001, launching passengers from 0 to 112 mph (180 km/h) in 1.56 seconds.
