As previously noted, values of the external resistance, for a variety of coolants and heat transfer mechanisms,
are shown in Fig. 33.3 for a typical component wetted area of 10 cm2 and a velocity range of 2 m/s to 8 m/s.
Clearly, larger chip packages will experience proportionately lower external resistances than the tabulated values,
and  conduction  of  heat  through  the  leads  and  package  base  into  the  printed  circuit  board  or  substrate  will
serve to further reduce the effective thermal resistance.
