apertures of various sizes. This far-field power distribution data is transformed into the near-field before
using complex mathematical procedures. The mode field diameter is calculated from the transformed near
field data. The mathematics behind the transformation between the far-field and near-field is too
complicated for discussion in this chapter. Refer to EIA/TIA-455-167 for information on this
transformation procedure.
