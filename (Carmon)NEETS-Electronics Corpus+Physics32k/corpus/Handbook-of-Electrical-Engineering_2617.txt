There are two more complications in Ô¨Ånding the threshold voltage. First, the gate voltage VTH usually differs
from the gate potential FTH at threshold because of a work-function difference between the body and the gate
material.  This  difference  causes  a  spontaneous  charge  exchange  between  the  two  materials  as  soon  as  the
MOSFET is placed in a circuit allowing charge transfer to occur. Thus, even before any voltage is applied to the
device,  a  potential  difference  exists  between  the  gate  and  the  body  due  to  spontaneous  charge  transfer.  The
