The Op Amp exits the active region and enters the saturation region when
the external inputs are such that the Op Amp output is required to go above
+12 or below −12 V. As an example, suppose the Op Amp has power supply
voltages of +12 and −12, then if two volts are applied as the input to a non-
inverting Op Amp amplifier circuit with a gain of 10, the Op Amp will be driven
into positive saturation. Similarly, if minus two volts are applied to the same
amplifier, the Op Amp will be driven into negative saturation.
