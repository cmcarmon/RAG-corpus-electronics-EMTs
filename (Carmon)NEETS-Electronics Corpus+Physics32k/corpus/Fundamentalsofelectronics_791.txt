nication system. Assume that the channel introduces an attenuation α and white noise of spectral height
N0
. The ﬁlter does not aﬀect the signal component—we assume its gain is unity—but does ﬁlter the

noise, removing frequency components above W Hz. In the ﬁlter’s output, the received signal power equals
α2G2power (m) and the noise power N0W , which gives a signal-to-noise ratio of
