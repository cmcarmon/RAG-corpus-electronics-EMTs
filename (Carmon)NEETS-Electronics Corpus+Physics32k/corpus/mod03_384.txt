Circuit breakers are classified as being trip free or nontrip free. A trip-free circuit breaker is a circuit
breaker that will trip (open) even if the operating mechanism (ON-OFF switch) is held in the ON
position. A nontrip-free circuit breaker can be reset and/or held ON even if an overload or excessive heat
condition is present. In other words, a nontrip-free circuit breaker can be bypassed by holding the
operating mechanism ON.
