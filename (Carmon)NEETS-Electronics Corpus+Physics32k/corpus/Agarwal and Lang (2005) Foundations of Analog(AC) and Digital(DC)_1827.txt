(cid:1) The zero-input response of under-damped second-order systems resemble
sinusoids with amplitudes that decay with time. As an example, the ZIR
for an under-damped parallel resonant circuit, with Vo as the initial voltage
on the capacitor and zero initial current through the inductor, is given by
