With exactly 10 volts applied between the meter test leads (from some battery or precision
power supply), there will be exactly 1 mA of current through the meter movement, as restricted
by the ”multiplier” resistor and the movement’s own internal resistance. Exactly 1/2 volt will
be dropped across the resistance of the movement’s wire coil, and the needle will be pointing
precisely at full-scale. Having re-labeled the scale to read from 0 to 10 V (instead of 0 to 1 mA),
anyone viewing the scale will interpret its indication as ten volts. Please take note that the
