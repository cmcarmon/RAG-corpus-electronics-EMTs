Energy expenditure is commonly used as a measure of gait quality and efficiency. Human metabolic rates are usually recorded via measuring the maximal oxygen consumption (VO2 max) during controlled incremental exercise under observation. Treadmills are used for gait analysis and standard walking tests. Able-bodied and athletic individuals on average have smaller metabolic costs than impaired individuals performing identical tasks.
The values from a theoretical model and experimental analyses are listed below:
Transtibial amputees experience 9-33% increase
Transfemoral amputees experience 66-100% increase
Another source compiled a list of average metabolic cost increases categorized by amputation location and by cause of amputation:
Transtibial (traumatic) amputees experience 25% increase
Transtibial (vascular) amputees experience 40% increase
Transfemoral (traumatic) amputees experience 68% increase
Transfemoral (vascular) amputees experience 100% increase
