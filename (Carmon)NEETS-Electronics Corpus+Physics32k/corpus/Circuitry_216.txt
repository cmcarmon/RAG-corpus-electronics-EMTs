Example 4.16 
 
A transformer  has  1,200  primary  turns  and  is 
designed to operate with a 200 V a.c. supply. If the 
transformer  is  required  to  produce  an  output  of  
10  V,  determine  the  number  of  secondary  turns 
required.  Assuming  that  the  transformer  is  loss-
free,  determine  the  input  (primary)  current  for  a 
load current of 2.5 A.
