14.2.1 is given by x(t) = 8 cos 2π3000t + 4
cos 2π7000t. The frequency of the carrier wave
is 6 kHz. Sketch the amplitude line spectrum of
the modulated wave xc(t).
*14.2.3 Consider the following system with x(t)= 12 cos
2π100t + 4 cos 2π300t and two ideal ﬁlters as
shown in Figure P14.2.3. Find xa(t) and xb(t).
