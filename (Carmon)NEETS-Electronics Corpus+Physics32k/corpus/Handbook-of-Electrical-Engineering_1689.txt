The best concise introduction to Kalman ﬁltering is Chapter 12 in Bryson and Ho [1969]. The three best books
on  Kalman  ﬁlters  are  Gelb  [1974],  Sorenson  [1985],  and  Brown  et  al.  [1997].  The  standard  reference  on
nonlinear ﬁlters is Jazwinski [1970]. The best journal on Kalman ﬁlter applications is the IEEE Transactions on
Aerospace and Electronic Systems, which typically has several practical papers on Kalman ﬁlters each issue. Two
good conferences with many papers on Kalman ﬁlters are the IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (mid-
December annually) and the SPIE Conference on Signal and Data Processing (April each year).
