Semiconductor sources are diodes, with all of the characteristics typical of diodes. However, their
construction includes a special layer, called the active layer, which emits photons (light particles) when a
current passes through the layer. The particular properties of the semiconductor are determined by the
materials used and the layering of the materials within the semiconductor. Silicon (Si) and gallium
arsenide (GaAs) are the two most common semiconductor materials used in electronic and electro-optic
devices. In some cases other elements, such as aluminum (Al), indium (In) and phosphorus (P), are added
to the base semiconductor material to modify the semiconductor properties. These elements are called
dopants.
