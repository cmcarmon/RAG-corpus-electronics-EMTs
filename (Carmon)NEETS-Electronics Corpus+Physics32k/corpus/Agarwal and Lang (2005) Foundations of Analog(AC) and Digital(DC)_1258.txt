The latter equality shows that λ(t1) perfectly summarizes, or memorizes, the
entire accumulated history of v(t) for t ≤ t1. Thus,
it is
necessary and sufficient to know v only over the interval t1 ≤ t ≤ t2 in order to
determine λ(t2). For this reason, λ, the total flux linked by the coil, is referred to
as the state of the inductor. For linear time-invariant inductors, i can also easily
serve as a state because i is proportionally related to λ through the constant L.
Accordingly, we can rewrite Equation 9.30 as
