5. The lifetime of color plasma displays can be long. Full color plasma display products have been delivered
with speciﬁed lifetimes to half luminance of 10,000 to 30,000 h. While this is comparable to some CRT
products, there is considerable effort to extend this lifetime further. The failure mode is usually a slow
degradation in the phosphor that gradually decreases the display luminance. If all of the pixels are aged
uniformly, with perhaps a randomly moving television image, the display will still be usable after the speciﬁed
lifetime but at reduced luminance. However, displays used for computer images require a much tougher life
speciﬁcation because images such as icons may be left on the same screen location for long periods and burn
in an image. These problems are very similar to the phosphor degradation observed on a CRT.
