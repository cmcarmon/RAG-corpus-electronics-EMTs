Figure 1.32 shows a 5-V voltage source connected
to an arbitrary circuit at the points x and y. Its terminal variables v and i are defined
according to the associated variables convention as indicated in the figure. Suppose
that a current of 2 A flows into the circuit terminal marked x. What are the values of
v and i?
