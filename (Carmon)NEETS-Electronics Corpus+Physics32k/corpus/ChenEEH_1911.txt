Some arithmetic codes can also provide error correction by
generating unique error syndromes for each single-bit error
(Rao, 1974). In the case of residue coding, this requires mul-
tiple residues, thus increasing the area. For AN coding, it
precludes the use of ‘‘low cost’’ A values, thus increasing the
time spent on decoding. Error correcting codes, therefore, have
such high time and/or area overheads, making them uncom-
petitive with other methods.
