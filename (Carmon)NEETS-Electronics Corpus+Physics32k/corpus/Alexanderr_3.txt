What  I  have  found  that  works  best  for  me  is  to  apply  our  six-
step problem-solving  technique.  Then  I  carefully  identify  the  areas
where  I  have  difﬁculty  solving  the  problem.  Many  times,  my  actual
deﬁciencies  are  in  my  understanding  and  ability  to  use  correctly  cer-
tain  mathematical  principles.  I  then  return  to  my  fundamental  math
texts and carefully review the appropriate sections, and in some cases,
work  some  example  problems  in  that  text.  This  brings  me  to  another
important  thing  you  should  always  do:  Keep  nearby  all  your  basic
mathematics, science, and engineering textbooks.
