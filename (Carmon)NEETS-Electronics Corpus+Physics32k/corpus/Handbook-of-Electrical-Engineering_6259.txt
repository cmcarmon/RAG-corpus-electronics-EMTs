Maximum power output limits are speciÔ¨Åed by the FCC for each type of service. The maximum effective
radiated power (ERP) for low-band VHF is 100 kW; for high-band VHF it is 316 kW; and for UHF it is 5 MW.
The ERP of a station is a function of transmitter power output (TPO) and antenna gain. ERP is determined
by multiplying these two quantities together and subtracting transmission line loss.
