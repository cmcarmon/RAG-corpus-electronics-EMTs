Much as we did for the switch, we can plot the v i characteristics between
the D and S terminals of the MOSFET for various gate-to-source voltages using
the S model. Figure 6.11 shows this graph. Notice that the curves are shown
only for the top-right quadrant. Because we define the drain to be the terminal
with the higher voltage, by definition, vDS can never be negative.6 Therefore, the
left quadrants are irrelevant. Similarly, the bottom-right quadrant is not shown
because iDS is positive when vDS is positive. Unlike the MOSFET, devices for
which this is not true (for example, batteries) are capable of providing power.
Like the switch with a zero on its control input, the connection between the
D and S terminals looks like an open circuit (iDS = 0) when vGS < VT. In
contrast, the connection between D and S looks like a short circuit (vDS = 0)
when vGS â‰¥ VT.
We can summarize the S model for the MOSFET in algebraic form by stating
its v i characteristics as follows:
