The dyne (symbol dyn, from Greek δύναμις, dynamis, meaning power, force) is a unit of force specified in the centimetre–gram–second system of units (CGS), a predecessor of the modern SI. One dyne is equal to 10 micronewtons, 10−5 N or to 10 nsn (nanosthenes) in the old metre–tonne–second system of units. Equivalently, the dyne is defined as "the force required to accelerate a mass of one gram at a rate of one centimetre per second squared":
1 dyn = 1 g⋅cm/s2 = 10−5 kg⋅m/s2 = 10−5 N
1 N = 1 kg⋅m/s2 = 105 g⋅cm/s2 = 105 dyn
The dyne per centimetre is a unit traditionally used to measure surface tension. For example, the surface tension of distilled water is 72 dyn/cm at 25 °C (77 °F); in SI units this is 72×10−3 N/m or 72 mN/m.
