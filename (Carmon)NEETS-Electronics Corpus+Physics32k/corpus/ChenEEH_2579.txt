In general, applications of dielectric resonators are limited to
lower frequencies only since the loss of tangents at millimeter-
wave frequencies may become prohibitive. Furthermore, size
reductions at millimeter wavelengths may be too great to be
practical. An exception may be the whispering-gallery (WG)
mode dielectric resonator that can be generated in a hollow
dielectric cylinder as shown in Figure 7.29(B). This resonator
