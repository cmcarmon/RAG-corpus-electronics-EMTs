There are several laws which describe the transport of matter, or properties of it, in an almost identical way. In every case, in words they read:
Flux (density) is proportional to a gradient, the constant of proportionality is the characteristic of the material.
In general the constant must be replaced by a 2nd rank tensor, to account for directional dependences of the material.
