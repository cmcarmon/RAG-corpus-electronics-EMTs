Notwithstanding heuristics, algorithmic test pattern generation is very computationally expensive and can
pseudo-
encounter numerous difﬁculties, especially in certain types of networks. Newer alternatives are based on 
random pattern generation 
. In this strategy, a large set of patterns
is generated pseudo-randomly with the aid of an inexpensive (hardware or software) generator. Typical choices
for these are linear feedback shift registers and linear cellular automata registers (see below). The pseudo-random
set  is  used  to  stimulate  a  circuit,  and,  using  a  fault  simulator,  one  can  evaluate  the  number  of  faults  that  are
covered by this set. An algorithmic test pattern generator is then applied to ﬁnd coverage for the remaining faults
(hopefully,  a  small  number),  and  the  pseudo-random  set  is  thus  augmented.  The  disadvantages  are  that  the
resulting set is very large and fault simulation is also computationally expensive. However, this method presents
an alternative for circuits where the application of deterministic algorithms for all faults is infeasible.
