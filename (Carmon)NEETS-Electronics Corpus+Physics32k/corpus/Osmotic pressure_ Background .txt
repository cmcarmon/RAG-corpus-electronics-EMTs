In order to visualize this effect, imagine a U-shaped tube with equal amounts of water on each side, separated by a water-permeable membrane made from dialysis tubing at its base that is impermeable to sugar molecules. Sugar has been added to the water on one side. The height of the liquid column on that side will then rise (and that on the other side will drop) proportional to the pressure of the two solutions due to movement of the pure water from the compartment without sugar into the compartment containing the sugar water. This process will stop once the pressures of the water and sugar water on both sides of the membrane become equal.
Jacobus van 't Hoff first proposed a "law" relating osmotic pressure to solute concentration

{\displaystyle \Pi =iM_{\text{solute}}RT}

where



Π


{\displaystyle \Pi }
is osmotic pressure, i is the dimensionless van't Hoff index that addresses solute that dissociates an frequently non-idealities, Msolutes is the molar concentration, R is the Ideal gas constant, and T is the temperature in kelvins. This formula applies when the solute concentration is sufficiently low that the solution can be treated as an ideal solution. The proportionality to concentration means that osmotic pressure is a colligative property. Note the similarity of this formula to the ideal gas law in the form

where n is the total number of moles of gas molecules in the volume V, and n/V is the molar concentration of gas molecules.
van 't Hoff was the first recipient of the Nobel prize for chemistry for his work on osmotic pressure and chemical equilibrium. [1]
A simple extension of this equation was proposed by Harmon Northrop Morse and Frazer.

where molal, m,concentration units are used in place of molarity. This formula extends the range of applicability osmotic pressure calculations to more concentrated solutions. However, it is still limited.

There are no cases in which the law of van't Hoff or the modified form of this law proposed by Morse and Frazer have been shown to hold at concentrations higher than normal. (In a normal solution in water the fraction of the solute is about 0.02.)

Indeed, at very high concentrations van't Hoff's law cannot hold, for the osmotic pressure of a solution approaches infinity as the percentage of solvent approaches zero, while the osmotic pressure calculated from the van't Hoff equation never exceeds a few hundred atmospheres even when we approach the condition of pure solute. On the other hand, it will be shown presently that the law proposed by Morse and Frazer ordinarily gives, at higher concentrations, osmotic pressures far higher than those which actually exist. But often the law of Raoult (and the modified law of Henry) has been shown to hold at all concentrations from 0 per cent. to 100 per cent. of solute, and while in many other cases this law does not hold, the greatest deviations are always found in those cases in which we have reason to believe that the solvent and the solute form complex compounds either with themselves or with each other.

The Raoult-Lewis derivation of osmotic pressure further extends concentration range and accuracy of osmotic pressure calculations is derived below and conventional written as,

in modern text where the molal or molarity concentration units are replaced with the negative natural log of the solvent activity, asolvent, divided by the molar volume, V° , of the solvent.
Historically, van 't Hoff's law and osmotic pressure measurement have been used for the determination molecular weights. The Pfeffer cell was developed for the measurement of osmotic pressure in biology.
