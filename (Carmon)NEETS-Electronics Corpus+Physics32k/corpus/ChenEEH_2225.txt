To calculate the electrostatic ﬁeld of any charge distribution,
equation 2.19 can be used ﬁrst to calculate the electrostatic
potential by integration over the source, and then the vector
electric ﬁeld can be derived from its gradient. By this process,
the potential on the axis of the charged ring of Figure 2.4(A) is
easily obtained. Then, the on-axis potential of the disk follows by
integration over a continuum of rings, as before. The results are
given in Table 2.2. Constructing a spherical shell by integrating
over a series of rings spanning the surface of a sphere (u ¼ 0 to p)
yields the potential of a spherical shell of surface charge density s
and radius a. A similar derivation yields the potential of a
uniformly charged sphere. These are also included in Table 2.2.
The potential function for ensembles of point charges is
particularly simple, even in the near ﬁeld. Thus, for an observa-
tion point anywhere near the dipole of Figure 2.5, the total
potential is given as the scalar sum of the two point source
potentials, shown at the bottom of Table 2.2. The latter discus-
sion naturally applies to the case of two-dimensional charge
distributions. In two dimensions, however, the electrostatic
potential suffers an ambiguity from the inﬁnite length of the
structures in that the potential at inﬁnity becomes undeﬁned.
The solution is to always calculate the potential of pairs of equal
and oppositely charged line charges so that the net charge is zero
