In fluid dynamics, the Froude–Krylov force—sometimes also called the Froude–Kriloff force—is a hydrodynamical force named after William Froude and Alexei Krylov. The Froude–Krylov force is the force introduced by the unsteady pressure field generated by undisturbed waves. The Froude–Krylov force does, together with the diffraction force, make up the total non-viscous forces acting on a floating body in regular waves. The diffraction force is due to the floating body disturbing the waves.
