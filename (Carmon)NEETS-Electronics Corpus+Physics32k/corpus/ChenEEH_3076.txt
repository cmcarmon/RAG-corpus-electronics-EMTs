Characteristics of the core-form transformer are a long mag-
netic path and a shorter mean length of turn. Commonly used
core-form magnetic circuits are single-phase transformers
with a two-legged magnetic path with turns wound around
each leg, a three-legged magnetic path with the center leg
wound with conductor, or a four-legged magnetic path with
the two interior legs wound with conductors (Bean et al., 1959;
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 1943). Three-phase
core-form designs are generally three-legged magnetic cores
with all three legs possessing windings or a ﬁve-legged core
arrangement with the three center legs possessing windings.
The simplest winding arrangement has
the low-voltage
winding nearest the core and the high-voltage winding on
top of the low. Normally, in the core form construction, the
winding system is constructed from helical, layer, or disk-type
windings (Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 1943; Frank-
lin, 1998). The disk-type winding itself can be constructed on
several different winding conﬁgurations (i.e., continuous,
interleaved, and internally shielded), all of which affect the
transient voltage response and this insulation design. Often
the design requirements, such as impedance or shipping size
limitations, call for a core and winding arrangement that is a
more complex arrangement (e.g., interleaving high- and low-
voltage windings, interwound taps, and entry and exit points
other than the top or bottom of the coil). All of these vari-
ations have an effect on the transformer’s transient voltage
