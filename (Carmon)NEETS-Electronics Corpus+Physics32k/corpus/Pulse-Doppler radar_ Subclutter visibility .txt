Subclutter visibility involves the maximum ratio of clutter power to target power, which is proportional to dynamic range. This determines performance in heavy weather and near the earth surface.

{\displaystyle {\text{dynamic range}}=\min {\begin{cases}{\tfrac {\text{carrier power}}{\text{noise power}}}&{\text{transmit noise, where bandwidth is }}{\tfrac {\text{PRF}}{\text{filter size}}}\\2^{{\text{sample bits}}+{\text{filter size}}}&{\text{receiver dynamic range}}\end{cases}}.}

Subclutter visibility is the ratio of the smallest signal that can be detected in the presence of a larger signal.

{\displaystyle {\text{subclutter visibility}}={\frac {\text{dynamic range}}{\text{CFAR detection threshold}}}.}

A small fast-moving target reflection can be detected in the presence of larger slow-moving clutter reflections when the following is true:





target power

{\displaystyle {\text{target power}}>{\frac {\text{clutter power}}{\text{subclutter visibility}}}.}
