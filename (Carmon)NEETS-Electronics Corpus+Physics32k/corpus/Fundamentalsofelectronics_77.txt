The simplest form is when one system’s output is connected only to another’s input. Mathematically,
w (t) = S1 [x (t)], and y (t) = S2 [w (t)], with the information contained in x (t) processed by the ﬁrst, then
the second system. In some cases, the ordering of the systems matter, in others it does not. For example, in
the fundamental model of communication (Figure 1.3) the ordering most certainly matters.
