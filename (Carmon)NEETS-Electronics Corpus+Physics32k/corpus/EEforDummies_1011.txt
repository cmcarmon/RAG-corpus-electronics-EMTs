You may run across a schematic or two that include symbols for test instru-
ments, such as a voltmeter (which measures voltage), an ammeter (which meas  -
ures current), or an ohmmeter (which measures resistance). (As Chapter 16 
explains, a multipurpose multimeter can function as any of these meters — 
and more.) You may see these symbols in schematics on educational web-
sites or in documents designed for educational purposes. They point out 
exactly where to place your meter’s leads to take the measurement properly. 
(The abbreviation TP, for test point, is often used to indicate where to take a 
 measurement.)
