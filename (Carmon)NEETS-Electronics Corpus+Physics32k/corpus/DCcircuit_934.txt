Unlike the Wheatstone and Kelvin bridges, which provide measurement at a condition of
perfect balance and therefore function irrespective of source voltage, the amount of source (or
”excitation”) voltage matters in an unbalanced bridge like this. Therefore, strain gauge bridges
are rated in millivolts of imbalance produced per volt of excitation, per unit measure of force.
A typical example for a strain gauge of the type used for measuring force in industrial envi-
ronments is 15 mV/V at 1000 pounds. That is, at exactly 1000 pounds applied force (either
compressive or tensile), the bridge will be unbalanced by 15 millivolts for every volt of excita-
tion voltage. Again, such a ﬁgure is precise if the bridge circuit is full-active (four active strain
gauges, one in each arm of the bridge), but only approximate for half-bridge and quarter-bridge
arrangements.
