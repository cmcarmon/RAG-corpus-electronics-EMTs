In introductory physics, momentum is usually defined as mass times velocity. However, there is a more fundamental way to define momentum, in terms of translation operators. This is more specifically called canonical momentum, and it is usually but not always equal to mass times velocity; one counterexample is a charged particle in a magnetic field. This definition of momentum is especially important because the law of conservation of momentum applies only to canonical momentum, and is not universally valid if momentum is defined instead as mass times velocity (the so-called "kinetic momentum"), for reasons explained below.
The (canonical) momentum operator is defined as the gradient of the translation operators near the origin:

where ħ is reduced Planck's constant. For example, what is the result when the







p
^




x




{\displaystyle {\hat {p}}_{x}}
operator acts on a quantum state? To find the answer, translate the state by an infinitesimal amount in the x-direction, and calculate the rate that the state is changing, and multiply it by iħ. For example, if a state does not change at all when it is translated in the x-direction, then its x component of momentum is 0.
More explicitly,






p
^





{\displaystyle \mathbf {\hat {p}} }
is a vector operator (i.e. a vector consisting of three operators

{\displaystyle ({\hat {p}}_{x},{\hat {p}}_{y},{\hat {p}}_{z})}

The equation above is the most general definition of

. In the special case of a single particle with wavefunction

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}({\hat {p}}\psi )(r)&=i\hbar \lim _{a\rightarrow 0}{\frac {({\hat {T}}(a)\psi )(r)-\psi (r)}{a}}\\&=i\hbar \lim _{a\rightarrow 0}{\frac {\psi (r-a)-\psi (r)}{a}}\\&=-i\hbar \left({\frac {\partial \psi }{\partial r}}\right)(r)\end{aligned}}}

or in three dimensions,

{\displaystyle \mathbf {\hat {p}} =-i\hbar \nabla }

as an operator acting on position-space wavefunctions. This is the familiar quantum-mechanical expression for






p
^





{\displaystyle \mathbf {\hat {p}} }
, but we have derived it here from a more basic starting point.
We have now defined






p
^





{\displaystyle \mathbf {\hat {p}} }
in terms of translation operators. It is also possible to write a translation operator as a function of






p
^





{\displaystyle \mathbf {\hat {p}} }
. The method is: First, express a given translation as a huge number N of consecutive tiny translations, and then use the fact that infinitesimal translations can be written in terms of






p
^





{\displaystyle \mathbf {\hat {p}} }
:

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\hat {T}}(\mathbf {x} )&=\lim _{N\to \infty }({\hat {T}}(\mathbf {x} /N))^{N}\\&=\lim _{N\rightarrow \infty }\left[1-{\frac {i\mathbf {x} \cdot \mathbf {\hat {p}} }{N\hbar }}\right]^{N}\end{aligned}}}

which gives the final expression:

where exp is operator exponential and the right-hand side is the Taylor series expansion. For very small x, one can use the approximation:

{\displaystyle {\hat {T}}(\mathbf {x} )\approx 1-i\mathbf {x} \cdot \mathbf {\hat {p}} /\hbar }

Hence, momentum operator is referred to as the generator of translation.
A nice way to double-check that these relations are correct is to do Taylor expansion of a translation operator acting on a position-space wavefunction. Expanding the exponential to all orders, the translation operator generates exactly the full Taylor expansion of a test function:

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\psi (\mathbf {r} -\mathbf {x} )&={\hat {T}}(\mathbf {x} )\psi (\mathbf {r} )\\&=\exp \left(-{\frac {i\mathbf {x} \cdot \mathbf {\hat {p}} }{\hbar }}\right)\psi (\mathbf {r} )\\&=\left(\sum _{n=0}^{\infty }{\frac {1}{n!}}(-{\frac {i}{\hbar }}\mathbf {x} \cdot \mathbf {\hat {p}} )^{n}\right)\psi (\mathbf {r} )\\&=\left(\sum _{n=0}^{\infty }{\frac {1}{n!}}(-\mathbf {x} \cdot \mathbf {\nabla } )^{n}\right)\psi (\mathbf {r} )\\&=\psi (\mathbf {r} )-\mathbf {x} \cdot \mathbf {\nabla } \psi (\mathbf {r} )+{\frac {1}{2!}}(\mathbf {x} \cdot \mathbf {\nabla } )^{2}\psi (\mathbf {r} )-\dots \end{aligned}}}

So every translation operator generates exactly the expected translation on a test function if the function is analytic in some domain of the complex plane.
