The magnetostriction



λ


{\displaystyle \lambda }
characterizes the shape change of a ferromagnetic material during magnetization, whereas the inverse magnetostrictive effect characterizes the change of sample magnetization



M


{\displaystyle M}
(for given magnetizing field strength



H


{\displaystyle H}
) when mechanical stresses



σ


{\displaystyle \sigma }
are applied to the sample.
