sources or asymmetries exist that would start a real oscillatorâ€”it must be done manually. The capacitor C1
would have to be placed off-chip, and bond pad capacitance (CPAD1 and CPAD2) have been included at the
capacitor  nodes.  Including  the  pad  capacitances  is  very  important  if  a  small  capacitor  C1  is  used  for  high-
frequency operation.
