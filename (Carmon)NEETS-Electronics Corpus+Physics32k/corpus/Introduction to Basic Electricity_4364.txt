Another type of buffer is the three-state  buffer 
shown with its truth table in Figure 42-17. The three-
state buffer has the usual 1 and 0 output states but it 
also has a third state, which is referred to as a high-
impedance state. This state provides an open circuit 
between the input circuitry and the output and is 
controlled by the EN line. The EN line represents an 
 enable/disable control input. Figure 42-18 shows how 
the three-state buffer operates.
