we have K equations in N unknowns if we want to ﬁnd the signal from its sampled spectrum. This require-
ment is impossible to fulﬁll if K < N; we must have K ≥ N. Our orthogonality relation essentially says that
if we have a suﬃcient number of equations (frequency samples), the resulting set of equations can indeed be
solved.
