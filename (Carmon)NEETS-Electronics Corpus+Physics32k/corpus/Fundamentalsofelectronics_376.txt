4.4 A Signal’s Power Spectrum8
A periodic signal, such as the half-wave rectiﬁed sinusoid, consists of a sum of elemental sinusoids. A plot
of the Fourier coeﬃcients as a function of the frequency index, such as shown in Figure 4.3 (Fourier Series
spectrum of a half-wave rectiﬁed sine wave), displays the signal’s spectrum. The word “spectrum” implies
that the independent variable, here k, corresponds somehow to frequency. Each coeﬃcient is directly related
to a sinusoid having a frequency of k/T . Thus, if we half-wave rectiﬁed a 1 kHz sinusoid, k = 1 corresponds
to 1 kHz, k = 2 to 2 kHz, etc.
