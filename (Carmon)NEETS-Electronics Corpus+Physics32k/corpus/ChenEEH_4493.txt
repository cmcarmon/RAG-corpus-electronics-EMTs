In this model, the states are measured with the sensor noise,
dv/dt. A Kalman Ô¨Ålter is then used to estimate the states. The
following simulations are performed using MATLAB, a soft-
ware package. The RS controller is found using equation 5.35.
Note that both yaw and roll angles reduce to a value close to
the origin. Figure 5.2 shows the roll and yaw angles with
respect to time variation. After about 3 hours, both roll and
yaw angles stay below 0.1 degree. Initially, large control action
is needed, but after 3 hours or so, less than 300 Atm2 magnetic
