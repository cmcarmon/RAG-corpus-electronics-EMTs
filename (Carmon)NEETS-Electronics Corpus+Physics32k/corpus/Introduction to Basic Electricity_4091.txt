overshoot occurs when the leading edge of a wave-
form exceeds its normal maximum value.  undershoot 
occurs when the trailing edge exceeds its normal mini-
mum value. (The leading edge is the front edge of the 
waveform; the trailing edge is the back edge of the 
waveform.) Both conditions are followed by damped 
oscillations known as ringing. These conditions are 
undesirable but exist because of imperfect circuits.
