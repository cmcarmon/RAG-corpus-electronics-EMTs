compression standard is based on the Huffman and run-length encoding of the quantized discrete cosine transform (DCT)
coefÔ¨Åcients of image blocks. JPEG is a lossy compression. Standard JPEG encoding does not allow interlacing, but the progressive
JPEG format does. Progressive JPEGs start out with large blocks of color that gradually become more detailed.
