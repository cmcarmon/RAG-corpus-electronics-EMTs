It has been proven that electrons (negative charges) move through a conductor in response to an
electric field. ELECTRON CURRENT FLOW will be used throughout this explanation. Electron current
is defined as the directed flow of electrons. The direction of electron movement is from a region of
negative potential to a region of positive potential. Therefore electric current can be said to flow from
negative to positive. The direction of current flow in a material is determined by the polarity of the
applied voltage. NOTE: In some electrical/electronic communities, the direction of current flow is
recognized as being from positive to negative.
