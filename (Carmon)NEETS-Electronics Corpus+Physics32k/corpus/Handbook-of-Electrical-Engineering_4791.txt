Signiﬁcant differences have been observed in the quality of the ﬁlms depending on the nature of the substrate.
The quality can be described by intrinsic parameters such as the crystallinity (i.e., the degree to which non-
crystalline phases are present). The uniformity of the orientation of the crystallites also seems to play a role in
determining the electrical properties of the ﬁlms. In the extreme case of perfect alignment of the crystallites of
the ﬁlm with the substrate and the formation of large single crystal areas, an epitaxial ﬁlm is obtained. These
ﬁlms  tend  to  have  the  best  electrical  properties.  In  addition  to  amorphous  material,  other  crystalline  but
nonferroelectric phases can be present. An example is the pyrochlore phase in PZT. These phases often form
incidentally to the growth process of the desired ﬁlm and usually degrade one or more of the desired properties
of  the  ﬁlm  (for  instance  the  dielectric  constant).  The  pyrochlore  and  other  oxide  materials  can  accumulate
between the Pt electrode and the desired PZT or BST layer. The interface layer is then electrically in series with
the desired dielectric layer and degrades its properties. The apparent reduction of the dielectric constant which
is often observed in these ﬁlms as the thickness is reduced can be attributed to the presence of these low dielectric
constant layers.
