Fiber drawing facilities are usually located in a clean room where the air is maintained at class 10,000. The
region of the preform and ﬁber from the coating cup to the top of the preform is maintained at class 100 or
better. A class 100 environment means that there are no more than 100 particles of size greater than 0.5 mm in
1 ft3 of air. A clean environment, proper centering of the preform in the furnace and ﬁber in the coating cup,
and  proper  alignment  of  the  whole  draw  tower  ensure  a  scratch-free  ﬁber  of  a  very  high  tensile  strength. A
control unit regulates the draw speed, preform feed speed, preform centering, ﬁber diameter, furnace temper-
ature, and draw tension.
