If the vector field associated to a force




F



{\displaystyle \mathbf {F} }
is conservative, then the force is said to be a conservative force.
The most prominent examples of conservative forces are the gravitational force and the electric force associated to an electrostatic field. According to Newton's law of gravitation, the gravitational force

{\displaystyle \mathbf {F} _{G}}

{\displaystyle \mathbf {F} _{G}=-{\frac {GmM}{r^{2}}}{\hat {\mathbf {r} }},}

is the gravitational constant and







r

{\displaystyle {\hat {\mathbf {r} }}}
is a unit vector pointing from

is the gravitational potential energy.
For conservative forces, path independence can be interpreted to mean that the work done in going from a point

{\displaystyle A}
to a point



B


{\displaystyle B}
is independent of the path chosen, and that the work

{\displaystyle W}
done in going around a simple closed loop is

{\displaystyle W=\oint _{C}\mathbf {F} \cdot d{\mathbf {r} }=0.}

The total energy of a particle moving under the influence of conservative forces is conserved, in the sense that a loss of potential energy is converted to an equal quantity of kinetic energy, or vice versa.
