TELETYPEWRITER SETS.â€”Most of the teletypewriter sets used by the Navy belong to one 
family of tty equipment. This equipment features various weights and sizes, quiet operation, and high 
operating speeds. They present relatively few maintenance problems. Because of this they are well suited 
for severe shipboard conditions of roll, vibration, and shock.
