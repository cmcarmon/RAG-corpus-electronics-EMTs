The overall effect of connecting capacitors in series is to move the plates of the capacitors further apart.
This is shown in figure 3-13. Notice that the junction between C1 and C2 has both a negative and a positive
charge. This causes the junction to be essentially neutral. The total capacitance of the circuit is developed
between the left plate of C1 and the right plate of C2. Because these plates are farther apart, the total value
of the capacitance in the circuit is decreased. Solving for the total capacitance (CT) of capacitors connected
in series is similar to solving for the total resistance (RT) of resistors connected in parallel.
