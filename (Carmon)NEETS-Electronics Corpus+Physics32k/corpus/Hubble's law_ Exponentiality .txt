While current evidence suggests that the expansion of the universe is accelerating, Hubble's Law implies that all derivatives of the expansion of the universe are increasing. This is readily seen as the comoving distance,



D


{\displaystyle D}
, is proportional to its own time derivative, v. Solving the relation for time yields

{\displaystyle t=\int _{D_{i}}^{D}{\frac {dD}{H_{0}\cdot D}}}

where




D

i




{\displaystyle D_{i}}
is the distance at which a galaxy is first measured at and



t


{\displaystyle t}
is the time since said measurement, thus the velocity of a galaxy can be expressed as

{\displaystyle D=e^{H_{0}t}\cdot D_{i}}
, with the implication that the comoving distance between two galaxies increases exponentially as time goes on. This lines up with current observations, however; it has not been shown for derivatives of distance above acceleration.
The above relations only hold so long as the Hubble parameter,




H

0




{\displaystyle H_{0}}
, is constant; which it is presumed not to be. In order for the acceleration of the expansion of the universe to stop, however; the Hubble parameter must be inversely proportional to time. That is,

{\displaystyle H_{0}={\frac {k}{t}}}
for some constant

{\displaystyle D=e^{k}\cdot D_{i}}
