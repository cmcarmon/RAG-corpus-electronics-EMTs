Frequencies above 30 megahertz are not normally refracted by the atmosphere and ground-wave 
range is minimal. This normally limits our use of this frequency spectrum to line of sight. The exception 
to this is increased range through the use of tropospheric scatter techniques. Some communications using 
vhf and above frequencies use a technique called forward propagation by tropospheric scatter (fpts). This 
method will be discussed in more detail in chapter 5.
