The pointer on the right-hand dial (fig. 1-46) registers 1 kilowatt-hour, or 1,000 watt-hours, for each
division of the dial. A complete revolution of the hand on this dial will move the hand of the second dial
one division and register 10 kilowatt-hours, or 10,000 watt-hours. A complete revolution of the hand of
the second dial will move the third hand one division and register 100 kilowatt-hours or 100,000
watt-hours, and so on.
