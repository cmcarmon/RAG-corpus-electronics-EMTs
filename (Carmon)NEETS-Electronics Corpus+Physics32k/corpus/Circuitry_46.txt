The dielectric  strength  of an insulating dielectric 
is  the  maximum  electric  field  strength  that  can 
safely  be  applied 
it  before  breakdown 
(conduction)  occurs.  Table  1.4    shows  values  of 
relative  permittivity  and  dielectric  strength  for 
some common dielectric materials.
