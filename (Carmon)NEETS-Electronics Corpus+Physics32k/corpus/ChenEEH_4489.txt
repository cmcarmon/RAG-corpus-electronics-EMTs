Therefore, the minimal cost mean and minimal cost variance
problems can be viewed as ﬁrst- and second-order approxima-
tions of the RS control problem respectively. Minimizing the
VAR{J } under the restriction that the ﬁrst cumulant E{J } exists
is called the minimal cost variance (MCV) problem. More-
over, minimizing any linear combination of cost cumulants
under certain restrictions would be called cost-cumulant or
statistical control. Thus, classical LQG control (optimization of
the ﬁrst cumulant), MCV control (optimization of the second
cumulant), and RS control (optimization of
the inﬁnite
number of cumulants) are all special cases of the cost-cumu-
lant control problem.
