Minimizing the power loss in the lines (known as I2R loss) is important from the viewpoint
of efÔ¨Åciency and reducing the amount of heat generated in the wiring for safety considerations.
Since the power loss in the lines is directly related to the current required by the load, a lower
line loss will be incurred with the 240-V wiring in delivering the necessary power to a load. For
the lower voltage case, however, the size of the wires is increased, thereby reducing the wire
resistance, in an effort to minimize line losses. Problem 4.4.2 deals with these considerations.
