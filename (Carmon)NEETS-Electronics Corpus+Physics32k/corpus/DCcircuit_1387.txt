When inductors are connected in series, the total inductance is the sum of the individual induc-
tors’ inductances. To understand why this is so, consider the following: the deﬁnitive measure
of inductance is the amount of voltage dropped across an inductor for a given rate of current
change through it. If inductors are connected together in series (thus sharing the same current,
and seeing the same rate of change in current), then the total voltage dropped as the result of
a change in current will be additive with each inductor, creating a greater total voltage than
either of the individual inductors alone. Greater voltage for the same rate of change in current
means greater inductance.
