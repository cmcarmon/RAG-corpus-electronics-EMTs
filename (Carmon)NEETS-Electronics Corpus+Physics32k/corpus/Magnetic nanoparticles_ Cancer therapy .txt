In magnetic fluid hyperthermia, nanoparticles of different types like Iron oxide, magnetite, maghemite or even gold are injected in tumor and then subjected under a high frequency magnetic field. These nanoparticles produce heat that typically increases tumor temperature to 40-46 Â°C, which can kill cancer cells. Another major potential of magnetic nanoparticles is the ability to combine heat (hyperthermia) and drug release for a cancer treatment. Numerous studies have shown particle constructs that can be loaded with a drug cargo and magnetic nanoparticles. The most prevalent construct is the "Magnetoliposome", which is a liposome with magnetic nanoparticles typically embedded in the lipid bilayer. Under an alternating magnetic field, the magnetic nanoparticles are heated, and this heat permeabilizes the membrane. This causes release of the loaded drug. This treatment option has a lot of potential as the combination of hyperthermia and drug release is likely to treat tumors better than either option alone, but it is still under development.
