However, the applied frequency must be low enough to avoid skin effect, stray inductance,
capacitance, and coupling between circuit elements and wiring. The leads must be kept short to eliminate
stray reactance, which causes bridge imbalance. The rectifier circuit wiring must be isolated from other
bridge component fields so that induced voltages do not cause an erroneous indication. You should only
use resistors having negligible capacitance and inductance effects.
