This  expansion  of  the  depletion  layer  continues  to  balance  the  addition  of  gate  charge  until  threshold  is
reached.  Then  this  charge  response  changes:  above  threshold  any  additional  gate  charge  is  balanced  by  an
increasingly  strong  inversion  layer  or  channel.  The  border  between  a  depletion-layer  and  an  inversion-layer
response, threshold, should occur when
