The effective exhaust velocity is often specified as a specific impulse and they are related to each other by:





v

e


=

g

0



I

sp


,


{\displaystyle v_{\text{e}}=g_{0}I_{\text{sp}},}

where





I

sp




{\displaystyle I_{\text{sp}}}
is the specific impulse in seconds,





v

e




{\displaystyle v_{\text{e}}}
is the specific impulse measured in m/s, which is the same as the effective exhaust velocity measured in m/s (or ft/s if g is in ft/s2),





g

0




{\displaystyle g_{0}}
is the standard gravity, 9.80665 m/s2 (in Imperial units 32.174 ft/s2).
