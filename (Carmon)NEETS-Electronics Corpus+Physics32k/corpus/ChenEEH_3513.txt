. Continuous-time or analog signals: A continuous-
time or an analog signal xc is a mapping xc: R ! R ,
where the domain is R and the range is a subset of the
real line. A continuous-time signal will be denoted as
xc (t) and not xc, using the engineering convention of
attaching the time variable as argument. This may be a
source of confusion at times, but this aspect is clariﬁed
later. An example of a continuous-time signal
is a
speech signal: the acoustic pressure assumes a con-
tinuum of values, and pressure is deﬁned at values of
the independent variable, time, on the entire real line.
Figure 1.1 shows an example of a continuous-time or
an analog signal.
