The characteristic curves of a typical JFET are shown in ﬁgure 5.16. At small values
of VDS (in the range of a few tenths of a volt), the curves of constant VGS show a linear
relationship between VDS and ID. This is the variable-resistance region of the graph. As
VDS increases, each of the curves of constant VGS enters a region of nearly constant ID.
This is the pinch-oﬀ region, where the JFET can be used as a linear voltage and current
ampliﬁer. At VGS = 0 the current through the JFET reaches a maximum known as IDSS,
the current from Drain to Source with the gate Shorted to the source. If VGS goes positive
for this N-channel JFET, the PN junction becomes conducting and the JFET becomes just
a forward-biased diode.
