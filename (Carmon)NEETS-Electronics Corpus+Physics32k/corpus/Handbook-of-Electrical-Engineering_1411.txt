Three major aspects of speech enhancement were reviewed. These comprise improving the perception of speech
signals in noisy environments and increasing the robustness of speech coders and recognition systems in noisy
environments. The inherent difﬁculties associated with these problems were discussed, and the main solutions
along with their strengths and weaknesses were presented. This section is an introductory presentation to the
speech enhancement problem. A comprehensive treatment of the subject can be found in Lim [1979], Makhoul
et al.  [1989],  Boll  [1992],  and  Ephraim  [1992].  Signiﬁcant  progress  in  understanding  the  problem  and  in
developing new speech enhancement systems was made during the 1980s with the introduction of statistical
model-based  approaches.  The  speech  enhancement  problem,  however,  is  far  from  being  solved,  and  major
progress  is  still  needed.  In  particular,  no  speech  enhancement  system  which  is  capable  of  simultaneously
improving both the quality and intelligibility of the noisy signal is currently known. Progress in this direction
can be made if more reliable statistical models for the speech signal and noise process as well as meaningful
distortion measures can be found.
