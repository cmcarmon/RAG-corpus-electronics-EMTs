In  1984,  following  the  divestiture  of  the  Regional  Bell  Operating  Companies  from  AT&T,  the  regional
companies  began  planning  to  deploy  their  own  common-channel signaling  (CCS) networks  and  their  own
centralized databases. They selected the signaling system 7 protocol for use in their signaling networks, called
CCS7 networks, and they named their databases service control points (SCPs).
