Many  analytical  models  have  been  developed  for  the  impedance  and  radiation  properties  of  microstrip
antennas  [James  and  Hall,  1989],  but  most  of  the  qualitative  behavior  of  the  element  can  be  demonstrated
using the relatively simple transmission line model. As shown in Fig. 38.15, the patch element is modeled as a
length, L, of microstrip transmission line of characteristic impedance Z0. The characteristic impedance of the
line can be found using simple approximations [Pozar, 1990] and is a function of the width, W, of the line as
well  as  the  substrate  thickness  and  dielectric  constant.  The  ends  of  the  transmission  line  are  terminated  in
