EMC is often perceived as interference by electromagnetic radiation between the various elements of a system.
The  scope  of  EMC,  however,  is  more  general  and  it  also  includes  conductive  propagation  and  coupling  by
capacitance, inductance (self and mutual) encompassing the whole frequency spectrum.
