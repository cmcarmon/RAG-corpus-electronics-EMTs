, consisting of a spinning wheel whose axle is constrained
to the horizontal plane (often by a pendulum). The shipsâ€™ version points north, when properly compensated

for vehicle motion, and exhibits errors less than a degree. The aircraft version (more properly called a 
) holds any preset heading relative to earth and drifts at 50 deg/hr or more. Inexpensive gyroscopes

(some built on silicon chips as vibrating beams with on-chip signal conditioning) are often coupled to magnetic
compasses to reduce maneuver-induced errors.
