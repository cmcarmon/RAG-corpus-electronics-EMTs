An antiferromagnetic layer is required to pin one of the ferromagnetic layers (i.e., make it fixed or magnetically hard). This results from a large negative exchange coupling energy between ferromagnets and antiferromagnets in contact.
The non-magnetic layer is required to decouple the two ferromagnetic layers so that at least one of them remains free (magnetically soft).
