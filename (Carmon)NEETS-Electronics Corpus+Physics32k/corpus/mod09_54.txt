both contain "f" (frequency). Any change of frequency changes the reactance of the circuit components as 
already explained. So far, nothing has been said about the effect of frequency on resistance. In an Ohm's 
law relationship, such as R = E/I no "f" is involved. Thus, for all practical purposes, a change of 
frequency does not affect the resistance of the circuit. If a 60-hertz a.c. voltage causes 20 milliamperes of 
current in a resistive circuit, then the same voltage at 2000 hertz, for example, would still cause 20 
milliamperes to flow.
