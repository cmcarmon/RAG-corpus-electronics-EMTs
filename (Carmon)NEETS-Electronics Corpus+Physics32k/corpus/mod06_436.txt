the circuit in THE SAME DIRECTION. Current that flows in pulses in the same direction is called 
PULSATING DC. The diode has thus RECTIFIED the input voltage. Although the principle of 
rectification applies to all rectifier circuits, some rectifiers are more efficient than others. For this reason,
