Metabolic cost is naturally optimized by selection of a nominal gait. While external factors such as instability and perceived dangers may temporarily alter the bodyâ€™s priorities, the primary goal of minimizing a task-dependent energetic expenditure ultimately dominates the determination of preferred walking gait. As a result, humans tend to select a preferred walking speed that minimizes their cost of transport. The relationship between walking and cost of transport is parabola-like with the preferred walking speed at the minimum, meaning walking at a slower or faster speed can incur a similar increase in energetic cost for a 1-kilometer walk. Within each walking speed, the step length and cadence are also optimized for metabolic cost. While multiple proportional combinations of step length and cadence can be used to achieve the same walking speed, taking faster and shorter steps or slower and longer steps than the optimal combination leads to increased cost of transport.
