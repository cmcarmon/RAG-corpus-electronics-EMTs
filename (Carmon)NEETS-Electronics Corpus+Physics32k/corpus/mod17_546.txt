Most operational military satellite earth terminals are housed in transportable vans. These can be 
loaded into cargo planes and flown to remote areas. With trained crews these terminals can be put into 
operation in a matter of hours. Worldwide communications can be established quickly to remote areas 
nearly anywhere in the free world.
