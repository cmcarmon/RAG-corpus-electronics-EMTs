As of spring 2010, ARTEMIS P1 (THEMIS B) had performed two Lunar flybys and one Earth flyby, and was approaching insertion into a Lissajous orbit around a Lunar Lagrange point. Lunar orbit insertion was targeted for April 2011. ARTEMIS P2 (THEMIS C) completed a Lunar flyby and was on the inbound leg of the first of three deep space excursions on its way to a Lissajous orbit and was targeted for Lunar orbit in April 2011.
On June 22, 2011, ARTEMIS P1 began firing its thrusters to move out of its kidney-shaped "libration" orbit on one side of the Moon, where it had been since January. As of July 2, 2011 12:30 p.m. EDT, ARTEMIS P1 achieved lunar orbit. The second spacecraft, ARTEMIS P2, moved into lunar orbit as of July 17, 2011. Along the way, the two spacecraft were the first to ever achieve orbit around the Moon's Lagrangian points.
As of August 2017, both lunar probes are in stable orbits, and the health of all instruments and the spacecraft remains very good.
