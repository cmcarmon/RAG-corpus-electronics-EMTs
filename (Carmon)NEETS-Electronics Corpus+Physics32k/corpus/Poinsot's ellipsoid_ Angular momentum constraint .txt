The law of conservation of angular momentum states that in the absence of applied torques, the angular momentum vector




L



{\displaystyle \mathbf {L} }
is conserved in an inertial reference frame, so






d

=
0


{\displaystyle {\frac {d\mathbf {L} }{dt}}=0}
.
The angular momentum vector




L



{\displaystyle \mathbf {L} }
can be expressed in terms of the moment of inertia tensor




I



{\displaystyle \mathbf {I} }
and the angular velocity vector




ω



{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\omega }}}






L

=

I

⋅

ω



{\displaystyle \mathbf {L} =\mathbf {I} \cdot {\boldsymbol {\omega }}}

which leads to the equation




T

L

.


{\displaystyle T={\frac {1}{2}}{\boldsymbol {\omega }}\cdot \mathbf {L} .}

Since the dot product of




ω



{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\omega }}}
and




L



{\displaystyle \mathbf {L} }
is constant, and




L



{\displaystyle \mathbf {L} }
itself is constant, the angular velocity vector




ω



{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\omega }}}
has a constant component in the direction of the angular momentum vector




L



{\displaystyle \mathbf {L} }
. This imposes a second constraint on the vector




ω



{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\omega }}}
; in absolute space, it must lie on an invariable plane defined by its dot product with the conserved vector




L



{\displaystyle \mathbf {L} }
. The normal vector to the invariable plane is aligned with




L



{\displaystyle \mathbf {L} }
. The path traced out by the angular velocity vector




ω



{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\omega }}}
on the invariable plane is called the herpolhode (coined from Greek roots for "serpentine pole path").
The herpolhode is generally an open curve, which means that the rotation does not perfectly repeat, but the polhode is a closed curve.
