instantaneous velocity in a single dimension, k is Boltzmannâ€™s constant, and T is the temperature in kelvin. A
shunt capacitor C is charged by the thermal noise in the resistor [see Fig. 73.6(b), where L is taken to be zero].
The average potential energy stored is (1/2)CE[W(t)2]. Equating this to 1/2kT and solving, we obtain the mean
square power
