As a consequence of the quadratic nature of the electrostriction effect, the sign of the strain produced in the
material is independent of the polarity of the ﬁeld. This is in contrast with linear piezoelectricity where reversing
the direction of the ﬁeld causes a change in the sign of the strain. The sign of the electrostrictive strain depends
only  on  the  sign  of  the  electrostriction  coefﬁcient.  In  most  oxide  ceramics,  the  longitudinal  electrostriction
coefﬁcients are positive. The transverse coefﬁcients are negative as expected from Poisson ratio effects. Another
consequence  is  that  electrostrictive  strain  occurs  at  twice  the  frequency  of  an  applied  ac  ﬁeld.  In  acentric
materials,  where  both  piezoelectric  and  electrostrictive  strains  may  be  observed,  this  fact  is  very  useful  in
separating the strains arising from piezoelectricity and from electrostriction.
