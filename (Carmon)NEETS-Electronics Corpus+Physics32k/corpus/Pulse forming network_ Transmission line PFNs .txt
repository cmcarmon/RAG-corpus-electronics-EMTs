A length of transmission line can be used as a pulse forming network. This can give substantially flat topped pulses at the inconvenience of using of a large length of cable.
In a simple charged transmission line pulse generator (animation, right) a length of transmission line such as a coaxial cable is connected through a switch to a matched load RL at one end, and at the other end to a DC voltage source V through a resistor RS which is large compared to the characteristic impedance Z0 of the line. When the power supply is connected it slowly charges up the capacitance of the line through RS. When the switch is closed, a voltage equal to V/2 is applied to the load, the charge stored in the line begins to discharge through the load a current of V/2Z0 and a voltage step travels up the line toward the source. The source end of the line is approximately an open circuit due to the high RS, so the step is reflected uninverted and travels back down the line toward the load. The result is that a pulse of voltage is applied to the load with a duration equal to 2D/c where D is the length of the line and c is the propagation velocity of the pulse in the line. The propagation velocity in typical transmission lines is within 50% of the speed of light. For example, in most types of coaxial cable the propagation velocity is approximately 2/3 the speed of light, or 20 cm per nanosecond.
High power PFNs generally use specialized transmission lines consisting of pipes filled with oil or deionized water as a dielectric to handle the high power dissipation.
A disadvantage of simple PFN pulse generators is that because the transmission line must be matched to the load resistance RL to prevent reflections, the voltage stored on the line is divided equally between the load resistance and the characteristic impedance of the line, so the voltage pulse applied to the load is only one-half the power supply voltage.
