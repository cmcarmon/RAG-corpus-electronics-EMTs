Notice that if we connect nodes with identical voltages by an ideal wire it does not
draw any current and does not change the behavior of the circuit. Therefore, for the
purpose of computing the resistance, we can connect all nodes with identical voltages,
and simplify the network to the one shown in Figure 2.54.
