In a normal subject at rest, the electrical activity monitored during insertion of the needle electrode consists
of a short burst of muscle action potentials displayed on the oscilloscope and heard in the loudspeaker. These
action potentials are called insertion potentials and subside quickly in the normal muscle. When the muscle is
at rest, there is no electrical activity (electrical silence). If the muscle is contracted voluntarily, the frequency
of action potentials increases with the force developed by the muscle. However, there is no linear or constant
relationship between these two events. Each action potential, called a normal motor-unit potential, lasts a few
milliseconds to the Ô¨Årst zero crossing, as shown in Fig. 113.18(E).
