In circuits involving discrete transistors, BJTs are often used as a switch to turn 
on  and  off  currents  to  components  such  as  LED’s.  Figure  ###  shows  four  such 
configurations  where  NPN  and  PNP  transistors  are  used  to  switch  on  and  off  loads 
connected to a 5V power supply. In each configuration, the input signal is connected to 
the base via the current-limiting resistor (Rb). Since the base-emitter junction behaves as a 
diode,  the  voltage  across  the  base-emitter  junction  is  effectively  held  at  0.7V.  The 
function  of  Rb  is  to  limit  the  amount  of  current  between  base  and  emitter  to  prevent 
burning out the transistor. Typically, values ranging from 500 Ω to 50kΩ are acceptable.
