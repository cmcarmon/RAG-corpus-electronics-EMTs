The term singularity for an explanation of unstable systems was first, and in a most general meaning used in 1873 by James Clerk Maxwell. Maxwell does not differentiate between dynamical systems and social systems. Therefore, a singularity refers to a context in which a small change can cause a large effect. The existence of singularities is primarily an argument against determinism and absolute causality for Maxwell. Indeed, following the same initial conditions will always achieve the same results, but such a statement is of little value in a world in which the same initial conditions are never repeated.
