The scheme in the Accident Towing Services Act broadly sets economic, occupational and general consumer protection controls over the accident towing industry in Victoria.
First, the statute enables maximum numbers of accident towing vehicles to be set across the State through licensing controls and also facilitates the orderly allocation of tow trucks to road accident sites. Second, the Act sets minimum standards on the character of industry participants and regulates the behaviour of the participants once they enter the industry.
The framework of offences in the Act broadly seeks to give practical effect to the "chain of responsibility" concept in the accident towing sector. The concept seeks to identify the industry parties who are in a sufficient position of control over risks, in this case potentially unsafe and unethical conduct following road accidents, and to allocate responsibility through law accordingly in order to deter and punish those behaviours in the interest of a safe, clean and efficient industry.
The behavioural controls in the Act cover a wide range of activities and practices including the systematic allocation of tow trucks to accident sites in "controlled areas" and conduct at road accident sites and during post accident repair work.
The scheme was broadly prompted by consumer protection sentiment, in particular, the recognition of the vulnerability of road accident victims. Care was evident during the development of the scheme to maintain and enhance existing character standards in the accident towing sector due to behavioural issues in Victoria in the past including the infiltration of criminal elements into some areas of the industry and resultant "predatory towing" activities.
