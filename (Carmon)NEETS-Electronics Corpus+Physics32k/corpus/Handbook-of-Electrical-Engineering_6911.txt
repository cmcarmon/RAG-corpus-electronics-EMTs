We  can  ﬁnd  the  signal-to-noise  voltage  ratio  for  the  total  range  R  via  R/(dv/(12)1/2 )  =  2n dv/(dv/(12)1/2)  =
2n (12)1/2.  The  power  ratio  is  the  square  of  this,  which  is  (22n)(12).  In  decibels  this  becomes  (S/N)dB  =
10 log10(22 n · 12) = 10 log10(12) + 20n log10(2) = 10.8 + 6.02n. Thus, quantization S/N power ratio depends
directly upon the number of bits n in that the higher S/N power ratio is better, just as we would have expected.
