Since the bipolar transistor has three terminals, it can be operated in various conﬁgurations, depending upon
the electrode selected as the common terminal. The two most commonly employed are the common emitter
(CE) and the common base (CB) conﬁgurations, although the common collector (CC) conﬁguration can also
be  used.  Small-signal  ampliﬁers  generally  use  the  CE  conﬁguration  and  power  ampliﬁers  often  use  the  CB
conﬁguration.
