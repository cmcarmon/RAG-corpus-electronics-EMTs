Note that when the output is in the high state, the PMOS is on with the NMOS being off;
when the output is in the low state, the NMOS is on with the PMOS being off. Virtually no current
is drawn from the power supply in either case. The CMOS has the advantage that it uses no power
except when it is actually switching. This property of virtually no power consumption, coupled
with the small chip surface needed, makes the CMOS very favorable for miniature and low-
power applications such as wristwatches and calculators. Because of the poor switching speeds
(compared to TTL), they are applied to low- to medium-speed devices. The principal disadvantage
of the CMOS is a more complex fabrication procedure than that of the NMOS, leading to more
defects and higher cost.
