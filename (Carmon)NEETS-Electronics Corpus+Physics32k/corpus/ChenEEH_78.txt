The ﬁrst- and second-order terms can occur in the numerator
or denominator of the rational function H(jv). Normalized
plots for these terms are shown in ﬁgures 1.31 and 1.32.
Bode diagrams for any function can be made using the
normalized plots as building blocks. Figure 1.31 shows the
Bode diagrams for a ﬁrst-order term based on the following
equations:
