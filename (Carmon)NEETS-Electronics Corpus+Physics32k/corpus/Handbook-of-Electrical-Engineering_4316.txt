graded-index proﬁle. For triangular, parabolic, and step-index proﬁles, 
shows  the  raypaths  in  step-index  and  graded-index  ﬁbers  and  the  cylindrical  coordinate  system  used  in  the
analysis  of  lightwave  propagation  through  ﬁbers.  Because  rays  propagating  within  the  core  in  a  GRIN  ﬁber
undergo progressive refraction, the raypaths are curved (sinusoidal in the case of parabolic proﬁle).
