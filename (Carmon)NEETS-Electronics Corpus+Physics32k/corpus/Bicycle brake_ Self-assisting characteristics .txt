If the front brake is mounted behind the fork a so-called self-assisting effect occurs. The friction force between brake shoe and rim creates a bending moment which presses the shoe even stronger on the rim thus leading to an amplified brake force. Self-assist reduces the input force needed to apply the brake. A disadvantage might be brake fade - a non-linear relation between actuation force and brake force.
