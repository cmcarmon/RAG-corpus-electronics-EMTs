The discipline of image analysis is a very vast one. It deals with
the automatic extraction of information from an image or
sequence of images. It is also an essential part of computer
vision systems. In this section, we provide a brief overview
of its main issues. For a more detailed treatment, the reader
is referred to some excellent texts on image processing and
computer vision, such as Castleman (1979), Faugeras (1993),
Gonzales and Wintz (1977), Haralick and Shapiro (1992,
1993), Jain (1989), Law (1991), Pratt (1978), Rosenfeld and
Kak (1982), and Russ (1995).
