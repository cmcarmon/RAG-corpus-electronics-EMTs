The problem of designing vector quantizers for noisy signals is related to the problem of estimating the clean
signals from the noisy signals, as was shown by Wolf and Ziv in 1970 and Ephraim and Gray in 1988 [Ephraim,
1992]. Speciﬁcally, optimal waveform vector quantizers in the MMSE sense can be designed by ﬁrst estimating
the clean signal and then quantizing the estimated signal. Both estimation and quantization are performed in
the MMSE sense. Similarly, optimal quantization of the vector of parameters of the AR model for the speech
signal  in  the  Itakura-Saito  sense  can  be  performed  in  two  steps  of  estimation  and  quantization.  Speciﬁcally,
the autocorrelation function of the clean signal, which approximately constitutes the sufﬁcient statistics of that
signal for estimating the AR model, is ﬁrst estimated in the MMSE sense. Then, optimal vector quantization
in the Itakura-Saito sense is applied to the estimated autocorrelation.
