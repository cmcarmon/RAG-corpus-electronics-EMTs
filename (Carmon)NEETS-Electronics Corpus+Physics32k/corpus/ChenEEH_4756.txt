It is interesting to note that all these methods are developed
at a ﬁxed angle of attack and, in some cases, are tested at
another angle close to the design point, which serves to help
the researchers claim robustness of the designs. Here, the
problem is considered in a more general setting, where
the angle of attack is allowed to vary with time according to
the evolution of an external dynamical system (which may
represent the commands of the pilot together with the aircraft
dynamics). As will be noted subsequently, the dynamics of the
wing rock phenomenon change nonlinearly with the angle of
attack, which makes the problem of developing controllers that
are robust against angle of attack a challenging one. However,
this problem ﬁts the class of time-varying systems (Polycarpou
and Ioannu, 1991) considered in this chapter, so development
of a controller that can operate at all angles of attack is greatly
simpliﬁed by following theorem 1.
