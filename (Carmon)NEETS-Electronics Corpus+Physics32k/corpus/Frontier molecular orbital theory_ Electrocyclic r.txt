An electrocyclic reaction is a pericyclic reaction involving the net loss of a pi bond and creation of a sigma bond with formation of a ring. This reaction proceeds through either a conrotatory or disrotatory mechanism. In the conrotatory ring opening of cyclobutene, there are two electrons moving suprafacially (on the pi bond) and two moving antarafacially (on the sigma bond). This means there is one 4q + 2 suprafacial system and no 4r antarafacial system; thus the conrotatory process is thermally allowed by the Woodwardâ€“Hoffmann rules.
The HOMO of the sigma bond (i.e. a constructive bond) and the LUMO of the pi bond are important in the FMO theory consideration. If the ring opening uses a conrotatory process then the reaction results with the HOMO of butadiene. As in the previous examples the pi system moves from a LUMO species to a HOMO species, meaning this reaction is allowed.
