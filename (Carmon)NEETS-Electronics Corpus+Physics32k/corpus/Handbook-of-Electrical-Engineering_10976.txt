With continuous sinusoidal stimulation, it is possible to produce a series of action potentials that are phase-
locked  to  the  individual  sinusoidal  cycles,  as  noted  in  Fig.  113.8.  This  makes  the  sinusoidal  stimulus  much
more  potent  than  a  single  pulse  of  the  same  phase  duration.  This  potency  is  a  consequence  of  the  fact  that
perceived  magnitude  for  neurosensory  stimulation  and  muscle  tension  for  neuromuscular  stimulation  both
increase with the rate of action potential production.
