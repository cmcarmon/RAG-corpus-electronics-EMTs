Vestigial-sideband (VSB) AM is a variation of SSB where a small portion (or vestige) of
the ﬁltered sideband is allowed to remain. The stringent frequency-response requirements on the
sideband ﬁlter in an SSB AM system can be relaxed by allowing a part, known as a vestige, of
the unwanted sideband to appear at the output of the modulator. Thus, the design of the sideband
ﬁlter is simpliﬁed at the cost of a modest increase in the channel bandwidth required to transmit
the signal. Figure 15.2.7 illustrates the generation of a VSB AM signal. VSB is mainly used in the
