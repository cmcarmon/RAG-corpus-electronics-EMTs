This  equation  embodies  the 
  [Haykin,  1994;  Bishop,  1995].  It  can  be
rewritten as the product of a local activation (part 1) and a local error (part 2), exactly as the LMS and the
delta rules. But now the local error is a composition of errors that ï¬‚ow through the topology, which becomes
equivalent to the existence of a desired response at the PE.
