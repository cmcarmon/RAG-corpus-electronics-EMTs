Let’s use the same graph again, only extending the axes to indicate both positive and neg-
ative quantities. First we’ll apply an increasing ﬁeld force (current through the coils of our
electromagnet). We should see the ﬂux density increase (go up and to the right) according to
the normal magnetization curve:
