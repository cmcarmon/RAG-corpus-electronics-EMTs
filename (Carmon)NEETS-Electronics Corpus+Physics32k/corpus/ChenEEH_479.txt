Depending on the operation, a number of other effects can
occur that may have to be taken into account for certain
applications.
transistors
comes partially at the expense of lower breakdown voltages
in the BC and BE junctions due to larger doping concentra-
tions and shallower junction depths. Therefore, the corres-
ponding effect of BC avalanche breakdown (iAVL in Figure
5.9), which usually occurs in the internal transistor, often
needs to be taken into account (Maes et al., 1990; Rickelt and
