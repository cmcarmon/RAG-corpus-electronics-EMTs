for all a, b, and c, and similarly for any ﬁnite set of rv’s. A weak independence holds when the second moment
of the joint pdf, the correlation, factors as E[AB] = E[A]E[B], so that s
AB = 0, in which case the rv’s are said
to be uncorrelated. The covariance of A and B is a measure of how often A and B vary together (have the same
sign), how often they vary oppositely (different signs), and by how much, on the average over trials of outcomes.
To standardize so that units do not inﬂuence the measure of dependence, we use the correlation coefﬁcient
