As far as choices of lamps are concerned, metal halide and HPS are preferred over the mercury type. The
use of ﬂuorescent lamps in high-bay areas is limited. Only where the area proportions are such that the room
cavity ratios are in the range of 1 to 3 may ﬂuorescent lamps be acceptable. Only high or extra high output
ﬂuorescent in 8-ft sizes are recommended.
