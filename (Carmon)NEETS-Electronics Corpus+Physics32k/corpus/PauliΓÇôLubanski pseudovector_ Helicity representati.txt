In a special case, W→ is parallel to P→; or equivalently W→ × P→ = 0→.   For non-zero W→, this constraint can only be consistently imposed for luxons, since the commutator of the two transverse components of W→ is proportional to m2 J→ · P→. For this family, W 2 = 0 and Wμ = λPμ; the invariant is, instead, (W0)2 = (W3)2, where

All particles that interact with the Weak Nuclear Force, for instance, fall into this family, since the definition of weak nuclear charge (weak isospin) involves helicity, which, by above, must be an invariant. The appearance of non-zero mass in such cases must then be explained by other means, such as the Higgs mechanism. Even after accounting for such mass-generating mechanisms, however, the photon (and therefore the electromagnetic field) continues to fall into this class, although the other mass eigenstates of the carriers of the electroweak force (the W particle and anti-particle and Z particle) acquire non-zero mass.
Neutrinos were formerly considered to fall into this class as well. However, through neutrino oscillations, it is now known that at least two of the three mass eigenstates of the left-helicity neutrino and right-helicity anti-neutrino each must have non-zero mass.
