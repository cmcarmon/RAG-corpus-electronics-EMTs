The orbital plane of a revolving body is the geometric plane on which its orbit lies. A common example would be the centers of a massive body, of an orbiting body, and of the orbiting object at another time.
The orbital plane is defined in relation to a reference plane by two parameters: inclination (i) and longitude of the ascending node (Î©). Three non-collinear points in space suffice to determine the orbital plane.
By definition, the reference plane for the Solar System is usually considered to be Earth's orbital plane. This defines the ecliptic, the circular path on the celestial sphere that the Sun appears to follow over the course of a year.
In other cases, for instance a moon or artificial satellite orbiting another planet, it is convenient to define the inclination of the Moon's orbit as the angle between its orbital plane and the planet's equatorial plane.
