where b denotes the vector of component output variables and
a the vector of component input variables. The component
connection model can be obtained by redrawing the system of
Figure 7.1(A) as in Figure 7.1(B), where the components and
connections have been separated. Thus, the overall system is
composed of two interconnected boxes. One box contains the
components as described by equation 7.3, and the second
donut-shaped box contains the connections. The donut-
shaped box has inputs u and b and outputs a and y. Finally,
