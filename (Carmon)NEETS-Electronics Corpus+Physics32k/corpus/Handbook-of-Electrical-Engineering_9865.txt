We  desire  a  speciﬁc  PM  here,  and  so  the  equalizer  break  frequency  locations  are  speciﬁed.  There  is  a  single
parameter  here  that  is  unspeciﬁed,  and  an  additional  equation  must  be  found  in  any  speciﬁc  application.
Alternately, we could simply assume a nominal crossover frequency of unity or simply normalize frequencies
