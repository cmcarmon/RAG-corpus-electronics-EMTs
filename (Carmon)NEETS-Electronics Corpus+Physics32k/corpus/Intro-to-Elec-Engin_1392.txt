The connection of the high-power output of a transmitter located on a building to the
transmitting antenna on a tower is often made by special conductors called transmission lines,
which guide the waves and usually consist of two or more parallel conductors, which are separated
by insulating (dielectric) materials. While transmission lines are available in many forms, Figure
15.1.1 illustrates cross sections of some common types. The two-wire line of Figure 15.1.1(a) is
