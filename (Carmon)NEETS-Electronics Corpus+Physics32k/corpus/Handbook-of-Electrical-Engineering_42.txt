Wire-Wound  Resistors. Wire-wound  resistors  are  made  by  winding  wire  of  nickel-chromium  alloy  on  a
ceramic tube covering with a vitreous coating. The spiral winding has inductive and capacitive characteristics
that make it unsuitable for operation above 50 kHz. The frequency limit can be raised by noninductive winding
so that the magnetic Ô¨Åelds produced by the two parts of the winding cancel.
