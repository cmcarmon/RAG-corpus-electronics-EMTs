Example 2.18 
 
A voltage is changing at a uniform rate from 10 V 
to  50  V  in  a  period  of  0.1  s.  If  this  voltage  is 
applied  to  a  capacitor  of  22  µF,  determine  the 
current that will flow. 
 
Solution 
 
Now the current flowing will be given by: 
 
i = C × (rate of change of voltage) 
 
Thus
