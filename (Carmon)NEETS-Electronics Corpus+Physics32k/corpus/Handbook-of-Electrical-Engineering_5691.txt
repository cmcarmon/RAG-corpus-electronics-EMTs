The North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC) was formed in 1968, in the aftermath of the November
9,  1965,  northeast  blackout,  to  promote  the  reliability  of  bulk-electric-power  systems  of  North  America.
Transmission planning criteria presented here are partially based on NERC criteria as well as on speciﬁc criteria
used  by  transmission  planning  departments  from  three  electric  utility  companies:  American  Electric  Power
Service Corporation, Commonwealth Edison Company, and Paciﬁc Gas & Electric Company. NERC’s publi-
cations, developed by utility experts, have become standards for the industry. In most cases, these publications
are available at no charge from NERC, Princeton, N.J.
