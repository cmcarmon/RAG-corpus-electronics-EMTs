The author(s) of each chapter was given the task of providing broad coverage of the Ô¨Åeld while being restricted
to  only  a  few  pages  of  text.  As  a  result,  the  information  content  is  quite  high  and  tends  to  treat  the  main
principles or most useful topics in each area without giving the details or extensions of the subject. This practice,
, is what makes it a valuable new work in electrical engineering. In most
followed throughout the 
cases the information here will be complete enough. When this is not the case, the references will point the
way to whatever added information is necessary.
