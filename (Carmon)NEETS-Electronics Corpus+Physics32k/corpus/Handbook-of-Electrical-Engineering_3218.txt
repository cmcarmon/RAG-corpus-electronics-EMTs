AC Power Supplies
Some  applications  of  ac  power  supplies  are  ac  motor  drives,
uninterruptible power supply (UPS) used as a standby ac source
for  critical  loads  (e.g.,  in  hospitals,  computers),  and  dc  source-
to-utility  interface  (either  to  meet  peak  power  demands  or  to
augment  energy  by  connecting  unconventional  energy  sources
like photovoltaic arrays to the utility line). In ac induction motor
drives,  the  ac  power  main  is  rectiﬁed  and  ﬁltered  to  obtain  a
smooth dc source, and then an inverter (single-phase version is
shown in Fig. 30.38) is used to obtain a variable-frequency, vari-
able-voltage  ac  source.  The  sinusoidal  pulsewidth  modulation
technique described in Section 30.2 can be used to obtain a sinu-
soidal output voltage. Some other methods used to get sinusoidal
voltage  output  are  [Rashid,  1988]  a  number  of  phase-shifted
inverter  outputs  summed  in  an  output  transformer  to  get  a
stepped waveform that approximates a sine wave and the use of
a bang-bang controller in Fig. 30.38. All these methods use line-
frequency (60 Hz) transformers for voltage translation and iso-
lation  purposes.  To  reduce  the  size,  weight,  and  cost  of  such
systems, one can use dc-to-dc converters (discussed earlier) as an intermediate stage. Figure 30.39 shows such
a system in block schematic form. One can use an HF inverter circuit (discussed earlier) followed by a cycloconverter
stage. The major problem with these schemes is the reduction in efﬁciency due to the extra power stage. Figure
30.40 shows a typical UPS scheme. The battery shown has to be charged by a separate rectiﬁer circuit.
