As stated previously, a fiber optic transmitter is a hybrid electro-optic device. It converts electrical
signals into optical signals and launches the optical signals into an optical fiber. A fiber optic transmitter
consists of an interface circuit, a source drive circuit, and an optical source. The interface circuit accepts
the incoming electrical signal and processes it to make it compatible with the source drive circuit. The
source drive circuit intensity modulates the optical source by varying the current through it. The optical
signal is coupled into an optical fiber through the transmitter output interface.
