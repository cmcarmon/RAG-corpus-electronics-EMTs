In particle collider experiments, one often defines the angular position of a particle in terms of an azimuthal angle



ϕ


{\displaystyle \phi }
and pseudorapidity



η


{\displaystyle \eta }
. Additionally the transverse momentum,




p

T




{\displaystyle p_{T}}
, is usually measured. In this case if the particles are massless, or highly relativistic (



E
>>
m


{\displaystyle E>>m}
,) then the invariant mass becomes:
