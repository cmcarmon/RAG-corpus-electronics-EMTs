OSI brings to C3 a set of application services that had not been previously available. For example, the
OSI electronic mail standards (usually called X.400) provide message forwarding, distribution list cre-
ation and distribution, and obsolete message extraction among other services to users. In addition to
the security protocols contained in the lower layers of the OSI stack, X.400 has its own security services
such  as  message  origin  authentication,  message  ﬂow  conﬁdentiality,  message  content  integrity,  and
nonrepudiation of delivery, services that are highly desirable in C3 environments. OSI also has enhanced
ﬁle transfer and management capabilities, systems management, directory, and transaction processing,
among other application functions, all providing enhanced capability to C3 users.
