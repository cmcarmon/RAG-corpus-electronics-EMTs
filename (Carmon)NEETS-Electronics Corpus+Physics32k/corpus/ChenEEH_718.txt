Technology-wise, the basic access speed of memory planes
increases slowly (less than 10% per year [Przybylski, 1997]). In
contrast, the speed of the data path is doubling every 18 months
(Moore’s law). As a result, the performance gap between memory
and data path increases rapidly. Advanced memory implemen-
tations are used to keep up with the path speed, but, in many
cases, these can be quite energy consuming. Note that the max-
imal power consumption is not relevant in this context but that
the actual energy consumed to execute a given application in a
speciﬁc time period (cycle budget) is important. In many cases,
from the application point of view, the external memory organ-
ization is used in an inefﬁcient way. Sometimes data caches can
overcome the problems partly at runtime, but these caches have
a big area and energy overhead, especially when they are set-
associative (Kamble and Ghose, 1997; Ko et al., 1995; Su and
Despain, 1995). Future memory organization solutions will have
to provide more effective bandwidth at a reasonable actual
energy consumption.
