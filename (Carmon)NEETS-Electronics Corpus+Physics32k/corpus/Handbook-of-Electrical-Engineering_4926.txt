where b is known as the Stewart-McCumber parameter. Clearly, if b >> 1, the capacitive time constant R jCj
dominates the dynamics of the circuit. Thus, as the bias current is raised from zero, no time-average voltage
is created until the critical current Ic is exceeded. At this point, the junciton switches to a voltage consistent
with the breaking of the Cooper pairs, 2D/e, with a time constant 
. Once the junction has latched in the
voltage state, however, the capacitor has charged up and the only way for it to discharge is to lower the bias
current to zero again. As a result, a device with b >>1 will have a hysteretic current-voltage curve as shown in
Fig. 53.4a. Conversely, b << 1 implies that the capacitance of the device is unimportant and so the current-
voltage curve is not hysteretic (see Fig. 53.4b). In fact, the time-averaged voltage Ænæ for such an RSJ device is
