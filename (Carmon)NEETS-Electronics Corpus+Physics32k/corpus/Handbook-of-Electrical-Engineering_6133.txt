The safe grounding of power system equipment is very important, especially as the short circuit capability of
power systems continues to grow. Programs have been developed to evaluate and design grounding systems in
areas containing major power equipment, such as substations and to evaluate the effects of fault current on
remote, separately grounded equipment.
