ï¬‚ashes, or current pulses). Usually the stimulus consists of a few hundred to about 1000 pulses, averaged to
produce  the  somatosensory-evoked  potential  (SSEP).  Likewise,  it  is  possible  to  evaluate  the  integrity  of  the
neural  pathways  from  the  motor  cortex  to  peripheral  muscles  by  applying  multiple  short-duration  current
pulses  to  scalp  electrodes  and  recording  nerve  and/or  muscle  action  potentials  with  skin-surface  electrodes.
Such recordings are called motor-evoked potentials (MEPs). With both SSEPs and MEPs, the largest responses
appear on the opposite side of the body from the stimulus.
