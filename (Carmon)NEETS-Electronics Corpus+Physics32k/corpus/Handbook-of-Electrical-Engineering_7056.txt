It is therefore desirable to have an efﬁcient coding procedure that works for long blocks of source symbols.
Huffman coding is not ideal for this situation, since it is a bottom-up procedure with a complexity that grows
rapidly with the block length. Arithmetic coding is an incremental coding algorithm that works efﬁciently for
long block lengths and achieves an average length within one bit of the entropy for the block.
