The motion of a rolling cone can be described as a combination of a rotational motion of the cone around its axis of symmetry, and a rotary motion of its axis around the axis of symmetry of the stationary cone. The ratio between the angular velocities of these two motions is given by:

{\displaystyle {\frac {\omega _{2}}{\omega _{1}}}={\sin \alpha  \over \sin \beta }}

where



α


{\displaystyle \alpha }
and



β


{\displaystyle \beta }
are the half apex angles of the stationary cone and the rolling cone, respectively,




ω

1




{\displaystyle \omega _{1}}
is the angular velocity of the rolling cone's axis of symmetry around the axis of symmetry of the stationary cone, and




ω

2




{\displaystyle \omega _{2}}
is the angular velocity of the rolling cone around its own axis of symmetry. In the special case of a cone rolling on a flat surface, this ratio becomes



sin
⁡
α


{\displaystyle \sin \alpha }
, where



α


{\displaystyle \alpha }
is the cone's half apex angle. For example, a cone having an apex angle of 120 degrees, while being rolled on a flat surface, will perform exactly two full rotations around its axis of symmetry before returning to its original position.
