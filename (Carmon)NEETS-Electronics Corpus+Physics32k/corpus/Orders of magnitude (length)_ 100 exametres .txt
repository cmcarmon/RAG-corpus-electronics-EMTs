To help compare different orders of magnitude, this section lists distances starting at 100 Em (1020 m or 11,000 light years).
150 Em – 16,000 light years – Diameter of the Small Magellanic Cloud, a dwarf galaxy orbiting the Milky Way
200 Em – 21,500 light years – Distance to OGLE-2005-BLG-390Lb, the most distant and the most Earth-like planet known
240 Em – 25,000 light years – Distance to the Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy
260 Em – 28,000 light years – Distance to the center of the Galaxy
830 Em – 88,000 light years – Distance to the Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy
>950 Em – >100,000 light years – Diameter of the disc of the Milky Way Galaxy
