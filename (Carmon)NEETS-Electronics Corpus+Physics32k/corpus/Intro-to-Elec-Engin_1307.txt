Figure 14.1.5 shows a block diagram in which an arbitrary linear network characterized by its
ac transfer function H(jω) has an input signal x(t) yielding an output signal y(t). Note that H(jω)
is represented here in terms of the amplitude ratio and phase shift as a function of frequency f
given by |H (f )| = |H (j ω)| and θ (f ) = (cid:2) H (j ω), respectively, where ω is related to f through
the relation ω = 2πf .
If x(t) contains a sinusoidal component of magnitude A1 and phase φ1 at frequency f 1, the
corresponding output component of the linear network will have amplitude |H (f1)| A1 and phase
φ1 + θ (f1). If, on the other hand, the input should consist of several sinusoids given by
