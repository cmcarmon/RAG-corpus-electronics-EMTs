used the same way as the photocell, as a light- variable 
resistor. Photodiodes are semiconductor devices that 
are made primarily from silicon. They are  constructed 
in two ways. One method is as a simple PN  junction 
(Figure 35-5). The other method inserts an  intrinsic 
(undoped)  layer  between  the  P  and  N   regions 
 (FigureÂ 35-6), forming a PIN photodiode.
