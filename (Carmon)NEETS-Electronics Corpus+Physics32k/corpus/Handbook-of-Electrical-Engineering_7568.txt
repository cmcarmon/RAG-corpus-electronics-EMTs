might  be  a  relay,  an  indicator  light,  or  an  LED  display.  Also,  two  or  more  open  collector  gates  can  share  a
common load, resulting in the anding together of the individual gate functions. This is called a “wired-AND
connection.” In any application, there must be some form of load or the device will not function. There is a
lower limit to the resistance of this load which is determined by the current rating of the open collector transistor.
For wired-AND applications the resistance range depends on how many outputs are being wired and on the
load  being  driven  by  the  wired  outputs.  Formulas  are  given  in  the  data  books.  Since  the  open  collector
conﬁguration does not have the speed enhancement associated with an active pull-up, the low to high propa-
gation delay (tPLH) is about double that of the totem-pole output. It should be observed that totem-pole outputs
should not be wired, since excessive currents in the active pull-up circuit could result.
