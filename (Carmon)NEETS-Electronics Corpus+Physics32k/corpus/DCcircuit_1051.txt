As with the Thevenin equivalent circuit, the only useful information from this analysis is
the voltage and current values for R2; the rest of the information is irrelevant to the original
circuit. However, the same advantages seen with Thevenin’s Theorem apply to Norton’s as
well: if we wish to analyze load resistor voltage and current over several different values of
load resistance, we can use the Norton equivalent circuit again and again, applying nothing
more complex than simple parallel circuit analysis to determine what’s happening with each
trial load.
