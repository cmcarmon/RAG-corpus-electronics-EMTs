Other semiconductor materials parameters of interest include thermal, dielectric constant, energy bandgap,
electric breakdown characteristics, and minority carrier lifetime. The thermal conductivity of the material is
important because it describes how easily heat can be extracted from the device. The thermal conductivity has
units of W/cm-K. Generally, high thermal conductivity is desirable. Compound semiconductors, such as GaAs
and InP, have relatively poor thermal conductivity compared to elemental semiconductors such as Si. Materials
such as SiC have excellent thermal conductivity and have uses in high-power electronic devices. The dielectric
constant is important since it affects the size of the semiconductor device. The larger the dielectric constant,
the smaller the device. Electric breakdown characteristics are important since breakdown limits the magnitudes
of the dc and RF voltages that can be applied to the device. This is turn limits the RF power that can be handled
by  the  device.  The  electric  breakdown  for  the  material  is  generally  described  by  the  critical  value  of  electric
ﬁeld that produces avalanche ionization. Minority carrier lifetime is important for bipolar devices, such as pn
junction diodes, rectiﬁers, and bipolar junction transistors (BJTs). A low value for minority carrier lifetime is
desirable for devices such as diode temperature sensors and switches where low reverse bias leakage current is
desirable. A long minority carrier lifetime is desirable for devices such as bipolar transistors. For materials such
as Si and SiC, the minority carrier lifetime can be varied by controlled impurity doping. A comparison of some
of the important material parameters for several common semiconductors is presented in Table 39.2.
