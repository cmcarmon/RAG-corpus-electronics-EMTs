Gain scheduling is a practical and powerful method for the
control of nonlinear systems. A gain-scheduled controller is
formed by interpolating between a set of linear controllers
derived for a corresponding set of plant linearizations associ-
ated with several operating points. The interpolation is based
on exogenous scheduling parameters that vary slowly and
capture the plant nonlinearities. The resulting controller is a
linear system whose parameters (gains) are adjusted (sched-
uled) as a function of the exogenous scheduling variables.
