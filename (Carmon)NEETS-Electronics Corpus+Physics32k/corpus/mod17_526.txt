The locating and tracking of a synchronous satellite is relatively simple. This is because the satellite 
appears to be stationary. Locating a near-synchronous satellite is also relatively simple because of the 
slow relative motion of the satellite However, the movement of a near-synchronous satellite is enough 
that accurate tracking is required to keep the narrow beam antenna pointed toward the satellite. Satellites 
in medium altitude circular orbits or in elliptical orbits are more difficult to acquire and to track because 
of the rapid changes in position.
