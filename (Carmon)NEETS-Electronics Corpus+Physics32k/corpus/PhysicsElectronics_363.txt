semiconductor has the valence band close to the conduction band â€“ separated by about a
1 eV gap. Conductors on the other hand have the conduction and valence bands overlapping.
The interesting property of a semiconductor is that thermally excited electrons can move
from the valence band to the conduction band and conduct current. Silicon and germanium
have thermally excited electrons at room temperature and hence their common use in diodes
and transistors.
