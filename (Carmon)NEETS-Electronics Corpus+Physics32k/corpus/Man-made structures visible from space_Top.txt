Man-made structures visible from earth orbit without magnification (by mechanical aids such as a camera or binoculars) include highways, dams, and cities. The most commonly cited example, the Great Wall of China, is barely visible from low Earth orbit, and even then only under perfect conditions, but not from the Moon.
Part of the problem in authoritatively answering questions about visibility from space is that such questions are often very vaguely framed: askers frequently do not precisely define how far above sea level their hypothetical or actual observer in space is located. When just speaking of "space", an asker might mean anywhere from the edge of space (Kármán line) at an altitude of 100 kilometers (62 mi) to low Earth orbit of 160–2,000 km (99-1200 mi) to Apollo 12's orbit at 290 km (180 mi) to the Moon, which orbits about 381,415 km (237,000 mi) away. The Kármán line is accepted by the World Air Sports Federation, an international standard setting and record-keeping body for aeronautics and astronautics, as the boundary between the Earth's atmosphere and outer space. However, a practical definition for the purpose of answering questions on what astronauts generally can see from space would reflect altitudes that manned spacecraft typically orbit the Earth at—often several hundreds of kilometres. Because of the inverse square law, there are major differences in visibility from just above the Kármán line (100 km/62 miles) and the ISS orbit (394 km/245 miles), for example.
