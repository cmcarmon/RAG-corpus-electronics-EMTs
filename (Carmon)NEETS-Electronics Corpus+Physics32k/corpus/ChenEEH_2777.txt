From Figure 9.10(A), we see that the trailing edge of the
Gaussian pulse is contaminated by a rapidly oscillating and
growing noise component that does not exist in Figure 9.8(A),
which shows the same Gaussian pulse at the same time but
with S  1:0. In fact, the noise component in Figure 9.10(A)
results from the onset of numerical instability in the grid due
to S ¼ 1:0005 > 1:0. Because this noise grows exponentially
with time-step number n, it quickly overwhelms the desired
numerical results for the propagating Gaussian pulse. Shortly
thereafter, the exponential growth of the noise increases the
calculated ﬁeld values beyond the dynamic range of the com-
puter being used, resulting in run-time ﬂoating-point over-
ﬂows and errors.
Figure 9.10(B) is an expanded view of Figure 9.10(A) be-
tween grid points i ¼ 1 and i ¼ 20, showing a segment of the
numerical noise on the trailing edge of the Gaussian pulse. We
see that the noise oscillates with a spatial period of 2 grid cells
